item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a vertically integrated manufacturer and marketer of petrochemicals  polymers and fabricated products 
our two principal business segments are olefins and vinyls 
we use the majority of our internally produced basic chemicals to produce higher value added chemicals and fabricated products 
consumption of the basic chemicals that we manufacture in the commodity portions of our olefins and vinyls processes has increased significantly over the past years 
our olefins and vinyls products are some of the most widely used chemicals in the world and are upgraded into a wide variety of higher value added chemical products used in many end markets 
petrochemicals are typically manufactured in large volume by a number of different producers using widely available technologies 
the petrochemical industry exhibits cyclical commodity characteristics  and margins are influenced by changes in the balance between supply and demand and the resulting operating rates  the level of general economic activity and the price of raw materials 
the cycle is generally characterized by periods of tight supply  leading to high operating rates and margins  followed by a decline in operating rates and margins primarily as a result of significant capacity additions 
due to the significant size of new plants  capacity additions are built in large increments and typically require several years of demand growth to be absorbed 
in and the olefins and vinyls markets began a cyclical recovery and operating rates and margins began to increase as economic growth improved and excess capacity was absorbed 
these factors resulted in increased industry product margins in  and in our vinyls segment  industry forecasts estimate that pvc industry operating rates dropped to for the fourth quarter of from in the third quarter of this downturn was primarily due to weakness in the residential housing market and a reduction of inventory by pvc converters due to falling prices 
the decline started in september and continued through december looking forward  north american pvc capacity is projected to increase by in and in demand for pvc is expected to increase by per year over the next five years 
as a result  operating rates could decline from peak levels achieved in early in our olefins segment  industry ethylene operating rates reached a peak of in the second quarter of and trended down to in the fourth quarter of over the next five years some industry forecasts show a per year increase in worldwide ethylene capacity with the largest increase in the middle east and asia 
demand is expected to grow per year during this period 
operating rates in the us are expected to peak in and decline gradually during the remainder of the decade primarily due to reduced exports 
we purchase significant amounts of ethane and propane feedstock  natural gas  chlorine and salt from external suppliers for use in production of basic chemicals in the olefins and vinyls chains 
we also purchase significant amounts of electricity to supply the energy required in our production processes 
while we have agreements providing for the supply of ethane and propane feedstocks  natural gas  chlorine  salt and electricity  the contractual prices for these raw materials and energy vary with market conditions and may be highly volatile 
factors which have caused volatility in our raw material prices in the past and which may do so in the future  include shortages of raw materials due to increasing demand  capacity constraints due to construction delays  strike action or involuntary shutdowns  the general level of business and economic activity  and the direct or indirect effect of governmental regulation 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins  as sales price increases generally tend to lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers seek relief in the form of lower sales prices 
we currently use derivative instruments to reduce price 
table of contents volatility risk on feedstock commodities and lower overall costs 
normally  there is a pricing relationship between a commodity that we process and the feedstock from which it is derived 
when this pricing relationship deviates from historical norms  we have from time to time entered into derivative instruments and physical positions in an attempt to take advantage of this relationship 
our historical results have been significantly affected by our plant production capacity  our efficient use of the capacity and our ability to increase our capacity 
since our inception  we have followed a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on plant acquisitions  new plant construction and internal expansion 
we evaluate each expansion project on the basis of its ability to produce sustained returns in excess of our cost of capital and its ability to improve efficiency or reduce operating costs 
on november   we closed the acquisition of eastman chemical company s polyethylene and epolene polymers businesses  related assets and a mile  inch pipeline from mont belvieu  texas to longview  texas  all of which are headquartered in longview  texas 
the purchase price was million in cash  which included working capital  and is subject to working capital adjustments 
the polyethylene business and associated operating facilities have a capacity of  million pounds per year of polyethylene 
this capacity is comprised of million pounds per year of low density polyethylene ldpe and million pounds of linear low density polyethylene lldpe and high density polyethylene hdpe 
with this acquisition  our total polyethylene capacity is now in excess of billion pounds per year 
we also acquired technology for the production of specialty polyolefin polymers including acrylate co polymers  epolene polymers for the adhesives  coatings and other consumer products markets  and energx technology for lldpe and hdpe  which is designed to provide enhanced strength and performance properties 
we believe that the acquisition of these assets is an excellent strategic fit  will further strengthen our position in the north american polyethylene market and will increase our ability to provide an improved overall product mix and new technology 
in addition  during we purchased additional interests in suzhou huasu plastics co 
ltd  our joint venture in china 
all governmental approvals were obtained and the transaction closed in the second quarter of we increased our ownership percentage from approximately to approximately at a cost of million million was paid in the fourth quarter of and million was paid in the second quarter of 
we will continue to account for this investment using the equity method of accounting because the entity does not meet the definition of a variable interest entity under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december an interpretation of arb no 
 and because contractual arrangements allowing certain substantive participatory rights to minority shareholders prevent us from exercising a controlling financial interest over this entity 
on april   we announced that we had entered into a memorandum of understanding to develop an ethane based ethylene  polyethylene and other derivatives project in the republic of trinidad and tobago 
the government of the republic of trinidad and tobago has expressed an interest in becoming a minority equity partner in the project 
as currently envisioned  the project would use  barrels per day of ethane to produce  metric tons billion pounds per year of ethylene  which would in turn be used to produce polyethylene and other derivative products 
the project could be expanded in the future as more ethane becomes available 
the capital cost is initially estimated to be approximately billion 
the size  scope  and cost of the project are subject to further definition in connection with a detailed feasibility study that we are currently performing 
it is expected that the project will be financed through a project financing arrangement 
the preliminary project schedule contemplates that construction would start in late and that the project would start operations in late in the second quarter of  we completed a major maintenance turnaround in calvert city 
the ethylene and vcm units at calvert city were down for days while the chlor alkali and pvc units were down for a shorter period 
sales continued during the turnaround from inventory on hand 
in early september  we encountered mechanical problems with a compressor and related equipment at one of our ethylene units in lake charles  louisiana  resulting in an unscheduled shutdown of that unit 
while that unit was down  we completed a 
table of contents maintenance turnaround of that unit that was scheduled for early during the unit s shut down  we also completed portions of our previously announced project to upgrade the feedstock flexibility at our ethylene plant  which is expected to reduce energy costs and provide for additional ethylene capacity 
the unit was successfully restarted in late october and resumed full production 
as a result of the lake charles outage  we incurred approximately million in maintenance expense and million in turnaround costs which have been capitalized 
we are also planning additional major turnarounds during at our lake charles facility 
early in the second quarter of  we expect to shut down one of our ethylene units for approximately days to tie in the project designed to upgrade the feedstock flexibility 
in the fourth quarter of  we are planning to complete a major maintenance turnaround at our lake charles styrene facility  which is expected to take approximately days

summary for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million 
this compares to the year ended december  net income of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million 
results for included an after tax charge which reduced net income by million  or per diluted share  related to the early retirement of debt and a tax benefit which increased net income by million  or per diluted share 
the tax benefit was related to the reversal of various tax accruals due to the resolution of certain tax matters  the refinement of the estimate of deferred income taxes and the extra territorial exclusion income benefit 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  for the first nine months of  net income and income from operations were greater than the first nine months of however  the residential housing market slow down  inventory reduction 
table of contents partly due to falling prices and partly due to the lack of hurricane activity on the us gulf coast and normal seasonal weakness resulted in a very weak fourth quarter of by comparison  the fourth quarter of was very strong due in large part to the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
income from operations during was also negatively impacted by lower production volumes  higher feedstock costs and higher maintenance expense due to a maintenance turnaround at our facility in calvert city  kentucky and the day unscheduled outage at one of our ethylene units at lake charles  louisiana 
these negative impacts were partially offset by improved feedstock commodity trading gains of million in compared to a loss of million in for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million 
this compared favorably with the year ended december  net income of million  or per diluted share  on net sales of  million 
results for included an after tax charge of million  or per diluted share  related to the early retirement of debt 
income from operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  these increases were primarily due to higher sales volumes in the company s vinyls segment and higher selling prices for the company s olefins and vinyls products  which outpaced higher feedstock and energy costs 
net income for also benefited from lower interest expense resulting from lower debt balances 
compared with net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for our major products and higher sales volumes for pvc resin and polyethylene which was largely offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene  vcm  and pvc pipe 
higher selling prices largely resulted from higher raw material costs that were generally passed through to customers 
pvc resin sales volumes increased primarily due to the supply of additional volumes from our geismar facility and polyethylene sales volumes increased primarily due to the acquisition of the longview facilities 
sales volumes for other major products were down largely due to the slowing market for new home construction  inventory reductions in the second half of and increased internal consumption of ethylene at our geismar facility 
gross margin 
gross margin percentage decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to turnaround maintenance activity and weak demand in the fourth quarter of for many of our major products as customers generally reduced their inventories 
maintenance costs increased due to the outages at lake charles and calvert city and additional fixed costs were expensed as several of the facilities curtailed production late in the year due to declining demand 
in addition  margins decreased due to higher raw material costs 
our raw materials costs in both segments normally track industry prices  which experienced  according to cmai  an increase of for ethane and for propane in as compared to as previously discussed  we use derivative instruments in conjunction with certain physical commodity positions to reduce price volatility risk on commodities and take advantage of pricing relationships 
in  cost of sales benefited from an improved feedstock commodity trading gain of million compared to a loss of million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher professional fees  the goodrich settlement in with no comparable activity in see note to the consolidated financial statements  additional headcount as a result of the acquisition of the longview facilities and higher sales commissions 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million in to million from million in average interest rates were lower in due to the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes on january  and the redemption of the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes in february 
table of contents debt retirement cost 
as a result of the redemption of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and the repayment of million of our term loan  we recognized million in non operating expense in the first quarter of  consisting of a pre payment premium on our senior notes of million and a write off of million in previously capitalized debt issuance cost 
we recognized million in non operating expense in the first quarter of resulting from a write off in previously capitalized debt issuance cost in connection with the repayment of million of our term loan 
other income  net 
other income  net increased by million to million in from million in primarily due to higher interest income associated with higher cash balances and higher interest rates  increased equity in income from our joint venture in china  and a derivative loss reflected in income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in the current year rate is below the statutory rate of primarily due to the release of  among other things  a tax benefit related to the reversal of various tax accruals due to the resolution of certain tax matters 
this reduced the rate approximately percentage points 
in addition  adjustments were made to income taxes for deferred income taxes  tax benefits related to extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits eti  tax benefits related to tax exempt interest and the manufacturing deduction 
these reductions in the effective tax rate were partially offset by state taxes 
the effective income tax rate of was lower than the statutory rate of due to eti approximately percentage points  tax benefits related to the new domestic manufacturing deduction and other adjustments to deferred income taxes partially offset by state taxes 
olefins segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in sales improved due to higher sales prices throughout the olefins segment  which were largely offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene 
polyethylene sales volumes increased due to the acquisition of the longview facilities on november  average selling prices for the olefins segment increased by in as compared to higher selling prices were primarily the result of our ability to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers 
overall sales volumes for the olefins segment decreased primarily due to an increase in the internal requirements for ethylene at our geismar facility 
sales volumes were also impacted by inventory reductions by our customers and the housing slowdown that has occurred in the us as previously discussed 
income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to higher raw material costs for ethane and propane  lower overall sales volumes and higher expenses related to the unscheduled outage and maintenance turnaround at one of our lake charles ethylene units 
this decrease was partially offset by price increases throughout the olefins segment which resulted in higher profit margins for polyethylene and ethylene although profit margins for these products dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of income from operations also benefited from an improved feedstock trading gain of million compared to a loss of million in vinyls segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to overall higher selling prices for our vinyls products  especially pvc resin  and higher sales volumes of pvc resin 
average selling prices for the vinyls segment increased by in as compared to as we were able to pass along higher raw material costs to our customers 
overall  the vinyls segment sales volumes decreased by compared to as a result of declines in vcm and pvc fabricated product sales volumes 
pvc resin sales volumes increased primarily due to additional volumes from the geismar facility 
pvc pipe sales volumes were negatively impacted by the slowing rate of new home construction in the us and inventory reductions by our customers 

table of contents income from operations 
income from operations decreased by million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to lower production volumes and higher maintenance expense related to the planned maintenance turnaround at our calvert city facility that occurred in may  higher raw material costs and a significant reduction in demand for most of our vinyls products in the fourth quarter of as previously discussed 
selling prices and sales volumes decreased significantly in the fourth quarter resulting in lower operating rates and higher unabsorbed cost 
the higher raw material costs resulted in lower margins for several of our products despite higher sales prices 
compared with net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to price increases throughout our olefins and vinyls segments and higher sales volumes in vcm  pvc resin and pvc pipe 
higher selling prices largely resulted from stronger demand for our products and higher raw material costs that were generally passed through to customers 
pvc pipe sales in were higher than in due to the august acquisition of the assets of bristolpipe corporation 
gross margin 
gross margins increased to in from in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices throughout our olefins and vinyls segments and higher sales volumes for vcm  pvc resin and pvc pipe resulting from increased demand 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene  polyethylene and styrene  higher raw material costs for ethane  propane and benzene and higher energy costs 
our raw materials costs in both segments normally track industry prices  which experienced  according to cmai  an increase of for ethane  for propane and for benzene in as compared to a fire at our calvert city ethylene plant also negatively impacted our gross margin 
we estimate that the gross margin impact of the outage in relating to the fire was approximately million  which was comprised of higher maintenance cost of million  lost margin on sales of approximately million and a write off of equipment of million 
gross margin decreased by million due to feedstock related trading losses in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased million  or  in as compared to the increase was primarily due to costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act  higher legal and environmental consultant fees  increased sales commissions and increased costs resulting from the bristolpipe acquisition  partially offset by lower provision for doubtful accounts 
sg a costs in also increased as compared to due to the receipt of million in the first quarter of resulting from a legal settlement with a customer 
gain on sale of asset 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold a co generation unit that was included in the purchase of the geismar assets 
we recognized a million gain from the sale of those assets 
we did not have any gain or loss on sale of assets in impairment of long lived assets 
impairment of long lived assets of million in was related to an idled pvc plant in pace  florida in the vinyls segment million that was written down to its estimated sales value less commissions and ethylene assets in our olefins segment million which were written down to their remaining fair market value 
we did not have any impairments of long lived assets in interest expense 
interest expense in decreased by million to million from million in due to lower average debt balances  which were partially offset by higher average interest rates 
the average monthly debt balance decreased by million to million in from million in debt retirement cost

other income  net 
other income  net of million in increased slightly over the million in as reflected improved interest and derivative income  partially offset by lower earnings from our joint venture in china and insurance proceeds received in income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in as compared to in the effective income tax rate is lower than the statutory rate of due to extraterritorial income eti exclusion tax benefits of approximately  tax benefit of approximately related to the new domestic manufacturing deduction and other provision adjustments partially offset by state taxes 
the effective income tax rate is higher than the statutory rate primarily due to state taxes 
olefins segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from  million in this increase was primarily due to price increases for all of our olefins segment products 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene  polyethylene and styrene 
average selling prices for the olefins segment increased by in as compared to these increased prices were due primarily to higher industry demand and higher energy and raw material costs that were generally passed through to customers 
the decrease in sales volumes resulted primarily from a three week outage caused by hurricane rita 
in addition  styrene sales volumes decreased due to lower demand and merchant ethylene sales volumes decreased because our internal requirements for ethylene at geismar increased 
income from operations 
income from operations increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to price increases for ethylene  polyethylene and styrene 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes for ethylene  polyethylene and styrene  higher raw material costs for ethane  propane and benzene and higher energy costs 
vinyls segment net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to  million in from million in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for all of our vinyls segment products and higher sales volumes for vcm  pvc resin and pvc pipe 
average selling prices for the vinyls segment increased by in as compared to these increases were largely due to stronger industry demand for our products and higher raw material costs for propane and chlorine that were generally passed through to our customers 
in addition to strong industry demand  pvc pipe sales volume also increased due to the august acquisition of the assets of bristolpipe corporation 
income from operations 
income from operations increased by million to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for all of our vinyls segment products and higher sales volumes for vcm  pvc resin and pvc pipe  partially offset by higher energy costs and higher raw material costs for propane and chlorine 
the earnings for were adversely impacted by a fire at the calvert city ethylene plant 
we estimate that the impact on income from operations from the outage relating to the fire was approximately million 
cash flows operating activities operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in income from operations  debt retirement costs of million  turnaround costs of million and higher income tax 
table of contents payments in tax payments are higher in than because benefited from utilization of net operating loss and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
changes in components of working capital  which we define for purposes of this cash flow discussion as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expense and other current assets less accounts payable and accrued liabilities  used cash of million in  compared to million of cash used in this change represents a decrease in cash use of million 
in  inventory increased by million primarily due to a drop in demand late in the year 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities excluding those accruals that are included in the section cash flows from investing activities increased by million during operating activities provided cash of million in compared to million in the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in as compared to was primarily due to improvements in income from operations  as described above  and less cash used for working capital 
income from operations increased by million in as compared to changes in components of working capital used cash of million in  compared to million cash used in  a decrease of cash used of million 
in  receivables increased by million largely due to higher selling prices while inventory increased by million  primarily due to higher feedstock and energy prices 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million largely due to higher raw material and energy costs 
the primary reasons for the million use of cash in related to working capital components were a million increase in receivables and a million increase in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the increase in receivables was mainly due to higher average selling prices and sales volumes 
the increase in inventories was primarily due to higher feedstock and energy prices 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities was primarily due to higher energy and raw material costs 
investing activities net cash used for investing activities during was million as compared to million in capital expenditures were million in as compared to million in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to a project designed to upgrade the feedstock flexibility in one of our ethylene plants at our lake charles facility and a project to expand our ethylene capacity 
the remaining capital expenditures in primarily related to maintenance  safety and environmental projects 
the capital expenditures in primarily related to maintenance  safety and environmental projects 
over the next two years  the company expects to increase capital expenditures related to environmental compliance from million in to million in and million in a significant percentage of the and estimated amounts are related to equipment replacement and upgrades to maintain environmental compliance 
we used million in cash during to acquire the longview facilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the additions to equity investments of million in related to the additional equity interest purchased in suzhou huasu plastics co 
ltd  our joint venture in china  as discussed previously 
in addition  the settlement of derivative instruments in was an outflow due to the settlement on derivative losses recognized in  which was partially offset by cash settlement receipts from net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in and million in we made capital expenditures in of million 
these expenditures were for technological modifications to the edc plant in geismar  louisiana and start up of the vcm and pvc portions of our facilities in geismar million  and we invested million in a project designed to upgrade the feedstock flexibility in our ethylene plant and a project to expand our ethylene capacity 
the remaining capital expenditures of million were related to maintenance  safety and environmental projects 
the million equity investment represents an additional equity investment in an unconsolidated subsidiary 
we made capital expenditures in of million for refurbishment and upgrades related to the january fire at the calvert city ethylene plant million  technological modifications at the geismar facility million and maintenance capital  safety and environmental related projects million 
the acquisition of business of million related to the acquisition of the assets of bristolpipe corporation  which was completed on 
table of contents august  these expenditures were partially offset by million of proceeds from the disposition of assets and million of insurance proceeds 
we made capital expenditures in of million primarily related to maintenance  safety and environmental projects 
these expenditures were partially offset by million of insurance proceeds 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities during was million as compared to million in during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior notes  which was offset by the repayment of million of debt and the payment of million of cash dividends 
we also incurred million in costs associated with the debt repayment that were capitalized and that will be amortized over the term of the senior notes 
during we used million to repay debt and million to pay dividends 
financing activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in during  we used million to repay debt and million to pay dividends  which was partially offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options 
in august we completed the initial public offering of our common stock the ipo 
net proceeds from the ipo of million and cash generated from operating activities were used to repay million of debt and affiliate borrowings in see liquidity and capital resources below 
in  we incurred million in costs associated with the refinancing that were capitalized and that will be amortized over the term of the new debt 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and financing arrangements our principal sources of liquidity are from cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and our long term financing 
as discussed previously  we are currently performing a feasibility study in connection with the potential development of an ethane based ethylene  polyethylene and other derivatives project in the republic of trinidad and tobago 
the capital cost is initially estimated to be approximately billion  in which we would be a majority partner 
if this project is approved  construction could commence in late it is expected that we would invest some level of cash and the remainder would be financed through a project financing arrangement 
we believe that our sources of liquidity as described above  along with any additional project financing  will be adequate to fund our cash requirements 
cash cash balances were million at december  compared to million at december  in addition  we have a revolving credit facility available to supplement cash if needed  as described under debt below 
debt our million senior secured revolving credit facility is a source of liquidity 
as of december   any borrowings under the revolving credit facility bore interest at either libor plus or prime rate minus 
the revolving credit facility also requires an unused commitment fee of 
all interest rates under the facility are subject to quarterly grid pricing adjustments based on a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the facility matures on january  as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million and available borrowing capacity of million under this facility 
as of december   our long term debt  including current maturities  totaled million  consisting of million principal amount of senior notes due and a million loan from the 
table of contents proceeds of tax exempt revenue bonds supported by an million letter of credit 
debt outstanding under the tax exempt bonds bears interest at variable rates 
on january   we issued million of aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  the proceeds of which  together with cash on hand  were used to redeem our senior notes due and repay our term loan as follows on january   we repaid the entire million outstanding under our term loan  plus accrued but unpaid interest 
on two redemption dates  february  and february   we redeemed the entire million principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due  and paid a pre payment premium of million  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
as a result of the early redemption of the senior notes due and the repayment of the term loan  we recognized million in non operating expense in the first quarter of consisting of a pre payment premium on the senior notes of million and a write off of million in previously capitalized debt issuance cost 
the senior notes are unsecured and were issued with an original issue discount of million 
there is no sinking fund and no scheduled amortization of the notes prior to maturity 
the notes are subject to redemption and the holders may require us to repurchase the notes upon a change of control 
all domestic restricted subsidiaries that guarantee other debt of ours or of another guarantor of the senior notes in excess of million are guarantors of the notes 
the agreements governing the senior notes and the revolving credit facility each contain customary covenants and events of default 
accordingly  these agreements impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions  among other things  provide limitations on incurrence of additional indebtedness  the payment of dividends  certain investments and acquisitions and sales of assets 
these limitations are subject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions  including  without limitation  an exception for the payment of our regular quarterly dividend of up to per share currently per share 
the senior notes indenture does not allow distributions  including dividends and certain other restricted payments unless  after giving pro forma effect to the distribution  our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least and such payment  together with the aggregate amount of all other distributions after january   is less than the sum of of our consolidated net income for the period from october  to the end of the most recent quarter for which financial statements have been filed  plus of net cash proceeds received after october  as a contribution to our common equity capital or from the issuance or sale of certain securities  plus several other adjustments 
the amount allowed under this restriction was million at december  the revolving credit facility also restricts dividend payments unless  after giving effect to such payment  the availability under the line of credit equals or exceeds million 
none of the agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios  except that the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to when availability falls below million 
in addition  the senior notes indenture and the revolving credit facility restrict our ability to create liens  to engage in certain affiliate transactions and to engage in sale leaseback transactions 
our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future  which is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future

we periodically update the estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on our latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies applied in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when title and risk of loss passes to the customer upon delivery under executed customer purchase orders or contracts 
for export contracts  the title and risk of loss passes to customers at the time specified by each contract 
provisions for discounts  rebates and returns are provided for in the same period as the related sales are recorded 
long lived assets 
key estimates related to long lived assets include useful lives  recoverability of carrying values and existence of any retirement obligations and such estimates could be significantly modified 
the carrying values of long lived assets could be impaired by new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries and uncertainties associated with governmental actions 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and the operational performance of our businesses 
actual impairment losses incurred could vary significantly from amounts estimated 
additionally  future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that associated long lived assets of our businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from three to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
we defer the costs of major turnaround maintenance and repair activities and amortize the costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
in  we had a major turnaround at our calvert city facility and at one of our ethylene units in lake charles 
total costs deferred on these turnarounds were million 
there were no major turnarounds in and amortization in  and of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   capitalized turnaround costs  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million 
expensing turnaround costs would likely result in greater variability of our quarterly operating results and would adversely affect our financial position and results of operations 
additional information concerning long lived assets and related depreciation and amortization appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents long term employee benefit costs 
our costs for long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is our responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that represent the best estimates of those uncertainties 
it is also our responsibility to review those assumptions periodically and  if necessary  adjust the assumptions to reflect changes in economic or other factors 
accounting for employee retirement plans involves estimating the cost of benefits that are to be provided in the future and attempting to match  for each employee  that estimated cost to the period worked 
to accomplish this  we rely extensively on advice from actuaries  and assumptions are made about inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover and discount rates that ultimately impact amounts recorded 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k related to these retirement plans are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from these estimates 
assumed healthcare trend rates do not have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the healthcare plans because benefits for participants are capped at a fixed amount 
additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k 
inventories 
inventories primarily include product  materials and supplies 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
the use of other methods  such as lifo  could result in differing amounts being reported as inventories and cost of sales depending on price changes and sales turnover levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in our determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts  and consistent with our accounting policy  we estimate the amount of accounts receivable that we believe are unlikely to be collected and we record an expense of that amount 
estimating this amount requires us to analyze the financial strength of our customers  and  in our analysis  we combine the use of historical experience  our accounts receivable aged trial balance and specific collectibility analysis 
we review our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
balances over days past due and accounts determined by our analysis of financial strength of customers to be high risk are reviewed individually for collectibility 
by its nature  such an estimate is highly subjective and it is possible that the amount of accounts receivable that we are unable to collect may be different than the amount initially estimated 
income taxes 
the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded based upon temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes 
deferred tax expense or benefit is the result of changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period 
valuation allowances are recorded against deferred tax assets when it is considered more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
environmental and legal obligations 
we consult with various professionals to assist us in making estimates relating to environmental costs and legal proceedings 
we accrue an expense when we determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
while we believe that the amounts recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements related to these contingencies are based on the best estimates and judgments available  the actual outcomes could differ from our estimates 
additional information about certain legal proceedings and environmental matters appears in note to the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this form k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of our products and raw materials are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of our profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
we try to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
our strategies include ethylene product feedstock flexibility and moving downstream into the olefins and vinyls products where pricing is more stable 
we use derivative instruments in certain instances to reduce price volatility risk on feedstocks and products 
based on our open derivative positions at december   a hypothetical increase in the price of a mmbtu of natural gas would have increased our income before taxes by million  a hypothetical increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil would have decreased our income before taxes by million  a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of ethane would have increased our income before taxes by million and a hypothetical increase in the price of a gallon of benzene would have decreased our income before taxes by million 
additional information concerning derivative commodity instruments appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to fixed and variable rate debt 
at december   we had variable rate debt of million outstanding 
all of the debt outstanding under our tax exempt revenue bonds is at variable rates 
we do not currently hedge our variable interest rate debt  but we may do so in the future 
the interest rate for our variable rate debt of million as of december  was 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the average interest rate on our variable rate debt would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
also  at december   we had million of fixed rate debt 
we are subject to the risk of higher interest cost if and when this debt is refinanced 
if interest rates are higher at the time of refinancing  our annual interest expense would increase by approximately million
