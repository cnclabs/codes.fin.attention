item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources 
many of our directors  officers and principal shareholders have had and will continue to have banking transactions with the bank in the ordinary course of business 
any loans and commitments to lend included in such transactions are made in accordance with applicable law  on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other persons of similar creditworthiness  and on terms not involving more than the normal risks of collection or presenting other unfavorable features 
we are prohibited by the bhca  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting share of any company that is not a bank  bank holding company engaged in financial activities and from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to our subsidiary 
subject to the prior approval of the frb under the bhca as revised and expanded by the gramm leach bliley act of  we may engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that are deemed by the frb  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  to be financial in nature see financial services modernization legislation below 
under frb s regulations  a financial holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the frb s policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a financial holding company or bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a financial holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the frb to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the frb s regulations or both 
our securities are registered with the sec under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act 
we are therefore subject to the information  proxy solicitation  insider trading and other requirements and restrictions of the exchange act see item business  supervision and regulation  sarbanes oxley act of the bank 
table of contents the bank  as a nationally chartered bank  is subject to primary supervision  periodic examination  and regulation by the occ 
to a lesser extent  the bank is also subject to certain regulations promulgated by the frb 
if  as a result of an examination of the bank  the occ should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to the occ 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict the growth of the bank  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors and ultimately to terminate the bank s deposit insurance  which for a nationally chartered bank would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the state of california and the united states affect the operations of the bank 
state and federal statues and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including reserves against deposits  ownership of deposit accounts  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends  locations of banking centers and capital requirements 
furthermore  the bank is required to maintain certain levels of capital see item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  capital resources 
dividends and other transfer of funds dividends from the bank constitute our principal source of income 
we are a legal entity separate and distinct from the bank 
our ability to pay cash dividends is limited by california law 
under california law  our shareholders may receive dividends when and as declared by our board of directors out of funds legally available for such purpose 
with certain exceptions  a california corporation may not pay a dividend to its shareholders unless i its retained earnings equal at least the amount of the proposed dividend  or ii after giving effect to the dividend  the corporation s assets would equal at least times its liabilities and  for corporations with classified balance sheets  the current assets of the corporation would be at least equal to its current liabilities or  if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for those fiscal years  at least equal to times its current liabilities 
the occ has authority to prohibit the bank from engaging in activities that  in their opinion  constitute unsafe or unsound practices in conducting its business 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank in question and other factors  that the occ could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice 
furthermore  the occ has established guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by banks under their jurisdiction 
compliance with the standards set forth in such guidelines and the restrictions that are or may be imposed under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law could limit the amount of dividends which the bank may pay 
an insured depository institution is prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or  with certain limited exceptions  making capital distributions if after such transaction the institution would be undercapitalized 
the occ may impose similar limitations on the bank 
see item 
business  supervision and regulation  prompt corrective action 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on the following activities with the company or our affiliates any extensions of credit  the issuance of a guarantee or letter of credit  the purchase of  or investments in  stock or other securities  the taking of such securities as collateral for loans  and the purchase of assets 

table of contents such restrictions prevent us and other affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
furthermore  such secured loans to us or an affiliate and investments by the bank in us  or in an affiliate are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations  and such secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of the bank s capital and surplus as defined by federal regulations 
california law also imposes certain restriction with respect to transactions involving us and other controlling persons of the bank 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on the bank under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law 
see item 
business  supervision and regulation  prompt corrective action 
capital requirements the frb and the occ have established risk based minimum capital guidelines with respect to the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital by financial holding companies and national banking associations 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as commercial loans 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risked based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to average assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above minimum guidelines and ratios 
prompt corrective action the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within such categories 
fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive constraints on operations  management and capital distributions  depending on the category in which an institution is classified 
failure to meet the capital guidelines could also subject a banking institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized institution must develop a capital restoration plan 
at december   the bank exceeded all of the required ratios for classification as well capitalized 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized  may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
banking agencies have also adopted regulations which mandate that regulators take into consideration i concentrations of credit risk  ii interest rate risk when the interest rate sensitivity of an institution s assets does not match the sensitivity of its liabilities or its off balance sheet position  and iii risks from non traditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage those risks  when determining the adequacy of an institution s capital 
this evaluation will be made as a part of the institution s regular safety and soundness examination 
in addition  the banking agencies have amended their regulatory capital guidelines to incorporate a measure for market risk 
in accordance with the amended guidelines  any company with significant trading activities must incorporate a measure for market risk in its regulatory capital calculations 

table of contents in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the supervising agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses for violations of law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions vary commensurate with the severity of the violation 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset growth  v earnings  and vi compensation  fees and benefits 
in addition  the federal banking agencies have also adopted safety and soundness guidelines with respect to asset quality and earnings standards 
these guidelines provide six standards for establishing and maintaining a system to identify problem assets and prevent those assets from deteriorating 
under these standards  any insured depository institution should i conduct periodic asset quality reviews to identify problem assets  ii estimate the inherent losses in problem assets and establish reserves that are sufficient to absorb estimated losses  iii compare problem asset totals to capital  iv take appropriate corrective action to resolve problem assets  v consider the size and potential risks of material asset concentrations  and vi provide periodic asset quality reports with adequate information for management and the board of directors to assess the level of asset risk 
these guidelines also set forth standards for evaluating and monitoring earnings and for ensuring that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
in december  the occ  frb and fdic issued joint guidance relating to institutions concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
these agencies have observed that commercial real estate concentrations have been rising over the past several years and have reached levels that could create safety and soundness concerns in the event of a significant economic downturn 
while these agencies are not establishing a limit on the amount of commercial real estate lending that an institution may conduct  they have established a threshold which examiners may use to identify institutions with potential concentration risk 
any institution that has experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  has notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate or is approaching or exceeds the supervisory criteria may be identified for further examination 
premiums for deposit insurance our deposit accounts are insured by the deposit insurance fund dif  as administered by the fdic  up to the maximum permitted by law 
insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operation  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order  or condition imposed by the fdic or the institution s primary regulator 
the fdic charges an annual assessment for the insurance of deposits  which as of december   ranged from to basis points per of insured deposits  based on the risk a particular institution poses to its deposit insurance fund 
the risk classification is based on an institution s capital group and supervisory subgroup assignment 
an institution s risk category is based upon whether the institution is well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or less than adequately capitalized 
each insured depository institution is also assigned to one of the following supervisory subgroups subgroup a  b or c 
subgroup a institutions are financially sound institutions with few minor weaknesses  subgroup b institutions are institutions that demonstrate weaknesses which  if not corrected  could result in significant deterioration  and subgroup c institutions are institutions for which there is a substantial probability that the fdic will suffer a loss in connection with the institution unless effective action is taken to correct the areas of weakness 
insured institutions are not allowed to disclose their risk assessment classification and no assurance can be given as to what the future level of premiums will be 

table of contents on november   the fdic adopted final regulations establishing a risk based assessment system that will enable the fdic to more closely tie each financial institution s premiums to the risk it poses to the deposit insurance fund 
under the new risk based assessment system  which became effective january   the fdic will evaluate the risk of each financial institution based on three primary sources of information its supervisory rating  its financial ratios  and its long term debt issuer rating  if the institution has one 
the new rates for nearly all of the financial institution industry will vary between five and seven cents for every of domestic deposits 
at the same time  the fdic adopted final regulations designating the reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund during at of estimated insured deposits 
the community reinvestment act cra the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving lending  investing and other cra activities 
cra requires us to identify the communities served by the company s offices and to identify the types of credit and investments the company is prepared to extend within such communities including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
it also requires our regulators to assess our performance in meeting the credit needs of our community and to take such assessment into consideration in reviewing applications for mergers  acquisitions  relocation of existing branches  opening of new branches and other transactions 
a bank may be subject to substantial penalties and corrective measures for a violation of certain fair lending laws 
the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into consideration when regulating and supervising other banking activities 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is determined based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending  service and investment performance 
an unsatisfactory rating may be the basis for denying a merger application 
our latest cra examination was completed by the fdic 
we received an overall rating of satisfactory in complying with our cra obligations 
financial services modernization legislation in november  the gramm leach bliley act of the glb act was enacted 
the glb act repealed provisions of the glass steagall act which restricted the affiliation of federal reserve member banks with firms engaged principally in specified securities activities  and which restricted officer  director or employee interlocks between a member bank and any company or person primarily engaged in specified securities activities 
in addition  the glb act contains provisions that expressly preempt any state law restricting the establishment of financial affiliations  primarily related to insurance 
the general effect of the law is to establish a comprehensive framework to permit affiliations among commercial banks  insurance companies  securities firms and other financial service providers by revising and expanding the bhca framework to permit a holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities through a new entity known as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the frb  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the glb act provides that no company may acquire control of an insured savings association unless that company engages  and continues to engage  only in the financial activities permissible for a financial holding company  unless the company is grandfathered as a unitary savings and loan holding company 
the glb act grandfathers any company that was a unitary savings and loan holding company on may  or became a unitary savings and loan holding company pursuant to an application pending on that date 

table of contents the glb act also permits national banks to engage in expanded activities through the formation of financial subsidiaries 
a national bank may have a subsidiary engaged in any activity authorized for national banks directly or any financial activity  except for insurance underwriting  insurance investments  real estate investment or development  or merchant banking  which may only be conducted through a subsidiary of a financial holding company 
financial activities include all activities permitted under new sections of the bhca or permitted by regulation 
to the extent that the glb act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the glb act is intended to grant to community banks powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis and which unitary savings and loan holding companies already possess 
nevertheless  the glb act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that we face from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than we have 
regulation w transactions between a bank and its affiliates are governed by sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
the federal deposit insurance act applies sections a and b to insured nonmember banks in the same manner and to the same extent as if they were members of the federal reserve system 
the frb issued regulation w  which codifies prior regulations under sections a and b of the federal reserve act and provides interpretative guidance with respect to affiliate transactions 
affiliates of a bank include  among other entities  the bank s holding company and companies that are under common control with the bank 
the company is considered to be an affiliate of the bank 
in general  subject to certain specified exemptions  a bank or its subsidiaries are limited in their abilities to engage in covered transactions with affiliates to an amount equal to of the bank s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with any one affiliate  and to an amount equal to of the bank s capital and surplus  in the case of covered transactions with all affiliates 
in addition  a bank and its subsidiaries may engage in certain transactions only on terms and under circumstances that are substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank or its subsidiary  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies

the provisions of this standard are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year we currently use the amortization method to account for our servicing rights  and we expect to continue this practice after implementing sfas no

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement sfas no 
 a standard that provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
under the standard  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the standard clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
we will adopt sfas no

item a 
risk factors we are implementing a business strategy that may result in increased volatility of earnings 
our business strategy is focused on the expansion of commercial and entrepreneur business  commercial real estate  commercial real estate construction  and residential construction lending 
these types of lending activities  while potentially more profitable  are generally more sensitive to regional and local economic conditions  making loss levels more difficult to predict 
collateral evaluation and financial statement analysis in these types of loans requires a more detailed analysis at the time of loan underwriting and on an on going basis 
a decline in real estate values  particularly in california  would reduce the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans and increase the risk that we would incur losses if borrowers defaulted on our loans 
in addition  the repayment of commercial real estate loans is generally dependent  in large part  on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan 
also  loan balances for commercial real estate  commercial business and residential construction tract loans are typically larger than those for permanent single family and consumer loans 
accordingly  when there are defaults and losses on these types of loans  they are often larger on a per loan basis than those for permanent single family and consumer loans 
a secondary market for most types of commercial real estate and commercial business loans may not be readily liquid  so we may have less opportunity to mitigate credit risk by selling part or all of our interest in these loans 
our growth may not be managed successfully 
over the last six years  we have grown substantially from million of total assets and million of total deposits at december  to billion of total assets and billion of total deposits at december  we anticipate continued growth in our assets  the level of our deposits and the scale of our operations 
we may not be able to manage this growth effectively 
if we do not manage our growth effectively  we may not be able to achieve our business plan  and our business and prospects could be harmed 
while non performing loans have been minimal over the last few years  there are no assurances that this will continue into the future  especially in light of the current softening real estate market 
our growth subjects us to increased capital and operating commitments 
we must recruit experienced individuals that have the required skills that we need to grow our specialty lines of business 
as a result of the increase in our personnel  our expenses associated with salaries and other benefits have increased in recent periods 
the additional customer products  services  branch enhancements and the implementation of these items have placed and will continue to place a strain on our personnel  systems  and resources 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain and train qualified individuals to implement our business strategy in a timely  cost effective and efficient manner 
potential acquisitions may disrupt our business  dilute shareholder value and adversely affect our operating results 
in july  we completed a merger with rancho bank 
in conjunction with our strategic plan  we may continue to grow by acquiring banks  related businesses or banking centers of other banks that we believe provide a strategic fit with our business 
to the extent that we grow through acquisitions  we cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately or profitably manage this growth 
acquiring other banks  businesses or banking centers involves risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including 
table of contents potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of banks  businesses or banking centers we acquire  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the acquired banks  businesses or banking centers  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of banks  businesses or banking centers we acquire  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the banks  businesses or banking centers we acquire  difficulty in estimating the value of the banks  businesses or banking centers to be acquired  and potential changes in banking  tax laws  and or regulations that may affect the banks or businesses to be acquired 
our continued pace of growth may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available or may not be on terms acceptable to us when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
however  we may decide to raise additional capital to support continued growth  either internally or through acquisitions 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
our business strategy relies upon our chief executive officer and other key employees 
norman morales has been our president and chief executive officer since october mr 
morales is the chief architect of our strategic plan and has developed numerous aspects of our operating strategy and the implementation of such strategy depends heavily upon the active involvement of mr 
morales 
the loss of mr 
morales services could have a negative impact on the implementation and success of our business strategy 
mr 
morales is also a principal strategic recruiter for key management  on both the business generation and corporate support levels 
our success will also depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management  technical and marketing personnel to execute the strategic plan 
we will need to retain persons with diversified skills in order to manage our specialty lines of business 
competition for qualified personnel  especially those in management  sales and marketing  is intense 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain these persons 
our business is subject to various lending risks which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
residential real estate construction loans 
we make residential real estate construction loans to individuals and developers for the construction of residential properties 
these loans include single family luxury construction loans which are targeted at luxury homes located within the coastal communities and in other affluent areas of california 
we will originate these loans whether or not the property is under contract for sale 
residential real estate construction loans also include single family tract construction loans which target the construction of entry level units 
we have a significant amount of residential real estate construction loans in our loan portfolio  both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of our total loans 
at december   million or of our total loan portfolio consisted of residential real estate construction loans which exclude commercial real estate construction loans 

table of contents our construction loans are based upon estimates of costs and value associated with the completed project 
these estimates may be inaccurate 
construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent residential lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value ratio 
construction lending also typically involves higher loan principal amounts and is often concentrated with a small number of builders 
in addition  generally during the term of a construction loan  no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve 
construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment substantially dependent on the success of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or obtain permanent take out financing  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if our appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated  there may be inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and we may incur a loss 
our ability to continue to originate a significant amount of construction loans is dependent on the continued strength of the housing market in the california communities of los angeles  marin  orange  san diego and santa clara counties and in the inland empire region of southern california as well as elsewhere in california 
to the extent there is a decline in the demand for new housing in these communities  it is expected that the demand for construction loans would decline  our liquidity would substantially increase and our net income would be adversely affected 
commercial real estate loans 
we originate commercial real estate loans for individuals and businesses for various purposes which are secured by commercial real estate  which includes loans made to non profit organizations 
at december   million or of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans 
repayment of our commercial real estate loans may be dependent  in large part  on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan 
these loans may be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy generally 
for example  if the cash flow from the borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
in addition  many of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and contain large balloon payments upon maturity 
such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the balloon payment 
multifamily residential real estate loans 
our multifamily loans are subject to collateral risk similar to other real estate secured products 
while our primary lending markets have experienced strong demand for affordable housing  valuations have increased significantly over the past several years and could be negatively impacted by a decrease in investor demand 
at december   million or of our total loan portfolio consisted of multifamily residential real estate loans 
commercial business loans 
our commercial business loans generally consist of loans to small businesses  including sba loans 
at december   million or of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans 
repayment of our commercial business loans is often dependent on the cash flows of the borrower  which may be unpredictable  and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value 
our commercial business loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
most often  this collateral consists of accounts receivable  inventory or equipment 
credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of personal guarantees  if any exist 
as a result  in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers 
the collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 

table of contents our allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb possible losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
like all financial institutions  every loan we make carries a certain risk that it will not be repaid in accordance with its terms or that any collateral securing it will not be sufficient to assure repayment 
this risk is affected by  among other things cash flow of the borrower and or the project being financed  in the case of a collateralized loan  the changes and uncertainties as to the future value of the collateral  the credit history of a particular borrower  changes in economic and industry conditions  and the duration of the loan 
at december   our allowance for credit losses  which includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded commitments  as a percentage of gross loans was and our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans was 
regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for credit losses 
although we believe that our allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio and in unfunded commitments  we cannot predict these losses or whether the allowance will be adequate or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  prospects and profitability 
our business is subject to general economic risks that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in economic conditions  particularly an economic slowdown in california  could hurt our business 
our business is directly affected by political and market conditions  broad trends in industry and finance  legislative and regulatory changes  and changes in governmental monetary and fiscal policies and inflation  all of which are beyond our control 
deterioration in economic conditions  in particular an economic slowdown within california  could result in the following consequences  any of which could hurt our business materially loan delinquencies may increase  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  and collateral for loans made by us  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing a client s borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with our loans 
a downturn in the california real estate market could hurt our business 
our business activities and credit exposure are concentrated in california 
a downturn in the california real estate market could hurt our business because most of our loans are secured by real estate located within california 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate located in california 
if there is a significant decline in real estate values  especially in california  the collateral for our loans will provide less security 
as a result  our ability to recover on defaulted loans by selling the underlying real estate would be diminished  and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
real estate values in california could also be affected by  among other things  earthquakes and other natural disasters particular to california 
we may suffer losses in our loan portfolio despite our underwriting practices 

table of contents we seek to mitigate the risks inherent in our loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices 
these practices include analysis of a borrower s prior credit history  financial statements  tax returns and cash flow projections  valuation of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets 
although we believe that our underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans we make  we may incur losses on loans that meet our underwriting criteria  and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in our allowance for credit losses 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance 
like other financial institutions  our operating results are largely dependent on our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest earned on loans and securities and interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings 
our net interest income is impacted by changes in market rates of interest  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities  prepayments on our loans and securities and limits on increases in the rates of interest charged on our loans 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we cannot control or accurately predict changes in market rates of interest 
the following are some factors that may affect market interest rates  all of which are beyond our control see item  business  effect of governmental policies and recent legislation inflation  slow or stagnant economic growth or recession  unemployment  money supply and the monetary policies of the frb  international disorders  and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets 
sharp increases in interest rates could negatively affect our market value of equity 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
in addition  an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume  securities portfolio  and overall profitability 
although we attempt to manage our interest rate risk  we cannot be certain that we can minimize our interest rate risk 
our ability to service our debt  pay dividends  and otherwise pay our obligations as they come due is substantially dependent on capital distributions from the bank  and these distributions are subject to regulatory limits and other restrictions 
a substantial source of our income from which we service our debt and pay our obligations and dividends is the receipt of dividends from the bank 
the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of the bank  and other factors  that the applicable regulatory authorities could assert that payment of dividends or other payments  including payments to us  is an unsafe or unsound practice 
in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to us  we may not be able to service our debt  pay our obligations or pay dividends on our outstanding common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from the bank would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we face strong competition from other financial institutions  financial service companies and other organizations offering services similar to those we offer  which could hurt our business 

table of contents we face direct competition from a significant number of financial institutions  many with a statewide or regional presence  and in some cases a national presence  in both originating loans and attracting deposits 
competition in originating loans comes primarily from other banks  mortgage companies and consumer finance institutions that make loans in our primary market areas 
we also face substantial competition in attracting deposits from other banking institutions  money market and mutual funds  credit unions and other investment vehicles 
in addition  banks with larger capitalization and non bank financial institutions that are not governed by bank regulatory restrictions have large lending limits and are better able to serve the needs of larger customers 
many of these financial institutions are also significantly larger and have greater financial resources than us  have been in business for a long period of time and have established customer bases and name recognition 
we compete for loans principally on the basis of interest rates and loan fees  the types of loans which we originate  and the quality of service which we provide to borrowers 
our ability to attract and retain deposits requires that we provide customers with competitive investment opportunities with respect to rate of return  liquidity  risk and other factors 
to effectively compete  we may have to pay higher rates of interest to attract deposits  resulting in reduced profitability 
if we are not able to effectively compete in our market area  our profitability may be negatively affected and could limit our ability to pay dividends 
we continually encounter technological change  and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes  with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
we are subject to extensive regulation which could adversely affect our business 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance in all material respects with applicable federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws  rules and regulations applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change 
there are currently proposed various laws  rules and regulations that  if adopted  would impact our operations 
if these or any other laws  rules or regulations are adopted in the future  they could make compliance much more difficult or expensive  restrict our ability to originate or sell loans  further limit or restrict the amount of commissions  interest or other charges earned on loans we originate or sell  or otherwise materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  prospects or profitability 
distribution of assets  liabilities  and stockholders equity  interest rates and interest differential our earnings depend primarily upon the difference between the income we receive from our loan portfolio and investment securities and our cost of funds  principally interest paid on savings  time deposits and borrowings 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  and competitive factors 
in turn  these factors are influenced by general economic conditions and other constraints beyond our control  such as governmental economic and tax policies  general supply of money in the economy  governmental budgetary actions  and the actions of the frb see item business  effect of governmental policies and recent legislation

we are dedicated to relationship banking and the success of our customers  and we focus on the core values of creativity  integrity and flexibility 

table of contents we cater to the needs of small to mid size commercial businesses  entrepreneurs  retail community businesses  single family residence developers and builders  individuals  non profit organizations  and other local public and private organizations by offering specialty lending and depository solutions 
at december   we had billion in gross loans  of which are construction loans  are commercial real estate loans  are residential real estate loans  are commercial loans  and are consumer loans 
the majority of our loans are originated in our primary market areas throughout southern and northern california 
therefore  our loan portfolio s credit quality and value may be affected significantly by the california real estate market 
we attract deposits from the communities where we have established banking centers by offering competitive interest rate products and providing value added banking services 
we endeavor to obtain non interest bearing deposits in order to fund our lending activities 
our deposit portfolio at december  was comprised of in time certificate of deposits  in savings deposits which include money market  now  and savings deposits and in demand deposits 
we also strive to add value for our shareholders by optimizing our net interest margin and expanding the volume of our earning assets 
to optimize our net interest margin  we focus on loan yields and deposit costs  as net interest income comprises of our net revenues defined as net interest income before provision for loan losses plus other income 
in the past six years  we have grown significantly  however  our business is subject to various risks which are discussed in business  risk factors in item hereof 
management has implemented several strategies to manage risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity 
see business in item hereof 
based on historical results and current economic forecasts  we anticipate that we will continue to grow in the future 
however  due to risk factors that are beyond our control  actual results could differ from our estimates 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to provide a better understanding of the significant changes in trends relating to our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and interest rate sensitivity 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements 
the following information provides the operating highlights for merger completion on july   we completed a merger with rancho bank  pursuant to which rancho bank merged into the bank  with the bank as the surviving entity the merger 
the merger was completed pursuant to the agreement and plan of reorganization  which was signed on april  rancho bank operated four banking centers located in covina  san dimas  upland and walnut  which are located in san bernardino and los angeles counties of california 
we continue to operate all four banking centers 
the merger expands our footprint and allows us to deliver our products and services to the clients of the former rancho bank 
we believe the addition of the four banking centers also provides additional opportunities to expand our relationship banking efforts and strengthen our marketplace presence between the san gabriel valley and greater inland empire regions 
upon closing of the merger  we paid cash consideration of for each outstanding share of common stock of rancho bank 
the merger consideration resulted in an aggregate transaction value of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further transaction details 
during august  we successfully completed the integration of rancho bank s employees and customers into the bank  along with the conversion of systems  products and services 
the addition of accounts resulting from the merger with rancho bank reduced our overall funding costs 

table of contents we are able to offer the former rancho bank s client relationships our increased lending resources  while also affording these clients additional cash management services not previously available 
in addition  we have been able to develop new relationships through our product and service packages that rancho bank did not previously offer 
we incurred million in transitional expenses during the year ended december  relating to the completion of the merger and the integration of systems and personnel 
the costs were comprised primarily of transitional period bonuses  stay on bonuses  and employee salaries 
bank charter conversion in december  we determined that a national banking association charter would be better aligned with the bank s strategic plans  and therefore submitted an application to the occ to convert the bank s existing charter to a national banking association charter 
in addition to providing greater flexibility for expansion into new markets and product lines  we believe that a national banking association charter will provide more consistency in the applicability of laws and regulations  as the bank would be supervised by one bank regulatory agency 
on may   the occ approved the bank s application to convert to a national banking association 
the conversion became effective on may   and the bank s name was changed from vineyard bank to vineyard bank  national association 
under the previous california charter  the bank operated under the supervision of the dfi and the fdic 
upon conversion to the national banking association charter  the bank began operating under the supervision of the occ 
financial holding company designation in september  the frb approved our request to change our designation from a bank holding company to a financial holding company 
in addition to our current banking activities  this new designation will allow us to engage in activities such as insurance  financial advisory services  and other activities deemed by the frb to be financial in nature 
we believe that this new designation will provide more flexibility for expansion into new markets and product lines as we examine future opportunities for growth while building on our current strategic initiatives and plans 
registered direct offering on may   we completed the sale of million of our common stock in a registered direct offering  through which million shares were sold through a prospectus supplement to our shelf registration statement 
our shelf registration statement  which was filed with the sec in august  allows us to offer and sell million in debt and or equity securities  the terms of which will be established at the time of the offering by means of a written prospectus or prospectus supplement 
as of december   there was million in debt and equity securities available for issuance through the shelf registration statement 
the shares were sold to three accredited institutional investors with rbc capital markets corporation acting as sole placement agent for the transaction 
we used the proceeds of this transaction to support the bank s growth  payoff outstanding debt  fund the merger with rancho bank and for general corporate purposes 
junior subordinated debentures on may   we established a wholly owned subsidiary  vineyard statutory trust xi trust xi  which issued million in trust preferred securities to preferred investors 
we simultaneously issued million of junior subordinated debentures to trust xi 

table of contents the issuance of these debentures  with an initial effective after tax cost of capital of less than  allowed us to efficiently access growth capital 
together with the common stock issuance of million completed two weeks prior to this transaction  we raised million to support our internal growth  as well as the merger with rancho bank 
new banking center and loan production offices in conjunction with our strategic initiative to expand further into northern california  we converted our lpo in san rafael into a full service banking center in march  and we will focus on generating commercial and business banking  private banking and entrepreneurial services  cash management and community banking services 
to further the reach of our northern california operations  we opened a lpo in monterey in july and a lpo in palo alto in february we also broadened our market reach into ventura county of california  with the opening of a lpo in westlake village in february we will focus on the origination of high end single family luxury construction loans at the westlake village and palo alto lpos
