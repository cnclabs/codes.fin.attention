in january  amvac acquired certain assets associated with the evital g cranberry herbicide business conducted in the united states from syngenta 
in july  amvac acquired from flowserve us inc flowserve  all or substantially all of its assets associated with the smartbox closed delivery system 
the smartbox system electronically dispenses granular crop protection products  replacing older technology that utilizes mechanically driven sprockets and chains 
the state of the art smartbox technology allows farmers to apply crop protection products accurately and efficiently while avoiding contact with the product 
the computer controller enables farmers to monitor and change application rates while planting and provides the farmers with a permanent record of application 
initially the smartbox system was developed by flowserve in partnership with ei dupont de nemours and company dupont and zeneca  inc which partnership commenced in at the same time it acquired certain assets associated with the fortress corn soil insecticide business from dupont in  amvac assumed dupont s smartbox partnership interest 
thereafter  zeneca  inc abandoned its smartbox partnership interest 
in  amvac sold its fortress g active ingredient chlorethoxyfoxs corn soil insecticide to the american farmer in the smartbox system 
later that year  amvac secured exclusive marketing rights in the us bayer cropscience s aztec g corn soil insecticide which also can be applied through the smartbox system 
by offering both products  amvac provides farmers a choice of two different chemistries to apply through the smartbox system 
this allows farmers to rotate products from year to year  thereby preventing insects from building resistance to any one specific product 
amvac is currently looking at utilizing this system for other crops where the safety features of the system would provide an important benefit 
in july  amvac acquired from syngenta all us environmental protection agency epa end use product registrations and data support as well as a license to the ambush wp trademark wettable powder formulation in the united states

bayer markets a product under its trademark def which is similar to folex  and continues to sell def following its acquisition of aventis 
seasonality the agricultural chemical industry in general is cyclical in nature 
the demand for amvac s products tends to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage  however  does not necessarily follow calendar dates  but more closely follows varying growing seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
backlog amvac does not believe that backlog is a significant factor in its business 
amvac primarily sells its products on the basis of purchase orders  although it has entered into requirements contracts with certain customers

competition in amvac s marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of such competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources than amvac 
amvac s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products and expand its product lines and customer base 
amvac competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  its price and the technical service and support given to its customers 
the inability of amvac to effectively compete in several of amvac s principal products would have a material adverse effect on amvac s results of operations 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
amvac has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets which are no longer of strong focus to larger companies 
these markets are small by nature  require significant and intensive management input  ongoing product research  and are near product maturity 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand  and larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such niches as is evidenced by amvac s successful acquisitions of certain product lines 
intellectual property amvac s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
although amvac considers that  in the aggregate  its trademarks  licenses  and patents constitute a valuable asset  it does not regard its business as being materially dependent upon any single or several trademarks  licenses  or patents 
epa registrations amvac s products also receive protection afforded by the effect of the fifra legislation that makes it unlawful to sell any pesticide in the united states unless such pesticide has first been registered by the epa as well as under similar state laws 
substantially all of amvac s products are subject to epa registration and re registration requirements and are conditionally registered in accordance with fifra 
this licensing by epa is based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when it is used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of amvac s products are used require a registration by that specific state before it can be marketed or used in that state 
state registrations are renewed annually  as appropriate 
the epa and state agencies have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on registered products sold by amvac 
amvac  on its own behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  has furnished  and is currently furnishing  certain required data relative to specific products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement results in operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
amvac expensed   and  during  and 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries respectively  related to gathering this information 
based on facts known today  amvac estimates it will spend approximately  in because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by the regulatory authorities 
additionally  while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests studies be repeated 
amvac expenses these costs on an as incurred basis 
see also part ii  item of this annual report for discussions pertaining to research and development expenses 
raw materials amvac utilizes numerous firms as well as internal sources to supply the various raw materials and components used by amvac in manufacturing its products 
many of these materials are readily available from domestic sources 
in those instances where there is a single source of supply or where the source is not domestic  amvac seeks to secure its supply by either long term arrangements or advance purchases from its suppliers 
amvac believes that it is considered to be a valued customer to such sole source suppliers 
recent increases in energy costs are expected to have an adverse impact on the company  although the ultimate impact cannot be measured at this time 
environmental during  amvac continued activities to address environmental issues associated with its facility the facility in commerce  california 
in march  the california environmental protection agency department of toxic substances control dtsc accepted the facility into its expedited remedial action program erap 
under this program  the facility must prepare and implement an environmental investigation plan 
depending on the findings of the investigation  the facility may also be required to develop and implement remedial measures to address any historical environmental impairment 
the environmental investigation and any remediation activities related to ten underground storage tanks at the facility  which had been closed in  will also be addressed by amvac under erap 
soil and groundwater characterization activities began in december in accordance with the site investigation plan that was approved by the dtsc 
additional activities were conducted from to with oversight provided by the dtsc 
additional investigation is planned over the next year under the oversight of the dtsc 
potential remediation activities may be initiated in or these investigation and potential remediation activities are required at all facilities that currently have  or in the past had  hazardous waste storage permits 
because amvac previously held a hazardous waste management permit  amvac is subject to these requirements 
it is uncertain whether the cost associated with the potential remediation activities will have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
amvac is subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety at the commerce  california and axis  alabama facilities 
amvac continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have an impact on amvac s operations 
amvac expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with the governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
wherever feasible  amvac recovers raw materials and increases product yield in order to partially offset increasing pollution abatement costs 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company is committed to a long term environmental protection program that reduces emissions of hazardous materials into the environment  as well as to the remediation of identified existing environmental concerns 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations 
as part of its continuing environmental program  except as disclosed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this annual report  the company has been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on its business 
employees as of march   the company employed approximately persons 
amvac  on an ongoing basis  due to the seasonality of its business  uses temporary contract personnel to perform certain duties primarily related to packaging of its products 
the company believes it is cost beneficial to employ temporary contract personnel 
none of the company s employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement 
the company believes it maintains positive relations with its employees

the operating results of this operation were not material to the company s total operating results for the years ended december   and the company classifies as export sales all products bearing foreign labeling shipped to a foreign destination 
export sales percentage of net sales risk management the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk 
management believes its facilities and equipment are adequately insured against loss from usual business risks 
the company has purchased claims made products liability insurance 
there can be no assurance  however  that such product liability coverage insurance will continue to be available to the company  or if available  that it will be provided at an economical cost to the company

item a 
risk factors risk factors the company s business may be adversely affected by cyclical and seasonal effects 
the chemical industry in general is cyclical and demands for its products tend to be slightly seasonal 
seasonal usage follows varying agricultural seasonal patterns  weather conditions and weather related pressure from pests  and customer marketing programs and requirements 
weather patterns can have an impact on the company s operations 
the end user of some of its products may  because of weather patterns  delay or intermittently disrupt field work during the planting season which may result in a reduction of the use of some products and therefore may reduce our revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will adequately address any adverse seasonal effects 
the industry in which the company does business is extremely competitive and its business may suffer if the company is unable to compete effectively 
generally  the treatment against pests of any kind is broad in scope  there being more than one way or one product for treatment  eradication  or suppression 
the company faces competition from many domestic and foreign manufacturers  marketers and distributors participating in its marketplace 
competition in the 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries marketplace is based primarily on efficacy  price  safety and ease of application 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and technical resources 
the company s ability to compete depends on its ability to develop additional applications for its current products  and to expand its product lines and customer base 
the company competes principally on the basis of the quality of its products  and the technical service and support given to its customers 
there can be no assurance that the company will compete successfully with existing competitors or with any new competitors 
the company faces competition in certain markets from manufacturers of genetically modified seeds 
the company faces competition from larger chemical companies that market genetically modified gmo seeds in certain of the crop protection sectors in which the company competes  particularly that of corn 
to the extent that growers in these markets embrace the use of gmo seeds  such growers may reduce their use of pesticides sold by the company 
there is no guarantee that the company will maintain its market share or pricing levels in sectors that are subject to competition from gmo seed marketers 
the distribution and sale of the company s products are subject to prior governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation 
the company s products are subject to laws administered by federal  state and foreign governments  including regulations requiring registration  approval and labeling of its products 
the labeling requirements restrict the use of and type of application for our products 
more stringent restrictions could make our products less desirable  which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
substantially all of the company s products are subject to the epa registration and re registration requirements  and are conditionally registered in accordance with the fifra 
such registration requirements are based  among other things  on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions 
all states where any of the company s products are used also require registration before they can be marketed or used in that state 
governmental regulatory authorities have required  and may require in the future  that certain scientific data requirements be performed on the company s products 
the company  on its behalf and in joint efforts with other registrants  have and are currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products 
under fifra  the federal government requires registrants to submit a wide range of scientific data to support us registrations 
this requirement has significantly increased the company s operating expenses in such areas as testing and the production of new products 
the company expects such increases to continue in the future 
because scientific analyses are constantly improving  it cannot be determined with certainty whether or not new or additional tests may be required by regulatory authorities 
responding to such requirements may cause delays in the sales of our products which delays would adversely affect our profitability 
while fifra good laboratory practice standards specify the minimum practices and procedures which must be followed in order to ensure the quality and integrity of data related to these tests submitted to the us epa  there can be no assurance the epa will not request certain tests or studies be repeated 
in addition  more stringent legislation or requirements may be imposed in the future 
the company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis  if at all  or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance 
the company faces risks related to acquisitions of product lines 
the company has expanded and intends to continue to expand its operations through the acquisition of additional product lines from these larger competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to identify  acquire or profitably manage additional product lines  or successfully integrate any acquired product lines without substantial expenses  delays or other operational or financial problems 
there is an increasing trend in selling mature product lines through a competitive bid process 
as a result  we may not be the successful 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries bidder for a desirable product  or  if successful  we may pay a higher price for such product than if there was no competitive bid process 
further  acquisitions may involve a number of special risks or effects  including diversion of management s attention  failure to retain key acquired personnel  unanticipated events or circumstances  minimum purchase quantities  legal liabilities and amortization of acquired intangible assets and other one time or ongoing acquisition related expenses 
some or all of these special risks or effects could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
client satisfaction or performance problems associated with a business or product line could have a material adverse impact on the company s reputation 
in addition  there can be no assurance that acquired product lines  if any  will achieve anticipated revenues and earnings 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to develop additional applications for its products  and to expand its product lines and customer base 
the company has grown primarily by a strategy of acquiring mature product lines from larger competitors and expanding sales of these products based on new applications and new users 
the company s success will depend  in part  on its ability to develop additional applications for its products  and to expand its product lines and customer base in a highly competitive market 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in adequately addressing these development needs on a timely basis or that  if these developments are addressed  the company will be successful in the marketplace 
in addition  there can be no assurance that products or technologies eg  genetic engineering developed by others will not render the company s products noncompetitive or obsolete  which would have a material adverse effect on its financial and operating results 
many of the mature product lines the company has acquired from larger competitors were divested as a result of a mergers involving such large competitors 
if the company is unable to successfully position itself in smaller niche markets  its business may be materially adversely affected 
the company has attempted to position itself in smaller niche markets that have been or are being abandoned by larger chemical companies 
these types of markets tend not to attract larger chemical companies due to the smaller volume demand 
as a result  larger chemical companies have been divesting themselves of products that fall into such smaller niche markets 
these smaller niche markets require significant and intensive management input and ongoing product research and are near product maturity 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these smaller niche markets or  if it is successful in one or more niche markets  that it will continue to be successful in such niche markets 
the manufacturing of the company s products is subject to governmental regulations 
the company operates two manufacturing facilities one in los angeles  california and the other in axis  alabama the facilities 
the facilities operate under the terms and conditions imposed by required licenses and permits by state and local authorities 
the manufacturing of key ingredients for the company s products occurs at the facilities 
an inability to renew or maintain a license or permit or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits could impede the company s access to key ingredients and increase the cost of production  which  in turn  would materially and adversely affect the company s ability to provide its products in a timely and affordable manner 
the company may be subject to environmental liabilities 
the company  its facilities and its products are subject to numerous federal and state laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee health and safety 
the company continually adapts 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of the various regulatory agencies 
the us epa and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that could have a significant impact on the company s operations 
the company expends substantial funds to minimize the discharge of materials in the environment and to comply with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment 
federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of the various laws and governmental regulations  and could  among other things  impose liability on the company for cleaning up the damage resulting from release of pesticides and other agents into the environment 
the company s use of hazardous materials exposes it to potential liabilities 
the company s development and manufacturing of chemical products involve the controlled use of hazardous materials 
while the company continually adapts its manufacturing process to the environmental control standards of regulatory authorities  it cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials 
in the event of such contamination or injury  the company may be held liable for significant damages or fines 
in the event that such damages or fines are assessed  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
the company s business may give rise to product liability claims not covered by insurance or indemnity agreements 
the manufacturing  marketing  distribution and use of chemical products involve substantial risk of product liability claims 
a successful product liability claim which is not insured may require the company to pay substantial amounts of damages 
in the event that such damages are paid  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial and operating results 
adverse results in pending legal and regulatory proceedings could have adverse effects on the company s business 
the company is currently  and may from time to time be  involved in legal and regulatory proceedings 
the results of litigation and such proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has and will continue to expend resources and incur expenses in connection with these proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these proceedings 
while the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk  an adverse determination in one or more of these proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results 
the company relies on intellectual property which it may be unable to protect  or may be found to infringe the rights of others 
the company s proprietary product formulations are protected  to the extent possible  as trade secrets and  to a lesser extent  by patents and trademarks 
most of the mature products that the company has acquired which were patented are currently off patent because the patent has expired 
the company can provide no assurance that the way it protects its proprietary rights will be adequate or that its competitors will not independently develop similar or competing products 
further  the company can provide no assurance that its is not infringing other parties rights 
any claims could require the company to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property  or acquire licenses to the intellectual property which is the subject of asserted infringement 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries the company relies on key executives in large part for its success 
the company s success is highly dependent upon the efforts and abilities of its executive officers  particularly eric g 
wintemute  its president and chief executive officer 
although mr 
wintemute has entered into an employment agreement with the company  this does not guarantee that he will continue his employment 
the loss of the services of mr 
wintemute or other executive officers could have a material adverse effect upon its financial and operating results 
concentration of ownership among the company s co chairmen of the board of directors may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions 
as of march   herbert a 
kraft and glenn a 
wintemute  the company s co chairmen of the board of directors  beneficially owned approximately and  respectively  of the company s common stock 
these stockholders as a group will be able to influence substantially the company s board of directors and thus its management and affairs 
if acting together  they would be able to influence most matters requiring the approval by the company s stockholders  including the election of directors  any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets and any other significant corporate transaction 
the concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control if opposed by these stockholders irrespective of whether the proposed transaction is at a premium price or otherwise beneficial to the company s stockholders as a whole 
the company is dependent on a limited number of customers  which makes us vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers 
in  three customers accounted for of the company s sales 
the company s future prospects will depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers 
the company cannot guarantee that our current significant customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels 
the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s stock price may be volatile  and an investment in the company s stock could decline in value 
the market prices for securities of companies in the company s industry have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future 
often this volatility is unrelated to operating performance of a company 
the company s business may be adversely affected by terrorist activities 
the company s business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce 
recently  in response to terrorists activities and threats aimed at the united states  transportation  mail  financial and other services have been slowed or stopped altogether 
further delays or stoppages in transportation  mail  financial or other services could have a material adverse effect on the business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  the company may experience an increase in operating costs  such as costs for transportation  insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential activities 
the company may also experience delays in receiving payments from counterparties that have been affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities 
the us economy in general is being adversely affected by the terrorist activities and potential activities and any economic downturn could adversely impact results of operations  impair the ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect the ability to grow the business 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
complying with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new sec regulations and changes to the new york stock exchange rules  will require the company to expend significant resources 
the company is committed to maintaining the highest standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  the company will continue to invest necessary resources to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards  and this investment may result in increased expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities 
the impact of fas r may require recognition of significant financial expense for stock options 
fas r  as published by the financial accounting standards board  will require the company  as a public company  to recognize in its financial statements an expense for stock options that are unvested and become exercisable after december  and for any new grants issued subsequent to january  in  the company recognized a pre tax expense related to this requirement

dbcp litigation amvac and or the company have been named or otherwise implicated in a number of lawsuits concerning injuries allegedly arising from either contamination of water supplies or personal exposure to  dibromo chloropropane dbcp 
a summary of these actions follows a 
hawaii matters amvac and the company were served with complaints in february the actions were filed in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii entitled board of water supply of the county of maui v 
shell oil co  et 
al 
the suit named as defendants the company  amvac  shell oil company  the dow chemical company  occidental chemical company  occidental petroleum corporation  occidental chemical corporation  and brewer environmental industry  inc maui pineapple company was joined as a cross defendant 
the complaint alleged that between two and four of the board s wells had been contaminated with dbcp in excess of the maximum contaminant level mcl 
in addition  the board of water supply contended that future wells may exceed the mcl level and would need remediation 
on august   a global settlement was reached  which included the remediation of the existing contaminated wells in addition to the installation of filtration devices on other wells for the next forty years on the island of maui 
the cash settlement was three million dollars  of which amvac s and the company s portion was five hundred thousand dollars 
the settlement agreement obligates the defendants to pay for the installation of filtration devices on other wells that become contaminated later and for the ongoing operation and maintenance of the filtration devices for up to forty years 
the annual costs of operation and maintenance per well is estimated to be approximately sixty nine thousand dollars  to be adjusted annually by the consumer price index 
the obligations of the defendants under this agreement are secured by a twenty million dollar letter of credit obtained by dow chemical 
in connection with the settlement  in october  amvac paid for a share of a permanent filtration system in the amount of  in october  amvac was served with a complaint s in which it was named as a defendant  filed in the circuit court  first circuit  state of hawaii and in the circuit court of the second circuit  state of hawaii

other named defendants are dole food co  dole fresh fruit  dole fresh fruit international  pineapple growers association of hawaii  shell oil company  dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  standard fruit company  standard fruit steamship  standard fruit company de costa rica  standard fruit company de honduras  chiquita brands  chiquita brands international  martrop trading corporation  and del monte fresh produce 
american vanguard corporation has not been sued in these actions 
the ten named plaintiffs are citizens of four countries guatemala  costa rica  panama  and ecuador 
punitive damages are sought against each defendant 
the plaintiffs were banana workers and allege that they were exposed to dbcp in applying the product in their native countries 
the case was also filed as a class action on behalf of other workers so exposed in these four countries 
the plaintiffs allege sterility and other injuries 
the suits were removed to federal court and for the last several years  the focus of the case has been on procedural issues  including the dismissal of the case based on the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
this doctrine would require the plaintiffs to pursue their claims in their native countries 
on april   the united states supreme court issued a decision on the procedural posture of the case  holding there was no jurisdiction in federal court and remanded the case to state court 
starting in early  there had been no activity in the case for about two years 
however  a status conference was held on june  at the request of the plaintiffs attorneys  who expressed a desire to pursue the class action aspect or add other individuals 
plaintiffs counsel now claims that his class members will include two pineapple workers in hawaii who have testicular cancer  and he also claims to have class members from mainland us and other countries 
on september   the court ordered the transfer of venue of the maui action from maui county to oahu  where we expect the duplicate suit to be dismissed 
other preliminary issues will be class certification and or the addition of class members as individual defendants 
written discovery to defendants was conducted on venue related issues 
further  the plaintiffs attorneys reported that the ten plaintiffs filed suit in their home countries in  based on the prior order of forum non conveniens  alleging in excess of two million united states dollars  per plaintiff 
the suit in guatemala was served on amvac in march  but no defendant has been required to answer 
suits in the other countries have not been served 
amvac has engaged local attorneys in the countries to defend these foreign suits 
no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
without such discovery  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs was exposed to amvac brand dbcp or what statute of limitation defenses may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
however  it is too early to provide an assessment as to the probability of an unfavorable outcome in these matters 
b 
mississippi matters in may  amvac was served with five complaints in which it is named as a defendant 
these complaints were filed by the same attorneys representing the patrickson plaintiffs in hawaii 
the complaints are brought by plaintiffs edgar arroyo gonzalez  eulogio garzon larreategui  valentinvaldez  amilcar belteton rivera  and carlos nicanor espinola e against one or more of the following other named defendants coahoma chemical co 
inc  shell oil company  dow chemical co  occidental chemical co  standard fruit co  standard fruit and steamship co  dole food co  inc  dole fresh fruit co  chiquita brands  inc  chiquita brands international  inc 
and del monte fresh produce  na the cases were filed in the circuit court of harrison county  first judicial district of mississippi 
each case alleged damages sustained from injuries caused by plaintiffs who are former banana workers and citizens of a central american country exposure to dbcp while applying the product in their native countries 
these cases were removed to us district court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
the federal court granted defense motions to dismiss in each case pursuant to the doctrine of forum non conveniens 
on january   the court issued an unpublished 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries decision  finding that there was jurisdiction in federal court  but remanded just one case espinola back to the trial court to determine if a stipulation which limited the plaintiff s recovery to fifty thousand dollars  was binding 
if the stipulation is binding  that case will be remanded to state court 
if the stipulation is not binding  that case will be dismissed along with the others  requiring the plaintiffs to litigate in their native countries 
the federal court then ordered remand to state court 
no activity has taken place on this matter since without discovery  it is unknown whether any of the plaintiffs were exposed to the company s product or what defenses may apply 
amvac intends to contest the cases vigorously 
it is too early to provide an evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome in this case 
c 
louisiana matters in november  amvac was served with three complaints filed in the th judicial district court for the parish of st 
charles  state of louisiana entitled pedro rodrigues et 
al v 
amvac chemical corporation et 
al  andres puerto  et

amvac chemical corporation  et

amvac chemical corporation et 
al 
other named defendants are dow chemical company  occidental chemical corporation  shell oil company  standard fruit  dole food  chiquita brands  tela railroad company  compania palma tica  and del monte fresh produce 
american vanguard corporation is not named as a defendant 
these suits were filed in  but they were not served until november following a dismissal of most of the plaintiffs from the action in light of the fact that they had previously settled their claims in other actions  the complaints  with soriano as the lead case  allege personal injuries to about persons from ecuador  from costa rica  and from guatemala from alleged exposure to dbcp punitive damages are also sought 
with the united states supreme court holding there was no federal court jurisdiction in the patrickson case  the federal court judge remanded the cases to louisiana state court in june in state court  the three cases were assigned to two different judges 
in  a group of plaintiffs represented by attorney misko  who had been making claims solely against growers  settled with those growers and dismissed their claims against the company 
on november   the state court separated the cases handled by attorney scott hendler from the cases being pursed only against the growers handled by different counsel 
the pleadings are not yet finalized as to the number of plaintiffs in these suits 
as in many of the other banana worker s cases  no discovery has taken place on the individual claims of the plaintiffs 
thus  it is unknown as to how many of the plaintiffs claim exposure to amvac s product and whether their claims are barred by applicable statutes of limitation 
amvac intends to vigorously contest these cases 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
d 
nicaragua matters tellez et al v 
dole food company  inc et al on march   plaintiffs  all residents of nicaragua  filed suit in state court in los angeles county  california  claiming personal injuries from alleged exposure to dbcp while working on banana plantations in their home country 
the named defendants are dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  dow chemical company  and amvac chemical corporation 
american vanguard is not named as a defendant 
punitive damages are also sought against all defendants 
the plaintiffs claim personal injuries for sterility  reduced sperm counts  and other reproductive injuries 
they claim exposure from working on banana plantations in nicaragua from dermal contact with dbcp and inhalation of vapors 
the plaintiffs also claimed exposure to dbcp in groundwater that they ingested  but testing of wells in october did not reveal the presence of any dbcp contamination and this claim of exposure through groundwater is being dropped 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries amvac was served with the complaint on april  and filed an answer on may  on may   dow chemical removed the case from state court to the united states district court for the central district of california 
the case was subsequently remanded to state court 
on september   the plaintiffs were permitted to file an amended complaint that dropped seven plaintiffs and added others  so that there were a total of plaintiffs 
since that time  plaintiffs have been dismissed  four others who have not yet obtained us visas to come to the united states for their depositions  and one making a cancer related claim have been transferred to the mejia case listed below  reducing the total to the defendants have been taking depositions of the plaintiffs experts 
trial is presently scheduled for may   having recently been rescheduled due to the inability to complete depositions of the plaintiffs and defendants experts within the time lines in the case management order 
plaintiffs and defendants experts will have differing views at their depositions and at trial regarding what types and amounts of exposure to dbcp might cause sterility 
depositions of defense experts will take place primarily in march 
amvac contends that very few of these plaintiffs worked at a banana farm when its product could have been used 
amvac also disputes the nature and extent of the claimed injuries 
amvac intends to continue to vigorously contest this case 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time  as expert discovery is not yet complete 
however  this case  like the other pending banana workers suits  presents difficult issues of law and fact to all parties and has a potentially large exposure 
in all of these banana worker cases  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to avoid an adverse judgment or that the size of any such judgment will not have an adverse effect upon the company s financial performance 
if plaintiffs are successful  it is likely that other banana workers from nicaragua will file suit in california 
rodolfo mejia et al v 
dole food company  inc et al on september   the attorneys who also represent plaintiffs in tellez et al v 
dole food company et al filed an action on behalf of nicaraguan plaintiffs in the los angeles county superior court against dole food company  inc  dole fresh fruit company  standard fruit company  standard fruit and steamship company  the dow chemical company  and amvac chemical corporation 
the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs worked at various banana farms in nicaragua and were exposed to dbcp from to  suffering irreversible sterility or infertility 
the complaint seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages against each defendant 
the suit has been assigned to the same judge for case management as in the tellez matter 
plaintiffs have served a first amended complaint naming banana plantation workers in nicaragua as plaintiffs  including five plaintiffs who were transferred from the tellez action 
the mejia action has been designated as related to the tellez action has been stayed pending developments in the tellez action  except for the preliminary steps of collecting plaintiffs medical and employment records in nicaragua so that they are available for use once discovery gets underway 
discovery has not yet begun in this case 
it is too early to provide any evaluation of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome at this time 
suits filed in nicaragua the los angeles attorneys representing these workers in california have recently stated that they have as many as  clients in nicaragua 
thirteen of them are plaintiffs in the tellez suit and are plaintiffs in the mejia suit pending in the los angeles county superior court 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries in prior descriptions of pending litigation and other matters  several suits filed in nicaragua in january on behalf of banana workers claiming exposure to dbcp were mentioned 
it was reported that amvac had been named in these suits  but was not served with the complaints 
in may  two suits filed in nicaragua in were received that name amvac  the dow chemical company  dole food co  dole fresh fruit  and standard fruit company 
the two suits for personal injuries for sterility and reduced sperm counts have been filed on behalf of a total of banana workers flavio apolinar castillo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
and luis cristobal martinez suazo et al 
v 
amvac chemical corporation et al  no 
in december  amvac received six additional  similar lawsuits filed on behalf of a total of plaintiffs 
these plaintiffs each claim million in special and general damages and million in punitive damages 
amvac has retained an attorney in nicaragua and understands that the receipt of these eight suits constitutes first notice and an invitation to attend mediation 
all but one of these suits is based on nicaraguan public law issued in october that is directed solely at dbcp and requires the posting of a  bond  sets forth a lessened standard of proof to show that the claimed injuries are due to dbcp  and establishes an unreasonable amount of minimum compensation for injuries 
this law also provides that there is no statute of limitations 
on january   amvac was served with the flavio apolinar castillo and luis cristobal martinez suazo suits listed above 
in march  counsel in nicaragua filed objections to jurisdiction over amvac in these two cases 
amvac s local counsel reports that the court has not yet ruled on the objections to jurisdiction 
a review of court filings in chinandega  nicaragua  by local counsel has found suits filed pursuant to public law that name amvac and include approximately  plaintiffs 
however  only the two castillo and suazo cases have been served on amvac 
each of these plaintiffs claims million in special and general damages and million in punitive damages 
it is anticipated that the plaintiffs attorneys will continue to file additional actions on a monthly basis in nicaragua 
in an earlier round of suits brought in nicaragua against dow  shell  and standard fruit only  the nicaragua court issued judgments for million in december based on claims of banana workers  despite defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and the unconstitutionality of public law it has been reported that in  the united states district court in los angeles refused to enforce these judgments on the basis that the judgments did not properly name the defendants 
the us district court did not reach the issue of due process under public law an appeal to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit is pending 
amvac contends that the nicaragua courts do not have jurisdiction over it and that public law violates international due process of law 
amvac intends to contest personal jurisdiction and demand under law that the claims be litigated in the united states 
thus far  it appears that the nicaraguan courts have denied all requests of other defendants under law that allow the defendants the option of consenting to jurisdiction in the united states 
it is not presently known as to how many of these plaintiffs actually claim exposure to dbcp at the time amvac s product was allegedly used nor is there any verification of the claimed injuries 
based on the precedent of the earlier suits in nicaragua  it would appear likely that the nicaragua courts will  over the defendants objections  enter multi million dollar judgments for the plaintiffs and against all defendants in these cases 
one such judgment was entered in august for million for plaintiffs against dole food and other entities 
it has also been reported that on december   the nicaraguan court rendered a judgment for million against dow  shell  occidental  and standard fruit for some plaintiffs 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries e 
ivory coast cases on october   amvac was served with seven suits filed in the los angeles county superior court and one suit in the united states district court in los angeles that include a total of residents of the ivory coast as plaintiffs 
each plaintiff claims bodily injuries from exposure to dbcp while residing or working on banana or pineapple plantations in that country from the s to the present 
the suits name amvac  dow chemical  shell oil company  and dole food as defendants 
all these suits also seek punitive damages and the action filed in federal court alleges a claim under the alien tort claims act  alleging that the sale and use of dbcp amounted to genocide in the ivory coast 
amvac does not believe that it sold any dbcp into the ivory coast at any time and intends to defend these cases vigorously 
discovery has not yet begun in these cases  and it is too early to provide any evaluation as to the probability of an unfavorable outcome 
on november   dow and shell removed the seven state court cases to federal court  alleging that the naming of amvac and the dole entities amounted to a fraudulent joinder of those defendants by plaintiffs to defeat federal jurisdiction 
however  the federal court has remanded all of those cases on its own motion back to state court 
on december  amvac answered the alien tort claims act case 
a defense motion for judgment on the pleadings in the alien tort claims act case in federal court is pending for a hearing on march  f

cn and subsequently removed to the united states district court for the northern district of georgia no 
cv cap  in which a class of plaintiffs seek damages  including punitive damages  in an unspecified amount for personal injuries and diminution in property value allegedly arising from the airborne release of propyl mercaptan and ethoprop from a waste treatment facility operated by psc recovery services psc in fairburn  georgia 
plaintiffs  residents living in the vicinity of the psc plant  allege trespass  nuisance and negligence on behalf of defendants in handling  storing and treating waste which was generated by amvac s axis  alabama facility 
in addition  in january  the alabama department of environmental management issued a proposed administrative order citing amvac for  among other things  storing rejected washwater which is the subject of the mclendon case in violation of applicable regulations regarding the storage of hazardous materials 
the company is negotiating a consent order with adem which it expects to complete in the near future 
it is too early in the mclendon litigation to make an assessment of the likelihood of there being an adverse judgment against amvac or whether such judgment could have an adverse effect upon the company s financial performance 
amvac plans to defend the action vigorously 
on march   amvac and avd accepted tender of defense and indemnity from valent usa corporation valent with respect to an action entitled victoria espinoza  et al 
v 
does  et al  including valent usa corporation filed in the los angeles superior court no 
bc in march  in which plaintiff  who worked as a temporary employee intermittently in the packaging department at one of amvac s facilities between august and august  seeks damages for injuries  specifically acute myelogenous leukemia  allegedly arising from exposure to chemical products at that amvac facility 
the defense and 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries indemnity obligations arise from a toll manufacturing and supply agreement dated in september between amvac and valent s predecessor  and an asset purchase agreement dated in june between amvac and valent by which the former purchased the dibrom product line from the latter 
the company believes that the action is without merit and plans to defend it vigorously 
although the punitive damages claim has been dismissed from the action  however  there is no guarantee that the company will be able to avoid an adverse judgment or that the size of any such judgment will not have an adverse effect upon the company s financial performance 
trial is currently scheduled for july  other the company may be  from time to time  involved in other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of its business 
the results of litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
the company has and will continue to expend resources and incur expenses in connection with these proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in these proceedings 
while the company continually evaluates insurance levels for product liability  property damage and other potential areas of risk  an adverse determination in one or more of these proceedings could subject the company to significant liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and operating results

 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
upon adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the recognition and measurement provisions of fin  if any  shall be reflected as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
fin requires that subsequent to initial adoption a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
currently  we record such changes in judgment  including audit settlements  as a component of the company s income tax provision 
thus  the company s reported quarterly income tax rate may become more volatile upon adoption of fin this change will not impact the manner in which we record income tax expense on an annual basis

foreign exchange management does not believe that the fluctuation in the value of the dollar in relation to the currencies of its customers in the last three fiscal years has adversely affected the company s ability to sell products at agreed upon prices denominated in us dollars 
no assurance can be given  however  that adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations will not occur in the future 
should adverse currency exchange rate fluctuations occur in geographies where the company sells exports its products  management is not certain such fluctuations will materially impact the company s operating results 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations during the past three years 
critical accounting policies certain of the company s policies require the application of judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  commonly accepted industry practices and other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s critical accounting polices and estimates include revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts revenue from sales is recognized at the time title and the risks of ownership passes 
this is when the customer has made the fixed commitment to purchase the goods  the products are shipped per the customers instructions  the sales price is determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 

table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required 
inventories the company values its inventories at lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out fifo method  including material  labor and factory overhead 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the cost of the inventory 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 
long lived assets the carrying value of long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
measurement of the impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
generally  fair value will be determined using valuation techniques such as the present value of expected future cash flows 
property  plant and equipment and depreciation property  plant and equipment includes the cost of land  buildings  machinery and equipment  office furniture and fixtures  automobiles  and construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment 
interest costs related to significant construction projects are capitalized at the company s weighted average cost of capital 
expenditures for maintenance and minor repairs are expensed as incurred 
when property or equipment is sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the respective accounts and the gain or loss realized on disposition is reflected in earnings 
all plant and equipment is depreciated using the straight line method  utilizing estimated useful property lives 
building lives range from to years  machinery and equipment lives range from to years  office furniture and fixture lives range from to years  automobile lives range from to years  construction projects and significant improvements to existing plant and equipment lives range from to years when placed in service 
foreign currency translation assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries  where the local currency is the functional currency  have been translated at year end exchange rates and profit and loss accounts have been translated using weighted average yearly exchange rates

the estimated useful life of an identifiable intangible asset to the company is based upon a number of factors including the effects of 
table of contents american vanguard corporation and subsidiaries demand  competition  and expected changes in the marketability of the company s products 
the company tests identifiable intangible assets for impairment at least annually  relying on a number of factors including operating results  business plans and future cash flows 
identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment using a process similar to that used to evaluate elements of property 
the impairment test for identifiable intangible assets not subject to amortization consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss  if any  is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis  which requires the company to estimate the future cash flows anticipated to be generated by the particular asset s being tested for impairment as well as select a discount rate to measure the present value of the anticipated cash flows 
when determining future cash flow estimates  the company considers historical results adjusted to reflect current and anticipated operating conditions 
estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment by the company in such areas as future economic conditions  industry specific conditions  product pricing and necessary capital expenditures 
the use of different assumptions or estimates for future cash flows could produce different impairment amounts or none at all for long lived assets  goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities
