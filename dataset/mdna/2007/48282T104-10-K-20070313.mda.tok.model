item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in the consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f of this report 
overview company overview we are a leading supplier of equipment used in the global papermaking and paper recycling industries and are also a manufacturer of granules made from papermaking byproducts 
our continuing operations are comprised of one reportable operating segment pulp and papermaking systems papermaking systems  and two product lines  fiber based products and casting products  included in other businesses 
through our papermaking systems segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking and paper recycling industries 
we have a large  stable customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
we believe our large installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business  and which should be less susceptible to the cyclical trends in the paper industry 
through our fiber based products line  we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf and ornamental applications  as well as for oil and grease absorption 
we also manufacture and sell grey and ductile iron castings through our casting products business 
in addition  prior to its sale on october   we operated a composites building products business  which is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
international sales during and  approximately and  respectively  of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in china and europe 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents kadant inc annual report revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we enter into arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting were million in  million in  and million in the percentage of completion is determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirements 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china  that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations to take delivery of the equipment 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our actual results differed from our estimates  or if we were to use different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
under sab no 
 revenue recognition  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  revenues are recognized upon such acceptance 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements eg  installation  we consider the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
if equipment and installation do not meet the separation criteria under eitf no 
 revenues for products sold that require installation  for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality  and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon shipment  with estimated installation costs accrued 
we provide a reserve for the estimated warranty and installation costs at the time revenue is recognized  as applicable 
to the extent that installation becomes a significant component of our business in the future  the judgment associated with the determination of revenue recognition will increase 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of sab no 
affects the amounts reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
under sab no 
 we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on our customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 
we exercise judgment in determining our allowance for bad debts  which is based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable 
table of contents kadant inc annual report aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical writeoffs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have in the past  especially in light of business conditions in the paper industry 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating cash flows in that period 
warranty obligations for continuing operations 
we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and their applications 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in warranty return rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
warranty obligations for discontinued operation 
on october   our kadant composites llc subsidiary composites llc sold substantially all of its assets  comprising the composites business  to ldi composites co 
the buyer for approximately million in cash and the assumption of million in liabilities resulting in an  loss on sale 
as part of the sale transaction  composites llc retained the warranty obligations associated with products manufactured prior to the sale date 
activity associated with the warranty reserve is classified in the results of the discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements 
through the sale date of october   composites llc offered a standard limited warranty to the owner of its decking and roofing products  limited to repair or replacement of the defective product or a refund of the original purchase price 
prior to the sale of the composites business  composites llc recorded an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on its actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates were revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
composites llc s analysis of expected warranty claims rates included detailed assumptions associated with potential product returns  including the type of product sold  temperatures at the location of installation  density of boards  and other factors 
certain assumptions  such as the effect of weather conditions and high temperatures on the product installed  included inherent uncertainties that were subject to fluctuation 
through the second quarter of  composites llc continued to record an estimate for warranty related costs based on this methodology 
during the third quarter of  composites llc concluded that the highly subjective nature of the assumptions noted above were not accurately predicting the actual level of warranty claims making it no longer possible to calculate a reasonable estimate of the future level of potential warranty claims 
accordingly  as no amount within the total range of loss represents a best estimate of the ultimate loss to be recorded  we are required under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies to record the minimum amount of the potential range of loss 
the warranty obligation as of december  represents the low end of the estimated range of warranty reserve required based on the level of claims processed to date 
the total potential warranty cost ranges from million to approximately million 
the high end of the range represents the estimated maximum level of warranty claims remaining based on the total sales of the products under warranty 
going forward  composites llc will record adjustments to the warranty obligation to reflect the minimum amount of the 
table of contents kadant inc annual report potential range of loss 
our consolidated results in future reporting periods will be negatively impacted if the future level of warranty claims exceeds the warranty reserve 
stock based compensation 
our adoption of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  in the first quarter of requires that we recognize stock based compensation expense associated with stock options in the statement of income  rather than disclose it in a pro forma footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we did not grant any stock options in for options granted prior to january   we calculated the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we derived the estimated stock price volatility based on a review of our actual historic stock prices commensurate with the expected life of the award 
expected option life our estimate of an expected option life was derived based on a review of our historic option holding periods  including a consideration of the holding period inherent in currently vested but unexercised options 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option 
risk free interest rate we used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
similar to the analysis for the expected option life  we reviewed historical forfeiture data and have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of december  we reevaluate this analysis quarterly and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  we will recognize the actual expense over the vesting period only for the shares that vest 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not the tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  we would reverse the related valuation allowance 
our tax valuation allowance totaled million at year end should our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from our estimate  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
we provide a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
should tax return positions that we expect are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  we could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits be sustained  a reduction in our tax provision would result 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  last in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
derivatives 
we use derivative instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
when we enter into a derivative contract  we make a determination as to 
table of contents kadant inc annual report whether the transaction is deemed to be a hedge for accounting purposes 
for contracts deemed to be a hedge  we formally document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the risk being hedged 
in this documentation  we specifically identify the asset  liability  forecasted transaction  cash flow  or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item  and evaluate whether the derivative instrument is expected to reduce the risks associated with the hedged item 
to the extent these criteria are not met  we do not use hedge accounting for the derivative 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive items 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements are recognized in earnings in the period in which the exchange rates change and offset the currency gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
we perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the ineffective portion of a hedge  if any  and changes in the fair value of a derivative not deemed to be a hedge  are recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements in and to hedge a portion of our variable rate debt and have designated these agreements as cash flow hedges of the underlying obligations 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets for unrecognized gains and in other liabilities for unrecognized losses with an offset in accumulated other comprehensive items net of tax 
we have structured these interest rate swap agreements to be effective and as a result  there is no current impact to earnings resulting from hedge ineffectiveness 
we use forward currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational cash flow hedges and balance sheet fair value hedges exposures resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
such exposures primarily result from portions of our operations and assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the businesses conducting the operations or holding the assets 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge anticipated product sales and recorded accounts receivable made in the normal course of business  and accordingly  the hedges are not speculative in nature 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of using estimates from our long range forecasts 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill or intangible assets based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long range forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected based on current and anticipated cost structures 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which impairment is determined to exist 
industry and business outlook our products are primarily sold to the global pulp and paper industry 
the paper industry in north america and europe has been in a prolonged down cycle for the past several years and has undergone important structural 
table of contents kadant inc annual report changes during that time 
in contrast  the paper industry in china has experienced strong growth over the last several years 
the performance of paper producers in north america and europe has been generally improving over the past year 
however  paper producers in those regions continue to be negatively affected by higher operating costs  especially higher energy and chemical costs 
we believe paper companies are still cautious about increasing their capital and operating spending in the current market environment 
as the financial performance of paper companies has improved  they have increased their capital and operating spending  which has had a positive effect on paper company suppliers  such as our company 
we continue to concentrate our efforts on several initiatives intended to improve our operating results  including i increasing sales of paper machine accessories and water management products in china  ii increasing our use of low cost manufacturing bases in china and mexico  iii penetrating new markets outside the paper industry  and iv increasing aftermarket sales in china 
in addition  we continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs  capital expenditures  and working capital 
on may   we acquired all the outstanding stock of the johnson corporation kadant johnson  a leading supplier of fluid handling systems and equipment  including steam and condensate systems  components  and controls 
these products are used primarily in the dryer section of the papermaking process and in the production of corrugated boxboard  metals  plastics  rubber  textiles  and food 
kadant johnson was a privately held company based in three rivers  michigan  with approximately employees 
the purchase price for the acquisition was approximately million  including million paid in cash at closing  million paid in the fourth quarter of in settlement of post closing adjustments  million paid for acquisition related costs  and million of additional cash consideration we expect to pay in annual installments through the additional consideration of million relates to certain tax assets of kadant johnson  the value of which we expect to realize 
we paid million of this additional consideration in  and the remaining amount is due over the next four years as follows million in each of  and  and million in on june   our subsidiary kadant light machinery jining co  ltd 
kadant jining  assumed responsibility for the operation of jining huayi light industry machinery co  ltd 
huayi and  by september   acquired the assets of huayi  including cash  inventory  machinery  equipment  and buildings for million  net of million of assumed liabilities kadant jining acquisition 
the remaining purchase obligation  which has been accrued as of december   is million which we expect to pay through january as certain post closing and indemnification obligations are satisfied 
huayi was a supplier of stock preparation equipment in china 
in the last several years  china has become a significant market for our stock preparation equipment 
a large percentage of the world s increases in paper production capacity are in china 
consequently  competition is intense and there is increasing pricing pressure particularly for large systems 
to capitalize on this growing market  we plan to start manufacturing certain of our accessory and water management products in our china facilities in currently  our revenues from china are primarily derived from large capital orders  the timing of which is often difficult to predict 
at times  our customers in china have experienced delays in obtaining financing for their capital addition and expansion projects due to efforts by the chinese government to control economic growth  which are reflected in a slowdown in financing approvals in china s banking system 
these delays and delays in receiving down payments  could delay our recognizing revenue on these projects to periods later than originally anticipated 
we plan to use kadant jining as a base for increasing our aftermarket business  which we believe will be more predictable 
our guidance reflects expected revenues and earnings per share from continuing operations  which exclude the results from our discontinued operation 
for the first quarter of  we expect to earn between 
and 
per diluted share  on revenues of to million 
for the full year  we expect to earn between and per diluted share which includes a 
decline in profitability from our fiber based products business  on revenues of to million

the presentation of the changes in revenues by product line  excluding the effect of currency translation  is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles measure

the gross profit margin at the papermaking systems segment decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily due to lower margins in our stock preparation equipment product line as a result of several large capital equipment orders from china  which had lower than normal gross profit margin levels 
also contributing to the decrease was an unfavorable product mix that shifted toward lower margin capital products 
partially offsetting this were improved gross margins at our fluid handling product line 
the gross profit margin at our other businesses was in and we expect the gross profit margin in the fiber based products business to be negatively affected by lower revenue in due to increased competition in this market

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we entered into receive variable and pay fixed swap agreements in and to hedge a portion of our variable rate long term debt 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward foreign exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the variable rates to which these financial instruments may adjust in the future 
a decrease in year end interest rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in both and a portion of our outstanding debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we hedged million and million of our debt at year end and  respectively  with receive variable pay fixed swap agreements 
the fair values of the swap agreements are sensitive to changes in long term swap rates 
a decrease in the long term swap rates would have resulted in an increase of unrealized losses of million and million as of year end and  respectively 
the remaining unhedged portion of the debt totaling million and million as of year end and  respectively  is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of year end the interest rate on the unhedged portion of our us debt was based on libor and for our foreign debt based on rates established by the bank of china limited 
as of year end  the interest rate on the unhedged portion of the debt was based on libor 
a increase in the year end rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in both and currency exchange rates we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  canadian dollars  chinese renminbi and brazilian reals 
the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders investment 
a depreciation in functional currencies at year end and  relative to the us dollar  would have resulted in a reduction in shareholders investment of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses on forward foreign exchange contracts of million and million in and  respectively 
since we use forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
