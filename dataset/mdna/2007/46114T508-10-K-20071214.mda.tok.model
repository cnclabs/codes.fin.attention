the increase in stock based compensation expense resulting from the restatement is as follows in thousands pre tax after tax as income income as previously expense expense restated reported adjustments adjustments for the year ended december  total impact to total 
table of contents from our inception  we have provided a full valuation allowance against all of our united states federal and state net deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no  accounting for income taxes 
in connection with the required stock based compensation adjustments  we recorded additional deferred tax assets of  and a corresponding full valuation allowance for the incremental stock based compensation expense over the option vesting periods for grants to individuals who were employed in tax jurisdictions where a tax deduction was available 
accordingly  we have not recorded any tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations 
the payroll taxes associated with remeasured stock options as a result of the voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices were inconsequential 
our restatement also reflects previously unrecorded adjustments for the years ended december    and for support and services revenues and allowance for doubtful accounts expense not related to accounting for stock options that were previously deemed to be immaterial on an interim and annual basis to our consolidated financial statements 
we have also restated our deferred tax assets as of december  reducing our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
upon review  we determined that such carryforwards did not properly consider the impact of various statutory limitations and as a result  deferred tax assets were overstated by approximately million 
this adjustment did not impact our consolidated statements of operations  balance sheets  stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss  and cash flows as our deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowance

we generally charge a daily fee for such classes 
web based training is also available on a per course basis online course as well as education consulting on a time and materials basis to address customer specific curriculum needs 
customers our software products and services are marketed and sold to a diverse group of customers in a broad range of industries 
our customers typically include businesses looking to unify people  content and processes to reduce business risk  accelerate time to value and or sustain lower total cost of ownership 
we believe that our customers typically consider content management applications to be critical to their success 
as of september   over  companies had licensed our software products 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in the years ended december   or revenues from customers in the united states of america accounted for  and of our total revenues in the years ended december   and  respectively 
sales and marketing we market and license our software products and services primarily through a direct sales force  and we augment our sales efforts through relationships with technology vendors  professional service firms  systems integrators and other strategic partners 
we have sales offices and maintain operations in australia  france  germany  hong kong  italy  india  japan  the netherlands  people s republic of china  singapore  south korea  spain  sweden  taiwan  the united kingdom and in various locations throughout the united states 
reflecting our commitment to our international initiatives  we have introduced localized versions of our software for several major european and asia pacific markets 

table of contents we have developed an indirect sales channel by establishing relationships with technology vendors  professional services firms and systems integrators that recommend and  when appropriate  resell our products 
several of our partners have also built add on products to extend the functionality of our software 
we believe that our business is not substantially dependent on any one technology vendor  professional services firm or system integrator 
however  our relationships with these entities on the whole are critical to our success 
our ability to grow revenue in future periods will depend in large part on how successfully we recruit  train and retain sufficient direct sales  technical and customer support personnel  and our ability to establish and maintain strategic relationships with technology vendors  professional services firms and systems integrators 
research and development since our inception  we have devoted significant resources to develop our products  solutions and technologies 
we believe that our future success will depend  in large part  on our ability to develop new product offerings and enhance and extend the features of our existing products 
our product development organization is responsible for product architecture  core technology  quality assurance  documentation and expanding the ability of our products to operate with leading hardware platforms  operating systems  database management systems and key electronic commerce transaction processing standards 
we currently have research and development operations in san jose  california  chicago  illinois  atlanta  georgia  austin  texas and in bangalore  india 
our research and development expenditures were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
all research and development expenditures have been expensed as incurred 
we have devoted and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities 
acquisitions an acquisition program is an important element of our overall corporate strategy and  over the past several years  we have focused on expanding our product offerings in the content management market through acquisition 
in recent years  we have added through acquisition of products and solutions with digital asset management  collaborative document management  records management  content publishing  targeted content optimization and capital markets vertical market capabilities 
competition the content management market is rapidly changing and intensely competitive 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition from current and potential competitors 
our current competitors include companies addressing needs of the market in which we compete such as emc corporation  ibm  microsoft corporation  open text corporation  oracle corporation  vignette corporation and xerox corporation  intranet and groupware companies  such as ibm  microsoft corporation and novell  inc  open source vendors  such as redhat  inc  opencms and mambo  and in house development efforts by our customers and partners 
we also face potential competition from our strategic partners  such as microsoft corporation and ibm  or from other companies that may in the future decide to compete in our market  including companies that currently only compete with us for sales to small and medium sized enterprises 
many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
many of these companies can also take advantage of extensive customer bases and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
potential competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or makes their products more appealing 
for example  during the second half of  microsoft corporation bundled a content management solution  sharepoint server  into its microsoft office suite of products 
barriers to entering the content management software market are relatively low 
competitive pressures may also increase with the consolidation of competitors within our market and 
table of contents partners in our distribution channel  such as the acquisition of stellent  inc by oracle corporation  captiva software corporation  documentum  inc and rsa security inc 
by emc corporation  filenet  inc by ibm  artesia technologies  inc 
and hummingbird  ltd 
by open text corporation and tower technology pty ltd 
and epicentric  inc by vignette corporation 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market for content management solutions are breadth of the enterprise content management solution  product functionality and features  coverage of sales force and distribution channel  availability of global support  quality and depth of integration of the individual software modules across the full content management suite  ease and speed of product implementation  hardware implications and the total cost of ownership required to deploy content management solutions  financial condition of vendors  vendor and product reputation  ability of products to support large numbers of concurrent users  price  security  interoperability with established software  scalability  and ease of access and use 
although we believe that we compete favorably with respect to many of the above factors  our market is rapidly evolving 
we may not be able to maintain our competitive position against current and potential competitors 
seasonality our business is influenced by seasonal trends  largely due to customer buying patterns 
these trends may include higher license revenues in the fourth quarter as many customers complete annual budgetary cycles and lower license revenues in the first quarter and summer months when many of our prospects and customers experience lower sales  particularly in the europe our consulting and training services are negatively impacted in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season  in which fewer billable hours are available for our consultants and fewer training classes are scheduled by our customers 
intellectual property and other proprietary rights our success depends in part on the development and protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others 
to protect our technology  we rely primarily on patent  trademark  service mark  trade secret and copyright laws and contractual restrictions 
we require our customers to enter into license agreements that impose restrictions on their ability to reproduce  distribute and use our software 
in addition  we seek to avoid disclosure of our trade secrets through a number of means  including restricting access to our source code and object code and requiring those entities and persons with access to agree to confidentiality terms that restrict their use and disclosure 
we seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws  which afford only limited protection 

table of contents we currently have issued united states patents and issued foreign patents 
these patents have remaining lives ranging from to years  with an average remaining life of years 
we also have applied for other patents in the united states and we have pending foreign patent applications 
it is possible that no patents will be issued from our currently pending patent applications and that our existing patents may be found to be invalid or unenforceable  or may be successfully challenged 
it is also possible that any patent issued to us may not provide us with competitive advantages or that we may not develop future proprietary products or technologies that are patentable 
additionally  we have not performed a comprehensive analysis of the patents of others that may limit our ability to do business 
while our patents are an important element of our success  our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any one patent or on the combination of all of our patents 
we rely on software licensed from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software 
these software license agreements expire on various dates from to and the majority of these agreements are renewable with written consent of the parties 
either party may terminate the agreement for cause before the expiration date with written notice 
if we cannot renew these licenses  shipments of our products could be delayed until equivalent software could be developed or licensed and integrated into our products 
these types of delays could seriously harm our business 
in addition  we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license our software ceased to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
moreover  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights and technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or obtain the source code to our software or use other information that we regard as proprietary or could develop software competitive to ours 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists  software piracy may become a problem 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our competitors  some of whom have greater resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make and license our products 
we have not conducted an independent review of patents issued to third parties 
it is possible that one or more third parties may make claims of infringement or misappropriation against us or third parties from whom we license technology 
any claim or any other claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  cause us to cease making  licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign or reengineer our products  if feasible  divert our management s attention or resources  or cause product delays 
in addition  we may decide to pay substantial settlement costs in connection with any claim  whether or not successfully asserted against us 
if our product is found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our products 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of infringement or misappropriation against us or third party licensors in connection with the use of our technology  or a large settlement paid by us in connection with any claim  could adversely affect our business 
employees as of december   we employed people  including in sales and marketing  in research and development  in support and professional services and in general and administrative functions 
of our employees  were located in north america  were located in the asia pacific region and were located in europe 
our future success depends in part on our ability to attract  hire and retain qualified personnel 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  other than statutory unions required by law in certain european countries 
we have not experienced any work stoppages and consider our relations with our employees to be good 

table of contents item a 
risk factors we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing business environment that involves many risks and uncertainties 
in this section  we discuss factors that could cause  or contribute to causing  actual results to differ materially from what we expect or from any historical patterns or trends 
as you evaluate our business  you should consider the risks and uncertainties described below  as well as cautionary language elsewhere in this annual report on form k and in our subsequent filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the audit committee review of our historical stock option practices and resulting restatement has been time consuming and expensive  and may have a material adverse effect on us 
the audit committee review of our historical stock option granting practices and the related restatement activities have required us to expend a significant amount of management time and to incur significant accounting  legal and other expenses 
it is difficult for us to predict how much time will be required for us to resolve any follow up matters that may arise as a result of the review and restatement  or what additional resources may be required 
the cost and time required to complete any follow up required as a result of the audit committee review  and to complete the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and the filing of our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission may have a material adverse effect on our operating results or cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may be named in lawsuits in the future 
any such litigation could become time consuming and expensive and could result in the payment of significant judgments and settlements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may face future government actions  shareholder or derivative lawsuits and other legal proceedings related to the audit committee review of our historical stock option practices and the related restatement activities 
we cannot predict when and whether any such lawsuits or other actions will occur  nor can we predict the outcome of any such lawsuits or other actions  or the amount of time and expense that will be required to resolve these lawsuits or other actions 
if any such lawsuits or other actions occur  they may be time consuming and expensive  and unfavorable outcomes in any such cases could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any of these events may require us to expend significant management time and to incur significant accounting  legal and other expenses  which could divert attention and resources from our business and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not cover all or part of any such lawsuits or actions  in part because we have a significant deductible on certain aspects of the coverage 
in addition  subject to certain limitations  we may be obligated to indemnify our current and former directors  officers and employees 
we currently hold insurance policies for the benefit of our directors and officers  but it may not be sufficient to cover costs we may incur 
furthermore  the insurers may seek to deny or limit coverage in these matters  in which case we may have to self fund all or a substantial portion of our indemnification obligations 
if we need to self fund  there is no assurance that we will prevail in our efforts to recover payment from our insurers 
failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may cause us to delay filing our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission  affect our nasdaq global market listing and adversely affect our stock price 
under securities and exchange commission rules  we are required to include a report of management on our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k that contains an assessment by management of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  our independent registered public accounting firm must attest to and report on management s assessment of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting 
if we determine that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective  investors may lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could negatively impact the price of our common stock 
the securities and exchange commission may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of the stock option grants that are being remeasured  and there is a risk 
table of contents that its inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior consolidated financial statements  amend prior filings with the securities and exchange commission  or otherwise take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  the securities and exchange commission may issue guidance or disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or prior filings with the securities and exchange commission to provide additional disclosures pursuant to this guidance 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent securities and exchange commission reports and  ultimately  the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global market 
we have not been in compliance with nasdaq listing requirements and remain subject to the risk of our common stock being delisted from the nasdaq global market  which could  among other things  reduce the price of our common stock and the levels of liquidity available to our stockholders 
pending completion of our audit committee s review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting  we were delinquent in filing our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission and  consequently  we were not in compliance with applicable nasdaq listing requirements and our common stock became subject to delisting from the nasdaq global market 
the board of directors of the nasdaq stock market  llc called for review and stayed a decision of the nasdaq listing and hearings review council to suspend our common stock from trading on the nasdaq global market on december  if we did not file all our delinquent securities and exchange commission reports and restatements by december   permitting our common stock to remain listed on the nasdaq global market until we were able to file this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for the periods ended march   june  and september  we are waiting to receive confirmation that we have remedied our non compliance with nasdaq listing requirements 
if  after completion of its compliance protocols  the nasdaq stock market does not confirm that we are in compliance with the applicable listing requirements  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq global market and it would be uncertain when  if ever  our common stock would be relisted 
even if we do regain compliance with the applicable nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted in the future if we do not maintain compliance with applicable nasdaq listing requirements 
for example  we will not be able to hold our annual meeting of stockholders on or before december   which would constitute a failure to meet applicable nasdaq listing requirements 
it is expected that we will receive a staff determination letter from nasdaq notifying us that our common stock would be subject to delisting as a result of our noncompliance with nasdaq listing requirements for failure to hold an annual meeting of stockholders on a timely basis  and of our right to request a hearing before the nasdaq listing qualifications panel 
if our common stock is delisted from the nasdaq global market  there can be no assurance that our common stock would be relisted or we will be able to obtain listing of our common stock on another national securities exchange 
if we are not successful in listing our common stock on a national securities exchange  the price of our common stock  the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock  and our ability to raise capital could be adversely affected 
we have only recently begun to report net income and may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have incurred operating losses for most of our history 
although we have recently begun reporting net income  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of december  million as of september  
we must increase both our license and support and service revenues to sustain profitable operations and positive cash flows 
if we are able to maintain profitability and positive cash flows  we cannot assure you that we can sustain or increase profitability or cash flows on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
failure to achieve such financial performance would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  if revenues decline  resulting in greater operating losses and significant negative cash flows  our business could fail and the price of our common stock would decline 

table of contents many factors can cause our operating results to fluctuate and if we fail to satisfy the expectations of investors or securities analysts  our stock price may decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect unpredictable fluctuations in the future 
the main factors impacting these fluctuations are likely to be the discretionary nature of our customers purchases and their budget cycles  the inherent complexity  length and associated unpredictability of our sales cycle  seasonal fluctuations in information technology purchasing  the success or failure of any of our product offerings to meet with customer acceptance  delays in recognizing revenue from license transactions  timing of new product releases  timing of large customer orders  changes in competitors product offerings  sales force capacity and the influence of resellers and systems integrator partners  our ability to integrate newly acquired products or technologies with our existing products and effectively sell newly acquired or enhanced products  and the level of our sales incentive and commission related expenses 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
further  because we experience seasonal variations in our operating results as part of our normal business cycle  we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that you should not rely on the results of one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
if our results of operations do not meet our public forecasts or the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our common stock is likely to decline 
sales cycles for our products are generally long and unpredictable  so it is difficult to forecast our future results 
the length of our sales cycle the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the licensing of our software applications typically ranges from six to twelve months and can be more than twelve months 
customer orders often include the purchase of multiple products 
these kinds of orders are complex and difficult to complete because prospective customers generally consider a number of factors over an extended period of time before committing to purchase a suite of products or applications 
prospective customers consider many factors in evaluating our software  and the length of time a customer devotes to evaluation  contract negotiation and budgeting processes vary significantly from company to company 
as a result  we spend a great deal of time and resources informing prospective customers about our solutions and services  incurring expenses that will lower our operating margins if no sale occurs 
even if a customer chooses to buy our software products or services  many factors affect the timing of revenue recognition as defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which makes our revenues difficult to forecast 
these factors contributing to the timing variability of revenue recognition include the following licensing of our software products is often an enterprise wide decision by our customers that involves many customer specific factors  so our ability to make a sale may be affected by changes in the strategic importance of a particular project to a customer  budgetary constraints of the customer or changes in customer personnel 
customer approval and expenditure authorization processes can be difficult and time consuming  and delays in the process could impact the timing and amount of revenues recognized in a quarter 
changes in our sales incentive plans may have unexpected effects on our sales cycle and contracting activities 
the significance and timing of our software enhancements  and the introduction of new software by our competitors  may affect customer purchases 

table of contents our sales cycles are affected by intense customer scrutiny of software purchases regardless of transaction size 
if our sales cycles lengthen  our future revenue could be lower than expected  which would have an adverse impact on our consolidated operating results and could cause our stock price to decline 
our sales incentive plans are primarily based on quarterly and annual quotas for sales representatives and some sales support personnel  and include accelerated commission rates if a representative exceeds their assigned sales quota 
the concentration of sales orders with a small number of sales representatives has resulted  and in the future may result  in commission expense exceeding forecasted levels  which would result in higher sales and marketing expenses 
contractual terms or issues that arise during the negotiation process may delay anticipated transactions and revenue 
because our software and solutions are often a critical element of the information technology systems of our customers  the process of contractual negotiation is often protracted 
the additional time needed to negotiate mutually acceptable terms that culminate in an agreement to license our products can extend the sales cycle 
several factors may require us to defer recognition of license revenue for a significant period of time after entering into a license agreement  including instances in which we are required to deliver either specified additional products or product upgrades for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
we have a standard software license agreement that provides for revenue recognition assuming that  among other factors  delivery has taken place  collectibility from the customer is probable and no significant future obligations or customer acceptance rights exist 
however  customer negotiations and revisions to these terms could have an impact on our ability to recognize revenue at the time of delivery 
in addition  slowdowns or variances from our expectations of our quarterly licensing activities may result in fewer customers  which could result in lower revenues from our customer training  consulting services and customer support organizations 
our ability to maintain or increase support and service revenues is highly dependent on our ability to increase the number of enterprises that license our software products and the number of seats licensed by those enterprises 
our revenues depend on a small number of products and markets  so our results are vulnerable to unexpected shifts in demand 
for the years ended december   and and for the nine months ended september   we believe that a significant portion of our total revenue was derived from our interwoven teamsite and interwoven worksite products and related services  and we expect this to be the case in future periods 
accordingly  any decline in the demand for these products and related services will have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
we also derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of vertical markets 
in particular  our worksite product is primarily sold to professional services organizations  such as law firms  accounting firms  consulting firms and corporate legal departments 
in addition  we derive a significant amount of our revenue from companies in the financial services industry 
in order to sustain and grow our business  we must continue to sell our software products and services into these vertical markets 
shifts in the dynamics of these vertical markets  such as new product introductions by our competitors  could seriously harm our prospects 
further  our reliance on a limited number of vertical markets exposes our operating results to the same macroeconomic risks and changing economic conditions that affect those vertical markets 
for example  if the recent turbulence in the financial markets continues  our customers in the financial services industry may reduce spending and our results could suffer 
to increase our sales outside our core vertical markets  for example to large multi national corporations in manufacturing  telecommunications and governmental entities  requires us to devote time and resources to hire and train sales employees familiar with those industries 
even if we are successful in hiring and training sales teams  customers in other industries may not need or sufficiently value our products 

table of contents support and service revenues have represented a large percentage of our total revenues 
our support and service revenues are vulnerable to reduced demand and increased competition 
our support and service revenues represented approximately  and of total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  and for the nine months ended september  support and service revenues depend  in part  on our ability to license software products to new and existing customers that generate follow on consulting  training and support revenues 
thus  any reduction in license revenue is likely to result in lower support and services revenue in the future 
the demand for consulting  training and support services is affected by competition from independent service providers and strategic partners  resellers and other systems integrators with knowledge of our software products 
factors other than price may not be determinative of whether prospective customers of consulting services engage us or alternative service providers 
we have experienced increased competition for consulting services engagements  which has resulted in an overall decrease in average billing rates for our consultants and price pressure on our software support products 
if our business continues to be affected this way  our support and service revenues and the related gross margin from these revenues may decline 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized support revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
our support agreements typically have a term of one year and are renewable thereafter for periods generally of one year 
customer support revenues are primarily influenced by the number and size of new support contracts sold in connection with software licenses and the renewal rate of existing support contracts 
customers may elect not to renew their support agreements  renew their support contracts at lower prices or may reduce the license software quantity under their support agreements  thereby reducing our future support revenue 
our revenues from international operations are a significant part of our overall operating results 
we have established offices in various international locations in europe and asia pacific and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from these international locations 
for the years ended december   and  revenues from our international operations were approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively  and were for the nine months ended september  we anticipate devoting significant resources and management attention to international opportunities  which subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties including difficulties in attracting and retaining staff particularly sales personnel and managing foreign operations  the expense of foreign operations and compliance with applicable laws  political and economic instability  the expense of localizing our products for sale in various international markets and providing support and services in the local language  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  difficulties in the handling of transactions denominated in foreign currency and the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  regulation by united states federal and state laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act  and foreign laws  regulations and policies  changes in multiple tax and regulatory requirements  the effect of longer sales cycles and collection periods or seasonal reductions in business activity  and economic conditions in international markets 
any of these risks could reduce revenues from international locations or increase our cost of doing business outside of the united states 

table of contents the timing of large customer orders may have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results from period to period 
our ability to achieve our forecasted quarterly earnings is dependent on receiving a significant number of license transactions in the mid to high six figure range or possibly even larger orders 
from time to time  we receive large customer orders that have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results in the period in which the order is recognized as revenue 
we had four individual license transactions in excess of million in the nine months ended september  and we had three  four and three such license transactions in  and  respectively 
because it is difficult for us to accurately predict the timing of large customer orders  our consolidated financial results are likely to vary materially from quarter to quarter based on the receipt of such orders and their ultimate recognition as revenue 
additionally  the loss or delay of an anticipated large order in a given quarterly period could result in a shortfall of revenues from anticipated levels 
any shortfall in revenues from levels anticipated by our stockholders and securities analysts could have a material and adverse impact on the trading price of our common stock 
we must attract and retain qualified personnel to be successful and competition for qualified personnel is increasing in our market 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued contributions of our key management  technical  sales  marketing and consulting personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
the loss of one or more of these employees could harm our business 
we do not have key person life insurance for any of our key personnel 
our success also depends on our ability to identify  attract and retain qualified technical  sales  marketing  consulting and managerial personnel 
competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in our industry and in many of the geographies in which we operate 
this makes it difficult to retain our key employees and to recruit highly qualified personnel 
we have experienced  and may continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining candidates with appropriate qualifications 
to be successful  we need to hire candidates with appropriate qualifications and retain our key executives and employees 
the volatility of our stock price has had an impact on our ability to offer competitive equity based incentives to current and prospective employees  thereby affecting our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical personnel 
if these adverse conditions continue  we may not be able to hire or retain highly qualified employees in the future and this could harm our business 
in addition  regulations adopted by the nasdaq stock market requiring stockholder approval for all stock option plans  as well as regulations adopted by the new york stock exchange prohibiting nyse member organizations from giving a proxy to vote on equity compensation plans unless the beneficial owner of the shares has given voting instructions  could make it more difficult for us to grant options to employees in the future 
in addition  sfas no 
r  share based payment  which came into effect on january   requires us to record stock based compensation expense for the fair value of equity awards granted to employees 
to the extent that new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant equity awards to employees  we may incur increased cash compensation costs or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  either of which could harm our business 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions  and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and management 
in the past  we have acquired companies  products or technologies  such as our recently completed acquisition of optimost llc optimost  and we are likely to do so in the future 
we may not realize the anticipated benefits of this or any other acquisition and each acquisition has numerous risks 
these risks include difficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired company  difficulty in effectively integrating the acquired technologies or products with our current products and technologies  difficulty in maintaining controls  procedures and policies during the transition and integration  disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of our management and employees from other opportunities and challenges due to integration issues  
table of contents difficulty integrating the acquired company s accounting  management information  human resources and other administrative systems  inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel of the acquired business  inability to retain key customers  distributors  vendors and other business partners of the acquired business  inability to achieve the financial and strategic goals for the acquired and combined businesses  incurring acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired intangible assets that could impact our operating results  potential impairment of our relationships with employees  customers  partners  distributors or third party providers of technology or products  potential failure of the due diligence processes to identify significant issues with product quality  architecture and development  integration obstacles or legal and financial contingencies  among other things  incurring significant exit charges if products acquired in business combinations are unsuccessful  incurring additional expenses if disputes arise in connection with any acquisition  potential inability to assert that internal controls over financial reporting are effective  potential inability to obtain  or obtain in a timely manner  approvals from governmental authorities  which could delay or prevent such acquisitions  and potential delay in customer and distributor purchasing decisions due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings 
mergers and acquisitions of high technology companies are inherently risky and ultimately  if we do not complete the integration of acquired businesses successfully and in a timely manner  we may not realize the benefits of the acquisitions to the extent anticipated  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the terms of our acquisitions may provide for future obligations  such as our payment of additional consideration upon the occurrence of specified future events or the achievement of future revenues or other financial milestones 
to the extent these events or achievements involve subjective determinations  disputes may arise that require a third party to assess  resolve and or make such determinations  or involve arbitration or litigation 
for example  several of our recent acquisitions have included earn out arrangements that contain audit rights 
should a dispute arise over determinations made under those arrangements  we may be forced to incur additional costs and spend time defending our position  and may ultimately lose the dispute  any of these outcomes would cause us not to realize all the anticipated benefits of the related acquisition and could impact our consolidated results of operations 
economic conditions and significant world events have harmed and could continue to negatively affect our revenues and results of operations 
our revenue growth and profitability depend on the overall demand for our content management software applications and solutions 
the decline in customer spending on many kinds of information technology initiatives worldwide over the first half of this decade has resulted in lower revenues  longer sales cycles  lower average selling prices and customer deferral of orders 
to the extent that information technology spending  particularly spending on public facing web applications  does not continue to improve or declines from current levels  the demand for our products and services  and therefore our future revenues  will be negatively affected 
further  declines in our customers markets or in general economic conditions could reduce demand for our software applications and services  which would negatively affect our future revenues 
for example  if the recent turbulence in the financial markets continues  our customers in the financial services industry may reduce spending and our results could suffer 
if general or market specific economic conditions worsen  the time it takes us to collect accounts receivable could lengthen and some accounts receivable could become uncollectible 
as a result of these factors  our consolidated financial results could be significantly and adversely affected 

table of contents our consolidated financial results could also be significantly and adversely affected by geopolitical concerns and world events  such as wars and terrorist attacks 
our revenues and financial results have been and could be negatively affected to the extent geopolitical concerns continue and similar events occur or are anticipated to occur 
increasing competition could cause us to reduce our prices and result in lower gross margins or loss of market share 
the enterprise content management market is rapidly changing and highly competitive 
our current competitors include companies addressing needs of the market in which we compete such as emc corporation  ibm  microsoft corporation  open text corporation  oracle corporation  vignette corporation and xerox corporation  intranet and groupware companies  such as ibm  microsoft corporation and novell  inc  open source vendors  such as opencms  mambo and redhat  inc  and in house development efforts by our customers and partners 
we also face potential competition from our strategic partners  such as microsoft corporation and ibm  or from other companies that may in the future decide to compete in our market  including companies that currently only compete with us for sales to small and medium sized enterprises 
many existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition and greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
many of these companies can also take advantage of extensive customer bases and adopt aggressive pricing policies to gain market share 
potential competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages users from purchasing our products or makes their products more appealing 
for example  during the second half of  microsoft corporation bundled a content management solution  sharepoint server  into its microsoft office suite of products 
barriers to entering the content management software market are relatively low 
competitive pressures may also increase with the consolidation of competitors within our market and partners in our distribution channel  such as the acquisition of stellent  inc by oracle corporation  captiva software corporation  documentum  inc and rsa security inc 
by emc corporation  filenet  inc by ibm  artesia technologies  inc 
and hummingbird  ltd 
by open text corporation and tower technology pty ltd 
and epicentric  inc by vignette corporation 
with the intense competition in enterprise content management  some of our competitors  from time to time  have reduced their price proposals in an effort to strengthen their bids and expand their customer bases at our expense 
even if these tactics are unsuccessful  they could delay decisions by some customers who would otherwise purchase our software products and may reduce the ultimate selling price of our software and services  reducing our gross margins 
our future revenues depend in part on our installed customer base continuing to license additional products  renew customer support agreements and purchase additional services 
our installed customer base has traditionally generated additional license and support and service revenues 
in addition  the success of our strategic plan depends on our ability to cross sell products to our installed base of customers  such as the products acquired in our recent acquisitions 
our ability to cross sell new products may depend in part on the degree to which new products have been integrated with our existing applications  which may vary with the timing of new product acquisitions or releases 
in future periods  customers may not necessarily license additional products or contract for additional support or other services 
customer support agreements are generally renewable annually at a customer s option  and there are no mandatory payment obligations or obligations to license additional software 
customer support revenues are primarily influenced by the number and size of new support contracts sold in connection with software licenses and the renewal rate both pricing and participation of existing support contracts 
if our customers decide to cancel their support agreements or fail to license additional products or contract for additional services  or if they reduce the scope of their support agreements  revenues could decrease and our operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents because a significant portion of our revenues are influenced by referrals from strategic partners and  in some cases  sold through resellers  our future success depends in part on those partners  but their interests may differ from ours 
our direct sales force depends  in part  on strategic partnerships  marketing alliances and resellers to obtain customer leads  referrals and distribution 
approximately of our new license orders from customers for the year ended december  and the nine months ended september  were influenced by or co sold with our strategic partners and resellers 
if we are unable to maintain our existing strategic relationships or fail to enter into additional strategic relationships  our ability to increase revenues will be harmed  and we could also lose anticipated customer introductions and co marketing benefits and lose our investments in those relationships 
in addition  revenues from any strategic partnership  no matter how significant we expect it to be  depend on a number of factors outside our control  are highly uncertain and may vary from period to period 
our success depends in part on the success of our strategic partners and their ability and willingness to market our products and services successfully 
losing the support of these third parties may limit our ability to compete in existing and potential markets 
these third parties are under no obligation to recommend or support our software products and could recommend or give higher priority to the products and services of other companies  including those of one or more of our competitors  or to their own products 
our inability to gain the support of resellers  consulting and systems integrator firms or a shift by these companies toward favoring competing products could negatively affect our software license and support and service revenues 
some systems integrators also engage in joint marketing and sales efforts with us 
if our relationships with these parties fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sale and marketing of our software products 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have longer and more established relationships with these systems integrators than we do and  as a result  these systems integrators may be more inclined to recommend competitors products and services 
we may also be unable to grow our revenues if we do not successfully obtain leads and referrals from our customers 
if we are unable to maintain these existing customer relationships or fail to establish additional relationships of this kind  we will be required to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing of our products 
as a result  we depend on the willingness of our customers to provide us with introductions  referrals and leads 
our current customer relationships do not afford us any exclusive marketing and distribution rights 
in addition  our customers may terminate their relationship with us at any time  pursue relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products that compete with our products 
even if our customers act as references and provide us with leads and introductions  we may not grow our revenues or be able to maintain or reduce sales and marketing expenses 
we also rely on our strategic relationships to aid in the development of our products 
should our strategic partners not regard us as significant to their own businesses  they could reduce their commitment to us or terminate their relationship with us  pursue competing relationships or attempt to develop or acquire products or services that compete with our products and services 
fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currency  particularly in euro  british pound and australian dollar and the various other local currencies of europe and asia  may harm our business 
we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes 
our primary exposures have related to operating expenses and sales in europe and asia that were not united states dollar denominated 
weakness in the united states dollar compared to foreign currencies has significantly increased the cost of our european based operations in recent periods  as compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
we are unable to predict the extent to which expenses in future periods will be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to the extent our international revenues and operations continue to grow  currency fluctuations could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our stock price may be volatile  and your investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the market prices of the securities of software companies  including our own  have been extremely volatile and often unrelated to their operating performance 
broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
factors that could cause fluctuations in the price of our stock may include  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results  or key balance sheet metrics such as days sales outstanding  changes in financial estimates by us or in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who cover our stock  operating performance and stock market price and volume fluctuations of other publicly traded companies and  in particular  those that are deemed comparable to us  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or services  technological innovations  significant acquisitions  strategic relationships or divestitures  our failure to realize the expected benefits of acquisitions  announcements of investigations or regulatory scrutiny of our operations or lawsuits filed against us  announcements of negative conclusions about our internal controls  articles in periodicals covering us  our competitors or our markets  reports issued by market research and financial analysts  capital outlays or commitments  additions or departures of key personnel  sector factors including conditions or trends in our industry and the technology arena  and overall stock market factors  such as the price of oil futures  interest rates and the performance of the economy 
these fluctuations have made  and may make it more difficult to use our stock as currency to make acquisitions that might otherwise be advantageous  or to use stock compensation equity instruments as a means to attract and retain employees 
any shortfall in revenue or operating results compared to expectations could cause an immediate and significant decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  we may not learn of such shortfalls until late in the quarter and may not be able to adjust successfully to these shortfalls  which could result in an even more immediate and greater decline in the trading price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
if we become subject to any litigation of this type  we could incur substantial costs and our management s attention and resources could be diverted while the litigation is ongoing 
our failure to deliver defect free software could result in losses and harmful publicity 
our software products are complex and have in the past and may in the future contain defects or failures that may be detected at any point in the product s life 
we have discovered software defects in the past in some of our products after their release 
although past defects have not had a material effect on our results of operations  in the future we may experience delays or lost revenues caused by new defects 
despite our testing  defects and errors may still be found in new or existing products  and may result in delayed or lost revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  reduced customer satisfaction  diversion of development resources and damage to our reputation 
as has occurred in the past  new releases of products or product enhancements may require us to provide additional services under our support contracts to ensure proper installation and implementation 

table of contents errors in our application suite may be caused by defects in third party software incorporated into our applications 
if so  we may not be able to fix these defects without the cooperation of these software providers 
since these defects may not be as significant to our software providers as they are to us  we may not receive the rapid cooperation that we may require 
we may not have the contractual right to access the source code of third party software and  even if we access the source code  we may not be able to fix the defect 
as customers rely on our products for critical business applications  errors  defects or other performance problems of our products or services might result in damage to the businesses of our customers 
consequently  these customers could delay or withhold payment to us for our software and services  which could result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts or an increase in collection cycles for accounts receivable  both of which could disappoint investors and result in a significant decline in our stock price 
in addition  these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  a product liability claim brought against us would likely be time consuming and costly and harm our reputation  and thus our ability to license products to new customers 
even if a suit is not brought  correcting errors in our application suite could increase our expenses 
if our products cannot scale to meet the demands of thousands of concurrent users  our targeted customers may not license our software  which will cause our revenues to decline 
our strategy includes targeting large organizations that require our enterprise content management software because of the significant amounts of content that these companies generate and use 
for this strategy to succeed  our software products must be highly scalable and accommodate thousands of concurrent users 
if our products cannot scale to accommodate a large number of concurrent users  our target markets will not accept our products and our business and operating results will suffer 
if our customers cannot successfully implement large scale deployments of our software or if they determine that our products cannot accommodate large scale deployments  our customers will not license our solutions and this will materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
if our products do not operate with a wide variety of hardware  software and operating systems used by our customers  our revenues would be harmed 
we currently serve a customer base that uses a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and operating systems 
for example  we have designed our products to work with databases and servers developed by  among others  microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  inc  sybase  inc  oracle corporation and ibm and with common enterprise software applications  such as microsoft office  wordperfect  lotus notes and novell groupwise 
we must continually modify and enhance our software products to keep pace with changes in computer hardware and software and database technology as well as emerging technical standards in the software industry 
we further believe that our application suite will gain broad market acceptance only if it can support a wide variety of hardware  software applications and systems 
if our products were unable to support a variety of these products  our business would be harmed 
additionally  customers could delay purchases of our software until they determine how our products will operate with these updated platforms or applications 
our products currently operate on various microsoft windows platforms  linux  ibm aix  ibm zlinux  hewlett packard ux and sun solaris operating environments 
if other platforms become more widely used  we could be required to convert our server application products to additional platforms 
we may not succeed in these efforts  and even if we do  potential customers may not choose to license our products 
in addition  our products are required to interoperate with leading content authoring tools and application servers 
we must continually modify and enhance our products to keep pace with changes in these applications and operating systems 
if our products were to be incompatible with a popular new operating system or business application  our business could be harmed 
also  uncertainties related to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications by vendors of operating systems  browsers  back office applications and other technology related applications  could harm our business 

table of contents our products may lack essential functionality if we are unable to obtain and maintain licenses to third party software and applications 
we rely on software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with our internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
the functionality of our software products  therefore  depends on our ability to integrate these third party technologies into our products 
furthermore  we may license additional software from third parties in the future to add functionality to our products 
if our efforts to integrate this third party software into our products are not successful  our customers may not license our products and our business will suffer 
in addition  we would be seriously harmed if the providers from whom we license software fail to continue to deliver and support reliable products  enhance their current products or respond to emerging industry standards 
moreover  the third party software may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
each of these license agreements may be renewed only with the other party s written consent 
the loss of  or inability to maintain or obtain licensed software  could result in shipment delays or reductions 
furthermore  we may be forced to limit the features available in our current or future product offerings 
either alternative could seriously harm our business and operating results 
our ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations 
in general  under section of the internal revenue code  a corporation that undergoes an ownership change is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre change net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
our existing net operating losses and credits may be subject to limitations arising from previous and future ownership changes under section of the internal revenue code 
additionally  net operating losses and credits related to companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to similar limitations or may be limited by the information we have retained following such acquisitions 
for these reasons  we may not be able to fully utilize a portion of the net operating losses and tax credits disclosed in our consolidated financial statements to offset future income 
this may result in a substantial increase to income tax expense in future periods 
difficulties in introducing new products and product upgrades and integrating new products with our existing products in a timely manner will make market acceptance of our products less likely 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and technology related enhancements  uncertain product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
we expect to add new functionality to our product offerings by internal development and possibly by acquisition 
content management and document management technology is more complex than most software and new products or product enhancements can require long development and testing periods 
any delays in developing and releasing new products or integrating new products with existing products could harm our business 
new products or upgrades may not be released according to schedule  may not be adequately integrated with existing products or may contain defects when released  resulting in adverse publicity  loss of sales  delay in market acceptance of our products or customer claims against us  any of which could harm our business 
if we do not develop  license or acquire new software products  adequately integrate them with existing products or deliver enhancements to existing products  on a timely and cost effective basis  our business will be harmed 
we might not be able to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  a loss of which could harm our business 
we depend upon our proprietary technology and rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions to protect it 
these protections may not be adequate 
also  it is possible that patents will not be issued from our currently pending applications or any future patent application we may file 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as effectively as the laws of the united states and we expect that it will become more difficult to monitor use of our products as we increase our international 
table of contents presence 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
any such resulting litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could materially and adversely affect our business  consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
further  third parties have claimed and may claim in the future that our products infringe the intellectual property of their products 
additionally  our license agreements require that we indemnify our customers for infringement claims made by third parties involving our intellectual property 
intellectual property litigation is inherently uncertain and  regardless of the ultimate outcome  could be costly and time consuming to defend or settle  cause us to cease making  licensing or using products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  require us to redesign or reengineer such products  if feasible  divert management s attention or resources  or cause product delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to obtain the right to use a necessary product  component or process  any of which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
charges to earnings resulting from the application of the purchase method of accounting and asset impairments may adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  which resulted in significant charges to our consolidated statement of operations in prior periods and  through ongoing amortization  will continue to generate charges that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
under the purchase method of accounting  we allocated the total estimated purchase price of these acquisitions to their net tangible assets  amortizable intangible assets  intangible assets with indefinite lives based on their fair values as of the closing date of these transactions and recorded the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill 
in some cases  a portion of the estimated purchase price may also be allocated to in process technology and expensed in the quarter in which the acquisition was completed 
we will incur additional depreciation and amortization expense over the useful lives of certain net tangible and intangible assets acquired and significant stock based compensation expense in connection with our acquisitions 
these depreciation and amortization charges could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
at december   we had million in net goodwill million at september  and million in net other intangible assets million at september   which we believe are recoverable 
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america require that we review the value of these acquired assets from time to time to determine whether the recorded values have been impaired and should be reduced 
we will continue to perform impairment assessments on an interim basis when indicators exist that suggest that our goodwill or intangible assets may be impaired 
these indicators include our market capitalization declining below our net book value or if we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price 
changes in the economy  the business in which we operate  a decline in the price of our stock and our own relative performance may result in indicators that our recorded asset values may be impaired 
if we determine there has been an impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  the carrying value of those assets will be written down to fair value  and a charge against operating results will be recorded in the period that the determination is made 
any impairment could have a material impact on our consolidated operating results and financial position  and could harm the trading price of our common stock

unresolved staff comments not applicable 
item properties our principal offices are located in a leased facility in san jose  california that will expire in july and consist of approximately  square feet 
the facility is used by our administrative  sales  marketing  engineering  customer support and services departments 
we also occupy other leased facilities in the united states  including offices in new york  new york  chicago  illinois  rockville  maryland  atlanta  georgia and austin  texas  which are primarily used for product development  sales and customer support 
leased facilities 
table of contents located in europe and asia pacific are used primarily for engineering  sales  marketing  customer support and services 
these leased facilities expire at various times through july over the past several years  we have instituted a series of facilities consolidation plans 
as a result  we identified facilities that were in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when these facilities were identified as excess and we ceased use of the facilities  we accrued the excess lease obligations as permitted in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
at december   we had accrued million for excess facilities 
we believe that our existing facilities  which have not been identified as excess  are adequate for our current needs 
item legal proceedings beginning in  interwoven and certain of our officers and directors and certain investment banking firms were named as defendants in a securities class action lawsuit brought in the southern district of new york 
this case is one of several hundred similar cases that have been consolidated into a single action in that court 
the case alleges misstatements and omissions concerning underwriting practices in connection with our public offerings 
the plaintiff seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
in october  our officers were dismissed without prejudice as defendants in the lawsuit 
in february  the district court denied a motion to dismiss by all parties 
although we believe that the plaintiffs claims have no merit  in july  we decided to participate in a proposed settlement to avoid the cost and distraction of continued litigation 
a settlement proposal was preliminarily approved by the district court 
however  in december  the court of appeals reversed the district court s finding that six focus cases could be certified as class actions 
in april  the court of appeals denied the plaintiffs petition for rehearing  but acknowledged that the district court might certify a more limited class 
at a june status conference  the district court terminated the proposed settlement as stipulated among the parties 
in august  plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in the six focus cases to test the sufficiency of their class allegations 
in november  defendants in the focus cases filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim 
all matters in the case  including any settlement proposal  await determination of this motion to dismiss and any motion by plaintiffs to certify a newly defined class 
if a new complaint is filed against us  we would continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
any liability we incur in connection with this lawsuit could materially harm our business and financial position and  even if we defend ourselves successfully  there is a risk that management s distraction in dealing with this lawsuit could harm our results 
in addition  in october  a lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the western district of washington by vanessa simmonds  captioned simmonds v 
bank of america corp  no 
 alleging that the underwriters of our initial public offering violated section b of the securities exchange act of  usc section p b  by engaging in short swing trades  and seeks disgorgement to interwoven of profits in amounts to be proven at trial from the underwriters 
the suit names interwoven as a nominal defendant  contains no claims against us  and seeks no relief from us 
on october   we were notified by the staff of the securities and exchange commission that no enforcement action is currently being recommended with respect to our historical stock option granting practices 
from time to time  in addition to those identified above  we are subject to legal proceedings  claims  investigations and proceedings in the ordinary course of business  including claims of alleged infringement of third party patents and other intellectual property rights  commercial  employment and other matters 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  we make a provision for a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and are adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other information and events pertaining to a particular matter 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
however  we believe that we have valid defenses with respect to the legal matters pending against us 
it is possible  nevertheless  that our consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations could be affected by the resolution of one or more of such contingencies

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations restatement of previously issued financial results introduction in the course of preparing for our year end audit  we initiated a voluntary review of our historical option granting procedures  initially focusing on several historical stock option grants which took place on dates when our stock price was at a low for a period of time around the grant date 
on january   we announced that a review of historical option grant procedures and related accounting was being undertaken by the audit committee of the board of directors  assisted by independent counsel  which in turn engaged an independent forensic accounting firm  to assist in our review 
all aspects of the review by the audit committee and its advisors have been supervised directly and solely by the audit committee 
one member of the audit committee  who was formerly a member of the compensation committee  did not participate in the audit committee review 
on november   we announced the preliminary results of the voluntary review  which were set forth in the current report on form k filed on that date 
the scope of the audit committee review was extensive  and included review of all stock option grants made during the period commencing with our initial public offering in october through june the review period 
the audit committee and its advisors considered all available evidence  including reviewing over  pages of electronic and hard copy documents and conducting over interviews of current and former employees  directors and advisors 
in december  the audit committee completed its review and presented its report to our board of directors 
the audit committee did not identify any evidence of intentional misconduct by our current or former directors  senior management or other employees and has concluded that no personnel actions were warranted as a result of its review 
the audit committee has determined that the appropriate measurement dates for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants differ from the previously recorded grant dates of those awards 
as a result of the review of its historical stock option practices  we analyzed our internal control over financial reporting  and determined that our historical grant procedures were not adequately designed to ensure the proper accounting for option grants and the contemporaneous documentation of grants 
the audit committee found these deficiencies occurred predominately during the period from through beginning in november  we implemented improved procedures  processes and systems to provide additional safeguards and greater internal control over our stock option granting and administration 
these improvements included issuing employee new hire  promotion and merit grants on the last trading day of each month 
also  prior to  we implemented improvements to procedures  processes and systems to provide additional safeguards and greater internal control over the stock option granting and administration function 
we believe these changes remediated the historical control deficiencies  and we did not identify any material weakness in our stock option grant processes or internal control over financial reporting as of december  in  the audit committee recommended enhancements to our stock option grant procedures to ensure that future granting actions are documented and accounted for properly and timely 
we have adopted all of the audit committee s recommendations  updating our equity compensation award policy that provides for the methodology of determining the timing and exercise price of all awards and related procedures 
based on the audit committee review  we recognized an additional million in non cash stock based compensation expense with respect to several granting actions  as described in more detail below 
as previously announced  we have concluded  upon the recommendation of the audit committee and management  that our previously filed annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q should not be relied upon 
accordingly  to correct errors related to accounting for stock based compensation expense  we have restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for years through and the unaudited quarterly financial statement information for the interim periods in to correct errors related to accounting for stock based compensation expense for periods prior to  we have recorded an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of december  the pre tax  non cash charges to be restated are an aggregate million of additional stock based compensation expense over the review period 
approximately million of the restated amounts apply to the consolidated statements of operations for the years through  and the remainder  which is applicable to prior years  has been recorded as a charge to accumulated deficit as of december  these adjustments have 
table of contents the effect of increasing net loss and  correspondingly  increasing accumulated deficit as reported in our historical consolidated financial statements 
in  these adjustments have the effect of increasing net income and decreasing accumulated deficit as reported in our historical consolidated financial statements 
however  we restated our consolidated balance sheet as of december  to reflect additional paid in capital  deferred stock based compensation and accumulated deficit balances as a result of previous period adjustments 
the net tax impact of the stock based compensation adjustments was insignificant for all periods 
our restatement also reflects previously unrecorded adjustments for the years ended december    and for support and services revenues and allowance for doubtful accounts expense not related to accounting for stock options that were previously deemed to be immaterial on an interim and annual basis to our consolidated financial statements 
none of the previously unrecorded adjustments individually or in aggregate exceeded of our previously reported net loss from operations or net loss in any annual period 
we have also restated our deferred tax assets as of december  reducing our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
upon review  we determined that such carryforwards did not properly consider the impact of various statutory limitations and as a result  deferred tax assets were overstated by approximately million 
this adjustment did not impact our consolidated statements of operations  balance sheets  stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss  and cash flows as our deferred tax assets are subject to valuation allowance 
our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards are more fully described in note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this annual report on form k reflects the restatement of our consolidated balance sheet as of december   the related consolidated statements of operations  stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss  and cash flows for each of and  and each of the quarters in and the condensed consolidated balance sheets for the first three quarters of this annual report on form k also reflects the restatement of selected consolidated financial data in item for the years through  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item for the years and we have not amended our previously filed annual reports on form k or quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by this restatement 
the financial information that has been previously filed or otherwise reported for these periods is superseded by the information in this annual report on form k  and the consolidated financial statements and related financial information contained in such previously filed reports should no longer be relied upon 
in addition  we have restated the pro forma expense under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  in note  summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements to include these adjustments for and all references to number of option shares  option exercise price and share price in this section have been adjusted for any stock splits 
stock option grant process historically  pursuant to our stock option plans  the board of directors has the authority to award stock option grants to employees  officers and directors  and the compensation committee has the authority to award stock option grants to employees and officers 
the board delegated authority to both the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer to award stock option grants to non officer employees 
pursuant to contractual agreements  we also issued stock option grants to non employees in consideration for services rendered to us 
accounting adjustments consistent with the applicable accounting literature and recent guidance from the staff of the securities and exchange commission regarding determination of appropriate measurement dates  we analyzed all available relevant evidence  including evidence developed through the audit committee review  including  for example  physical documents  electronic documents  underlying electronic data about documents  and information provided through interviews 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  we organized the option grants during the review period into categories based on the grant type and the processes by which the grant approval was finalized 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  we applied the appropriate accounting standards in effect at the time of grant to determine  for every grant within each category  the appropriate measurement date 
if the measurement 
table of contents date was not the recorded grant date  accounting adjustments were made as required resulting in stock based compensation expense and the related tax effects 
in some instances  the required adjustments did not result in any additional stock based compensation expense 
after accounting for forfeitures  we recognized additional stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the vesting terms for the affected grants 
no adjustments were required for the remaining grants 
the adjustments were determined by category as follows employee new hire  promotion and merit grants 
new hire  promotional and merit grants during the review period were made to non officer employees pursuant to the authority delegated to both the chief executive officer and chief financial officer by the board of directors 
based on the audit committee review  we determined that the measurement dates for of the new hire  promotion and merit granting actions during the review period should be revised 
for nine of these granting actions  we determined that insufficient contemporaneous documentation to support the recorded measurement date existed  so a later measurement date was selected based on the existence of adequate contemporaneous documentation to support the conclusion that the grant was fixed 
we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of million in relation to these nine granting actions using the intrinsic value method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
for the other three granting actions  we determined that measurement date criteria had been met on a date prior to the recorded grant date when the stock price was higher  resulting in variable accounting for these granting actions 
accordingly  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of million for these granting actions in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation 
corrections to employee new hire  promotion and merit grants 
in a small number of cases  corrections were made to employee new hire  promotion and merit grant 
these corrections amounted to approximately of total shares granted 
we determined that in substantially all instances  these corrections were for new hire  promotion and merit grants that were inadvertently left off the initial authorization document and for new hires whose shares on the initial authorization document did not correctly reflect the number of shares stated in their offer letters 
based on the audit committee review  we did not identify evidence indicating that the corrections were effected to achieve a lower exercise price for the grantee  nor did we identify a pattern of effecting corrections to achieve a lower exercise price 
we determined that the measurement dates for the individual option grants constituting these corrections should be revised to the date the correction was determined to be finalized 
accordingly  in addition to the granting actions described above  we recognized additional pre tax stock based compensation expense of million related to corrections to employee new hire  promotion and merit granting actions 
employee refresh grants 
we periodically made broad based equity compensation awards refresh grants to certain employees based on  such factors as  the employee s unvested equity ownership  total equity ownership  market conditions and the importance of the employee s expected contributions to interwoven 
employee refresh grants were issued pursuant to the authority delegated to the chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
based on the audit committee review  we determined that the measurement dates for three of the employee refresh granting actions should be revised because the number of shares to be allocated to each individual employee was not determined with finality by the recorded grant dates 
accordingly  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of million for these granting actions using the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb no 
we also determined that the measurement date criteria for one employee refresh granting action had been met on a date prior to the recorded grant date when the stock price was higher  resulting in variable accounting for this granting action 
accordingly  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of  for this granting action in accordance with fin no 
grants to officers and certain employees 
we granted stock options to newly hired officers and certain non officer members of management  employees who were promoted to officer positions or periodic refresh grants to officers and certain non officer members of management based on such factors as the employee s unvested equity ownership and total equity ownership  performance and market conditions 
grants to officers and certain non officer members of management were authorized by the board of directors or the compensation committee in thirty two granting actions during the review period 
based on the audit committee review  we determined that for four of these granting actions there was insufficient 
table of contents contemporaneous documentation to support the recorded measurement date 
accordingly  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of million for such granting actions using the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb no 
we also determined that for four granting actions the measurement date criteria were met on a date prior to the recorded grant date when the stock price was higher  resulting in variable accounting 
accordingly  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of  for such granting actions in accordance with fin no 
initial director grants 
under the equity incentive plan  each non employee director is automatically granted options to purchase shares of our common stock when he or she first joins the board 
based on the audit committee review  we determined that the measurement date for one automatic initial director grant should be revised because the measurement date criteria had been met on the date of the director s appointment to the board of directors  but the recorded grant date was the following day  when the stock price was lower 
we accounted for this grant as a variable award in accordance with fin no 
and  accordingly  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million for  which was reversed in due to fluctuation in our stock price 
this stock option grant was never exercised by the non employee director 
terminations 
we determined that the vesting of approximately  shares for eighteen employees was permitted after their respective stock option termination dates 
accordingly  as this additional vesting was considered a modification of the original terms of the respective option grants  we recognized a pre tax stock based compensation expense of  using the intrinsic value method of accounting under apb no 
and in accordance with fin no 
grants to non employees 
during the review period  grants were made to non employees in exchange for services as authorized in seven granting actions 
in connection with one such granting action  we concluded that the grant had not been accounted for in accordance emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and eitf issue no 
 accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employee 
accordingly  we determined that an additional compensation expense should be recorded and we recognized pre tax stock based compensation expense of  impact of judgments and interpretations on restatement values in determining the appropriate measurement dates for stock option awards in the review period  we considered all available relevant data  including data supplied by the audit committee and its advisors 
we evaluated this data and determined that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option granting actions 
we evaluated the evidence surrounding each grant at issue and determined whether there was conclusive or inconclusive evidence to support the measurement date 
the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each such grant were considered in selecting the measurement date 
in certain instances  the evidence was inconclusive and significant judgment was exercised in determining the appropriate measurement date for accounting purposes 
evidence was considered conclusive where it represented contemporaneous evidence of the date of approval of the option price and the number of option grants allocated to specific individuals 
evidence was considered inconclusive where it provided some support for a particular measurement date  but there was insufficient contemporaneous documentary evidence available to identify the specific date on which the granting action was complete 
in all cases  the earliest date when the terms of a grant were known with finality was determined to be the revised measurement date 
we identified four granting actions for employee new hire  promotion and merit grants  three corrections to granting actions for employee new hire  promotion and merit grants  one granting action for officers and certain employees grants and three granting actions for refresh grants for which the evidence was inconclusive and judgment was applied to determine the measurement date for accounting purposes 
for each of these eight granting actions and three corrections to granting actions  we evaluated all available relevant evidence to identify the range of dates in which the granting action may have been completed  and to determine the most appropriate measurement date within the range 
in some instances  we determined that the granting action was not complete by the recorded grant date and that the first date in the range was after the recorded measurement date  based on the totality of available evidence 
for seven granting actions and three corrections to granting actions  we determined that a revised measurement date was appropriate 
for one refresh grant to employees and executives  we determined that the recorded grant date was the most appropriate 
table of contents measurement date within the date range 
we made this determination after considering the totality of available evidence  including  but not limited to the following the board of directors met one day prior to the grant date and contemporaneous notes of that meeting indicate that the executive grants had not been finalized and that the board determined the employee and executive refresh grant should be made on the same date  the grant date was a friday and interviews indicated that our former chief executive officer typically endeavored to resolve compensation matters including option grants quickly so that they could be communicated to the recipients promptly thereafter  an employee all hands meeting held in connection with our earnings release was scheduled to take place two business days after the grant date and provided an opportunity to announce this refresh grant company wide  on the grant date  our closing stock price was approximately lower than the previous day  a decline which did not appear to relate to the release of any information by us and coincided with a general market downturn that same day  the authorization document for this refresh grant also included new hire grants  all of which were to persons who commenced employment prior to the grant date  and promotion grants  all of which related to promotions effective prior to the grant date  the grants were entered into stock administration system shortly after the grant date  beginning six business days after the grant date  and the absence of evidence to support a conclusion that the grant was finalized on a date other than the grant date 
for this refresh grant  there was a period of ten calendar days between the recorded measurement date and the date on which the process of entering the grants into the stock administration system commenced which is the last date the granting action could have been completed 
as further described in the paragraph and table below  we performed a sensitivity analysis with respect to this refresh grant  assessing the fluctuation in our stock price during the day range  and determined that if a measurement date had been selected based on the highest price of our common stock in this period  the total stock based compensation charge would have been approximately million 
for each of the eight granting actions and three corrections to granting actions described above  we performed a sensitivity analysis to quantify the potential divergence in stock based compensation expense 
in each instance  we evaluated all available relevant evidence to identify the range of dates in which the granting action may have been completed 
in some instances  we determined that the first date in the range should be after the recorded measurement date 
the fair market value of our common stock fluctuated throughout the review period and we computed the range of potential stock based compensation expense by recomputing the additional expense that would result from using the highest and lowest trading price of our common stock for the date range during which the evidence indicated the granting actions were completed 
based on our sensitivity analysis  we determined that if the highest price of our common stock during the relevant date ranges had been used as the revised measurement date  the total stock based compensation expense would have been approximately million higher 
had we used the lowest closing price of our common stock during the relevant date ranges  the total stock based compensation expense would have been decreased by approximately million 
the following table shows these incremental impacts by category of grant in thousands adjustments to pre tax incremental impact stock based at lowest at highest compensation closing closing expense price price employee new hire  promotion and merit grants corrections to employee new hire  promotion and merit grants employee refresh grants grants to officers and certain employees director grants terminations grants to non employees we believe that  in each instance  the proposed measurement dates for option awards that are being remeasured are the best alternative to the originally recorded grant date and comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in all material respects

the tax is a assessment on certain types of equity compensation award income  including gains on discounted options 
the state of california also assesses this tax 
because our employees were unaware of the tax at the time their options were granted and unaware that some options they received would subject them to these taxes  we are considering entering into arrangements with both the united states internal revenue service and the state of california to discharge these obligations  on behalf of our employees  directly with the taxing authorities for all periods through december  we also are considering paying the associated penalties and interest 
if we enter into these arrangements  the expense associated with discharging our employees a exposure for all periods through december  may be reflected in our consolidated financial statements if we make the decision to assume these obligations before december  in addition  we intend to provide our employees with the opportunity to remedy their outstanding stock options that are subject to potential penalties under a

overview incorporated in march  we are a provider of content management software solutions 
our software and services enable organizations to leverage content to drive business growth by maximizing online business performance  increasing collaboration and streamlining business processes both internally and externally 
today  over  enterprise and professional services organizations in countries worldwide have chosen our solutions 
we operate in a single segment  which is the design  development and marketing of content management software solutions 
our goal is to be the leading provider of content management software solutions 
we are focused on generating profitable and sustainable growth through internal research and development  licensing from third parties and acquisitions of businesses with complementary products and technologies 
total revenues for were million up from we experienced increases in over in each revenue category license  support  consulting and training 
these results reflected increased information technology spending  particularly spending on content management initiatives  in both domestic and international markets and the success of our strategic relationships 
our results may have also benefited from consolidation within the content management market  which we believe created uncertainty regarding some of our competitors and their products 

table of contents we license our software to businesses  professional services organizations  capital markets business and government agencies generally on a non exclusive and perpetual basis 
the growth in our software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of our software solutions 
software licenses revenues are also affected by long  unpredictable sales cycles  so they are difficult to forecast from period to period 
although our consolidated results of operations have improved in recent periods  our results were impacted in these periods by long product evaluation periods  protracted contract negotiations and multiple authorization requirements of our customers  all of which we believe are characteristic of the market for content management products and services 
customer support revenues are primarily influenced by the number and size of new support contracts sold in connection with software licenses and the renewal rate of existing support contracts 
customers that purchase software licenses usually purchase support contracts and renew their support contracts annually 
our support contracts entitle our customers to unspecified product upgrades and technical support during the support period  which is typically one year 
services revenues consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting 
these services tend to lag software license revenues since consulting services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses or in connection with software upgrades 
professional services are predominately billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues when the services are performed 
professional services revenues are influenced primarily by the number of professional services engagements sold in connection with software license sales and the customers use of third party services providers 
because our products are complex and involve a consultative sales model  our strategy is to market and sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force 
we look to augment those efforts through relationships with technology vendors  professional services firms  systems integrators and other strategic partners  which assist our direct sales force in obtaining customer leads and referrals 
approximately of our new customer license orders for the year ended december  were influenced by or co sold with our strategic partners and resellers 
in general  these partners and resellers perform the installation and integration  consulting and other services for the enterprises to which they resell our products  and we are not engaged by their customers for these services 
our sales efforts are targeted to senior executives and personnel who are responsible for managing an enterprise s information technology initiatives 
we generate demand for our products and services primarily through our direct sales force and strategic relationships 
our direct sales force is responsible for managing customer relationships and opportunities and is supported by product  marketing and service specialists 
in the rapidly changing and increasingly complex and competitive information technology environment  we believe product differentiation will be a key to market leadership 
thus  our strategy is to continually work to enhance and extend the features and functionality of our existing products and develop new and innovative solutions for our customers 
we have in the past and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we recorded income from operations in of million  as compared to operating losses of million in and million in we are focused on improving our operating margins by increasing our revenues and actively managing our expenses through improved productivity and utilization of economies of scale 
as a significant portion of our expenses are employee related  we manage our headcount from period to period 
we had employees worldwide at december  versus employees at december  and at december  we also look to improve our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs 
additionally  we pay close attention to other costs  including facilities and related expense  professional fees and promotional expenses  which are each significant components of our expense structure 
while we have been carefully managing our costs and expenses relating to the operation of our business  our general and administrative expenses have increased significantly during as compared to as we have incurred significant accounting  legal and other expenses relating to the audit committee s review of our historical stock option grant procedures and related accounting throughout 
table of contents our acquisition strategy is an important element of our overall business strategy 
we seek to identify acquisition opportunities that will enhance the features and functionality of our existing products  provide new products and technologies to sell to our installed base of customers  acquire additional customers that we can sell our existing products  or which facilitate entry into adjacent markets 
in evaluating these opportunities  we consider  among other items  both time to market of the technologies or products to be acquired and potential market share gains 
we have completed a number of acquisitions in the past  and we may acquire other technologies  products and companies in the future 
in recent years  we have added through acquisition products and solutions with digital asset management  collaborative document management  records management  content publishing  web optimization and capital markets vertical market capabilities 
the results of operations of these business combinations have been included prospectively from the closing dates of these transactions 
accordingly  our financial results are not directly comparable to those of the previous periods 
subsequent events we entered into an operating lease for our new headquarters facility in december and took possession of the new headquarters facility in march  whereupon we began construction of tenant improvements and moved into the new facility in july in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  we incurred additional rent expense of approximately  in the first seven months of while we were constructing tenant improvements on our new facility  which amount was in addition to the rent due on our former headquarters facility 
we made tenant improvements to our new facility of approximately million 
we also incurred moving costs of approximately  in on april   our board of directors appointed joseph l 
cowan as chief executive officer and as a member of our board of directors 
on april   our board of directors appointed roger j 
sippl to our board of directors 
in july  we entered into an amended line of credit agreement with a financial institution 
the amended line of credit provides for borrowings up to million until september  and up to million until july  the new line of credit provides for borrowings on terms similar to our previous line of credit and expires in july borrowings under the line of credit agreement are secured by cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the line of credit bears interest at the lower of below the bank s prime rate or above libor in effect on the first day of the term 
the line of credit primarily serves as collateral for letters of credit required by facilities leases 
there are no financial covenant requirements associated with the line of credit 
in november  we acquired optimost  a provider of software and services for website optimization 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash for all of the issued and outstanding membership units of optimost and vested options to purchase optimost membership units  and we assumed all of the outstanding unvested options to purchase optimost membership units

total revenues increased from million in to million in we believe that the increase in revenues in total revenue was attributable to higher customer spending in most of our geographic regions

license revenues increased from million in to million in we believe that the increase in license revenues for over was primarily due to higher license revenues from sales in most of our geographic regions  in particular europe and asia pacific 
license revenues increased from million in to million in we believe that the slight increase in license revenues for over was attributable to sales of newly introduced software solutions  including our records management and content publishing products  offset primarily by reduced license revenues from our european operations

support and service 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher support revenue from our larger installed base of new customers and existing customers purchasing support contracts and higher consulting revenues primarily related to increased sales of software licenses 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher support revenue from our larger installed base of customers purchasing support contracts and  to a lesser extent  higher consulting revenues 
we believe that our support renewal rates have not fluctuated significantly during these periods 
to the extent that our license revenues decline in the future  our support and service revenues may also decline 
specifically  a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting engagements 
additionally  since customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a slowing of customer support revenues 
however  since customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact will not be experienced for up to several months after a decline in license revenues 
in the future  customer support revenues may also be adversely impacted if customers fail to renew their support agreements or reduce the license software quantity under their support agreements

cost of license revenues includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and documentation  as well as costs of licensing third party software embedded in or sold with our software products and amortization of purchased technology associated with business combinations 
cost of license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to an increase in amortization of purchased technology associated with recent acquisitions offset by reduced amortization of certain intangible assets which have become fully amortized 
the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from to was also primarily due to the increase in amortization of purchased technology associated with our acquisitions 
based solely on acquisitions completed through december  and assuming no impairments  we expect the amortization of purchased technology classified as a cost of license revenues to be million in  million in and  in we expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to vary from period to period depending on the mix of software products sold  the extent to which third party software products are bundled with our products and the amount of overall license revenues  as many of the third party software products embedded with our software are under fixed fee arrangements 
further  the acquisition of optimost in november will increase the amortization of purchased technology

cost of support and service revenues represented  and of support and service revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of support and service revenues as a percentage of related revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting revenues as a percentage of total support and service revenues  as consulting revenues generally have lower gross margins than support revenues 
support and service headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
we realize lower gross profits on support and service revenues than on license revenues 
in addition  we may contract with outside consultants and system integrators to supplement the services we provide to customers  which increases our costs and further reduces gross profits 
as a result  if support and service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues or if we increase our use of third parties to provide such services  our gross profits will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected

the decreases in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of total revenues from to and from to were due primarily to cost control efforts and higher sales productivity 
sales and marketing headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs and the level of revenues  in particular license revenues  in each period

in  we entered into agreements to exit excess facilities in chicago  illinois and sunnyvale  california  revised our sublease assumptions associated with certain excess facilities and restructured certain of our european operations and our professional services organization 
as a result of these actions  we recorded charges of million associated with excess facilities and million related to workforce reductions  which included the termination of employees 
the expenses recorded for excess facilities were based on payments due over the remainder of the lease term and estimated operating costs offset by our estimate of future sublease income 
accordingly  our estimate of excess facilities costs may differ from actual results and such differences may result in additional charges or credits that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations

upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the short form method to calculate the tax effects of stock based compensation 
under the short form method  we use the cumulative effect of award grants to establish our hypothetical additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of the employee stock based compensation as if we had adopted the recognition provisions of sfas no

table of contents due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from january  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that we had recorded 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the with and without method for recognition of excess tax benefits related to stock option exercises 
as part of this election  we have also elected to exclude indirect benefits of stock option exercises from equity and record these benefits in our tax provision 
as of december   we have determined that  based upon our assessment of positive and negative evidence available  it was appropriate to continue to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
additionally  while we have net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards  the amounts of and benefits from these carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances

events which cause limitations in the amount of net operating loss and credit carryforwards that we may utilize in any one year include  but are not limited to  a cumulative ownership change as defined under sections and of the internal revenue code

our primary sources of cash are the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and typically proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchased under our employee stock purchase plan 
our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional fees and facilities and related costs 
we also use cash to purchase property and equipment  pay liabilities for excess facilities and to acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings 
a number of non cash items were charged to expense in  and these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  intangible assets and stock based compensation 
although these non cash items may increase or decrease in amount and therefore cause an associated increase or decrease in our future operating results  these items will have no corresponding impact on our operating cash flows

cash provided by financing activities was the results of proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  we made payments of million to retire a term loan assumed in the merger with imanage 
cash provided by financing activities is expected to decline significantly in as a result of the voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices  which suspended the exercise of common stock options and purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan since april we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investment objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or if a requirement for cash arises 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment as necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business  the leasing of a new office facility and our business outlook 
in  we purchased furniture and equipment and made leasehold improvements to our new headquarters facility in san jose  california 
we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
for example  in november  we acquired all the membership interests of optimost in exchange for million in cash and assumed certain unvested stock options 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional financing to complete future acquisitions 
we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and 
table of contents general market conditions 
since april employees were unable to exercise stock options or purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
accordingly  proceeds from such exercises and purchases will be lower in than bank borrowings 
we had a million line of credit available to us at december   which is secured by cash  cash equivalents and investments and is primarily used as collateral for letters of credit required by our facilities leases 
the line of credit bears interest at the lower of below the bank s prime rate adjusted from time to time or a fixed rate of above the libor in effect on the first day of the term 
there are no financial covenant requirements under this line of credit 
the line of credit agreement expired in july and we have entered into a new line of credit with the same financial institution

the restructuring and excess facilities accrual at december  includes minimum lease payments of million and estimated operating expenses of million offset by estimated sublease income of million and the present value discount of  recorded in accordance with sfas no 
we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements or with the input of third party real estate consultants and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 
in relation to our excess facilities  we may decide to negotiate and enter into lease termination agreements  if and when the circumstances are appropriate 
these lease termination agreements would likely require that a significant amount of the remaining future lease payments be paid at the time of execution of the agreement  but would release us from future lease payment obligations for the abandoned facility 
the timing of a lease termination agreement and the corresponding payment could materially affect our cash flows in the period of payment 
we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements associated with our facilities leases  which serve as required security deposits for such facilities 
these letters of credit expire at various times through at december   we had million outstanding under standby letters of credit  which are secured by cash

we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
financial risk management as we operate in a number of countries around the world  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
our primary exposures relate to non united states dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses in europe  asia pacific and canada 
we use foreign currency forward contracts as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
gains and losses on the changes in the fair values of the forward contracts are included in interest income and other  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases for our office facilities in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are often referred to as a form of off balance sheet financing 
as of december   we leased facilities under non cancelable operating leases expiring between and rent expense under operating leases for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of december  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future consolidated results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  income loss from operations and net income loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes as deemed appropriate under the circumstances 
we also discuss and review the suitability of these critical accounting policies and our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and our independent registered public accountants 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are of particular significance include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities costs  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from support  consulting and training services 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  for agreements that have multiple deliverables or multiple element arrangements eg  software products  services  support  etc  revenue is recognized for delivered elements only where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements 
our specific objective evidence of fair value for support is based on the renewal rate as stated in the agreement  so long as the rate is substantive 
our specific objective evidence of fair value for our other undelivered elements is based on the price of the element when sold separately 
once we have established the fair value of each of the undelivered elements  the dollar value of the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements first and the residual of the dollar value of the arrangement is then allocated to the delivered elements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of undelivered elements eg  support  consulting and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop no 
have been met 
for arrangements that include a support renewal rate that we determine is not substantive  all revenue for such arrangement is recognized ratably over the applicable support period 
under sop no 
 revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require additional services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
at the outset of our customer arrangements  if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
we use judgment to assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with each transaction 
if a portion of the license fee is due beyond our normal payments terms  which generally does not exceed days from the invoice date  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we use judgment to determine collectibility on a case by case basis  following analysis of the 
table of contents general payment history within the geographic sales region and a customer s years of operation  payment history and credit profile 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our review process  we recognize revenue as payments are received 
we periodically review collection patterns from our geographic locations to ensure historical collection results provide a reasonable basis for revenue recognition upon signing of an arrangement 
support and service revenues consist of professional services and support fees 
professional services consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting 
professional services are predominantly billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
support contracts are typically priced as a percentage of the product license fee and generally have a one year term 
services provided to customers under support contracts include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades when and if available 
revenues from advanced payments for support contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for accounts receivable considered uncollectible 
in estimating this allowance  our management specifically analyzes our accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
in general  our allowance for doubtful accounts consists of specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and an estimate  based on historical write offs  of the potential write offs for receivables not specifically reserved 
allowance for sales returns 
from time to time  a customer may return to us some or all of the software purchased 
while our software and reseller agreements generally do not provide for a specific right of return  we may accept product returns in certain circumstances 
to date  sales returns have been infrequent and not significant in relation to our total revenues 
we make an estimate of our expected returns and provide an allowance for sales returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
management specifically analyzes our revenue transactions  customer software installation patterns  historical return pattern  current economic trends and customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the remaining lease obligation 
in determining fair value of expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and of related exit costs  if any  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during the evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may be impaired 
excluding the facilities that are currently subleased  our excess facilities are being marketed for sublease and are currently unoccupied 
accordingly  our estimate of sublease income from vacant excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could require additional charges or credits that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable 
accounting for stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  in which compensation expense is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for all stock options granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
since we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  the consolidated results of operations have not been restated for prior periods 
at december   there was 
table of contents million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating expected life  stock price volatility and forfeiture rates 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions are shown in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on the history of grants  exercises and cancellations in our option database 
we also estimate the volatility based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price over the expected term of the option 
to the extent volatility of our stock price changes in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future would change  thereby increasing or decreasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
the risk free interest rates are based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we used an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing our expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate was based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise our estimates in the future  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
in the future  as empirical evidence regarding these input estimates is able to provide more directionally predictive results  we may change or refine our approach of deriving these input estimates 
these changes could impact our fair value of options granted in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we also review our net operating loss and credit carryforwards to assess the impact of statutory limitations 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance  when recorded  would be included in our consolidated statements of operations as a provision for benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
during  we assessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and based on earnings history and projected future taxable income  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be fully realized 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when those returns are filed and the impacts of the adjustments are known 
as a matter of course we may be audited by various taxing authorities and those audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution results in us owing additional taxes 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged by tax authorities and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances that affect the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies  however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the periods that assessments are resolved or when the statutes of limitations expire 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this allocation derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
we performed and completed the required annual impairment testing in the third quarter of upon completing our review  we determined that the carrying value of the recorded goodwill had not been impaired and no impairment charge was recorded 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
although we determined in that the recorded goodwill had not been impaired  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance may result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
accordingly  future changes in market capitalization could result in significantly different fair values of the reporting unit  which may impair goodwill 
we are also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired based on the factors mentioned above 
for example  if our market capitalization declines below our net book value or we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price  we will assess whether the goodwill has been impaired 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we do not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over estimated useful lives of between and months 
the amortization expense related to the intangible assets may be accelerated in the future if we reduce the estimated useful life of the intangible assets or determine that an impairment has occurred

table of contents interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
we invest in high quality credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the short term interest bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments with maturities greater than three months are available for sale and are considered to be short term investments
