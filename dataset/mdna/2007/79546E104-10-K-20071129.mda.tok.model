overview description of business we are the largest distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
we operate primarily through two business units  sally beauty supply and bsg 
through sally beauty supply and bsg  we operate a multi channel platform of  stores and supplied franchised stores in north america as well as selected european countries and japan  as of september  within bsg  we also have one of the largest networks of professional distributor sales consultants in north america  with approximately  professional distributor sales consultants who sell directly to salons and salon professionals 
we provide our customers with a wide variety of leading third party branded and exclusive label professional beauty supplies  including hair care products  styling appliances  skin and nail care products and other beauty items 
sally beauty supply stores target retail consumers and salon professionals  while bsg exclusively targets salons and salon professionals 
for the year ended september   our net sales and operating earnings were  million and million  respectively 
sally beauty supply is the largest open line distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us based on store count 
as of september   sally beauty supply operated  company owned retail stores and supplied franchised stores acquired in the salon services acquisition  which is discussed in greater detail below under recent acquisitions   of which are located in the us  and the remainder in the uk and certain other countries in europe  canada  puerto rico  mexico and japan 
sally beauty supply stores average  square feet and are primarily located in strip shopping centers 
the product selection in sally beauty supply stores ranges between  and  skus of beauty products  and includes products for hair care  nail care  beauty sundries and appliances  targeting retail consumers and salon professionals 
sally beauty supply stores carry leading third party brands such as clairol  revlon and conair  as well as an extensive selection of exclusive label merchandise 
for the year ended september   sally beauty supply s net sales and segment operating profit were  million and million  respectively  representing and of consolidated net sales and segment operating profit  respectively 
we believe bsg is the largest full service distributor of professional beauty supplies in the us as of september   bsg operated company owned stores  supplied franchised stores and had a sales force of approximately  professional distributor sales consultants selling exclusively to salons and salon professionals in us states and portions of canada  mexico and certain european countries 
bsg stores average  square feet and are primarily located in secondary strip shopping centers 
through bsg s large store base and sales force  bsg is able to access a significant portion of the highly fragmented us salon market 
the product selection in bsg stores  ranging between  and  skus of beauty products  includes hair care  nail care  beauty sundries and appliances targeting salons and salon professionals 
bsg carries leading professional beauty product brands  intended for use in salons and for resale by the salon to consumers 
certain bsg products are sold under exclusive distribution agreements with suppliers  whereby bsg is designated as the sole distributor for a product line within certain geographic territories 
for the year ended september   bsg s net sales and segment operating profit were million and million  respectively  representing and of consolidated net sales and segment operating profit  respectively 
business trends we operate within the large and growing us professional beauty supply industry 
potential growth in the industry is expected to be driven by increases in hair color  hair loss prevention and hair styling products 
we believe the following key industry trends and characteristics will influence our business going forward high level of customer fragmentation 
the us salon market is highly fragmented with over  salons 
given the fragmented and small scale nature of the salon industry  we believe that salon operators will continue to depend on full service exclusive distributors and open line channels for a majority of their beauty supply purchases 
growth in booth renting 
booth renters are responsible for purchasing their own supplies 
historically  booth renters have significantly increased as a percentage of total salon professionals and we expect this trend to continue 
given their smaller individual purchases and relative lack of financial resources  booth renters are likely to be dependent on frequent trips to professional beauty supply stores  like bsg and sally beauty supply 
increasing use of exclusive label products 
we offer a broad range of private label and control label products  which we generally refer to collectively as exclusive label products 
exclusive label products are brands for which we own or license the trademark and in some instances the formula 
control label products are brands that are owned by the manufacturer  but for which we have been granted sole distribution rights 
generally  our exclusive label products have higher gross margins than the leading third party branded products and we believe this area offers potential growth 
frequent re stocking needs 
salon professionals primarily rely on just in time inventory due to capital constraints and a lack of warehouse and shelf space at salons 
these factors are key to driving demand for conveniently located professional beauty supply stores 
continuing consolidation 
there is continuing consolidation among professional beauty product distributors and professional beauty product manufacturers 
we plan to continue to examine ways in which we can benefit from this trend  including reviewing opportunities to shift business from competitive distributors to the bsg network as well as seeking opportunistic value added acquisitions 
we believe that suppliers are increasingly likely to focus on larger distributors and retailers with broader scale and retail footprint 
we also believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on this trend as well as participate in the ongoing consolidation at the distributor retail level 
however  changes often occur in our relationships with suppliers that can materially affect the net sales and operating earnings of our business segments 
consolidation among suppliers could exacerbate the effects of these relationship changes and could increase pricing pressures 
for example  as we announced in december  our largest supplier  l oreal  has moved a material amount of revenue out of the bsg nationwide distribution network and into competitive regional distribution networks 
more recently  l oreal has also announced the acquisition of distributors competitive with bsg in the southeastern and west coast of the us in addition  l oreal has announced the acquisition of a supplier pureology that does not currently do business with bsg 
if l oreal acquired another supplier that conducts significant business with bsg  we could lose that revenue as well 
as a result  l oreal is entering into direct competition with bsg and there can be no assurance that there will not be further revenue losses over time at bsg  due to potential losses of additional l oreal related products as well as from the increased competition from l oreal affiliated distribution networks 
high level of competition 
sally beauty supply competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail outlets  including local and regional open line beauty supply stores  professional only beauty supply stores  salons  mass merchandisers  drug stores and supermarkets  as well as sellers on the internet and salons retailing hair care items 
bsg competes with other domestic and international beauty product wholesale and retail suppliers and manufacturers selling professional beauty products directly to salons and individual salon professionals 
we also face competition from authorized and unauthorized retailers and internet sites offering professional salon only products 
the increasing availability of unauthorized professional salon products in large format retail stores such as drug stores  grocery stores and others could have a negative impact on our business 
favorable demographic and consumer trends 
the aging baby boomer population is expected to drive future growth in professional beauty supply sales through an increase in the usage of hair color and hair loss products 
additionally  continuously changing fashion related trends that drive new hair styles are expected to result in continued demand for hair styling products 
changes in consumer tastes and fashion trends can have an impact on our financial performance 
our continued success depends in large part on our ability to anticipate  gauge and react in a timely and effective manner to changes in consumer spending patterns and preferences for beauty products 
if we are unable to anticipate and respond to trends in the market for beauty products and changing consumer demands  our business could suffer 
controlling expenses 
another important aspect of our business is our ability to control costs  especially in our bsg business by right sizing the business including some targeted reductions in force and maximizing the efficiency of our structure 
in response to the loss of l oreal related revenue discussed below  bsg made certain changes with its distributor sales consultants 
bsg s sales force was reduced and the remaining affected distributor sales consultants were offered certain compensation related incentives to stay with bsg as bsg seeks to replace lost l oreal revenue 
bsg has substantially completed a store re branding project that repositioned all of its north american company owned stores under a common name and store identity  cosmoprof 
this project is expected to provide brand consistency  save on advertising and promotional costs and allow for a more focused marketing strategy 
further  we continue to study our distribution function as we seek to rationalize our infrastructure 
during fiscal year  we began implementing a two year  million capital spending program to consolidate warehouses and reduce administrative expenses related to bsg s distribution network optimization program 
we currently believe that this plan could produce significant annual expense savings within the next two years 
relationships with suppliers 
we do not manufacture the brand name or exclusive label products we sell  and instead purchase our products from manufacturers 
we depend upon a limited number of manufacturers for a significant percentage of the products we sell  and our relationships with these suppliers change often 
please see the next section for more information on this trend 
relationships with suppliers most of the net sales of sally beauty supply and bsg are generated through retail stores with respect to the sally beauty supply business  and both professional only stores and professional distribution sales consultants with respect to the bsg business 
in addition  bsg has a number of franchisees located primarily in the south and southwestern portions of the us and in mexico  which buy products directly from bsg for resale in their assigned territories 
a very small percentage of sales are generated through franchisees or sub distributors primarily in europe  which also buy products directly from sally beauty supply or bsg for resale 
sally beauty supply bsg and their suppliers are dependent on each other for the distribution of beauty products 
as is typical in distribution businesses  these relationships are subject to change from time to time including the expansion or loss of distribution rights in various geographies and the addition or loss of products lines 
changes in our relationships with suppliers occur often  and could positively or negatively impact our net sales and operating profits 
for example  during the second quarter of  farouk systems  inc  or farouk systems  terminated its distribution agreement with us 
subsequently  effective july  bsg stores and professional distributor sales consultants were once again given approval to distribute farouk systems products  with an expanded distribution area 
on december   we announced that i bsg  other than its armstrong mccall division  would not retain its rights to distribute the professional products of l oreal through its distributor sales consultants effective january   with exclusivity ending december  or in its stores on an exclusive basis effective january  in those geographic areas within the us in which bsg had distribution rights  and ii bsg s armstrong mccall division would not retain the rights to distribute redken professional products through its franchises 
in an effort to replace these rights  bsg entered into long term agreements with l oreal under which  as of january   bsg had non exclusive rights to distribute the same l oreal professional products in its stores that it previously had exclusive rights to in its stores and through its sales consultants 
armstrong mccall retained its exclusive rights to distribute matrix professional products in its territories 
we plan to mitigate the negative effects resulting from unfavorable changes in our relationships with suppliers  such as l oreal  by taking the following steps i adding new products to replace lines with our distributor sales consultants  ii adding new product lines to our bsg stores  iii expanding existing product lines into new territories  and iv managing costs to maximize the efficiency of the bsg structure in fiscal year we undertook a right sizing of the bsg business  including some targeted reductions in force 
although we are focused on developing new revenue and cost management initiatives  there can be no assurance that our efforts will partially or completely offset the loss of these distribution rights 
in addition  bsg s loss of distribution rights through its distributor sales consultants  as well as the loss of exclusive rights to distribute l oreal products in its stores  has resulted in margin pressure on bsg s remaining l oreal revenues 
see risk factors we depend upon manufacturers who may be unable to provide products of adequate quality or who may be unwilling to continue to supply products to us 
regarding other suppliers  bsg continues to expand the p g professional care product lines including wella  sebastian and graham webb into additional geographies for bsg stores and distributor sales consultants 
additionally  during fiscal year  our expansion of the bsg segment included the acquisition of certain assets  and the award of distribution rights  which allow us to distribute goldwell kms products and paul mitchell products in various markets  as well as a number of other brands 
we expect to gain certain other distribution rights over time through either further awards  or by acquisitions of existing distributors 
recent acquisitions on february   we entered into and completed an agreement for the sale and purchase of the entire issued share capital of chapelton limited  or the agreement  a private company limited by shares and incorporated in scotland  which we refer to as salon services  by and among ogee limited  an indirect subsidiary of ours  and the registered shareholders of salon services 
this acquisition provided the sally beauty supply segment a strong european presence 
pursuant to the agreement  we acquired all of the issued share capital of salon services for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million 
certain of our subsidiaries financed the purchase price through a draw down of approximately million under our abl facility 
in addition  we extinguished approximately million of salon services debt 
salon services  through its direct and indirect subsidiaries including salon services hair and beauty supplies ltd  supplies professional hair and beauty products primarily to salon and spa operators and independent hair and beauty professionals in the uk  germany  ireland  spain and norway 
in addition  during june  we acquired salon success  a uk based distributor of professional beauty products in order to expand bsg s presence in the uk and expand the geographic area served by bsg into other portions of europe 
this acquisition enabled bsg to enter new markets in europe  including the uk  spain and the netherlands and to expand its operations in florida 
the total purchase price as of september   was approximately million 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  additional consideration of up to million  plus interest  may be paid over the three year period following the closing of the acquisition based on sales to a specific customer 
as of september   approximately million has been paid pursuant to this agreement 
our separation from alberto culver our business historically constituted two operating segments within the consolidated financial statements of alberto culver 
on november   we separated from alberto culver  pursuant to the investment agreement 
as a result i we own and operate the sally beauty supply and bsg distribution businesses that were owned and operated by alberto culver prior to the separation transactions  ii at the closing of the separation transactions  the stockholders of alberto culver prior thereto became the beneficial owners of approximately of our outstanding common stock on an undiluted basis and the cdr investors  who in the aggregate invested million in us  received an equity interest representing approximately of our outstanding common stock on an undiluted basis  and iii alberto culver continues to own and operate its consumer products business 
in addition  in connection with the separation transactions sally holdings and certain of our other subsidiaries incurred approximately  million of indebtedness  including i  million by drawing on its term loans  ii million by drawing on its abl facility  and iii million from the issuance of million of senior notes and million of senior subordinated notes  we used approximately  million  a substantial portion of the proceeds of the investment by the cdr investors and the debt incurrence  to pay a per share special cash dividend to holders of record of our common stock  who were alberto culver shareholders as of the record date for the separation transactions 
pursuant to the investment agreement  we paid a transaction fee of million to clayton  dubilier rice  inc  the manager of both clayton  dubilier rice fund vii  lp  the sole member of cdrs  and parallel fund  as well as approximately million to cdrs in merger and transaction expenses incurred in connection with its investment in us  and the separation transactions 
pursuant to the investment agreement  we also paid approximately to alberto culver for its expenses incurred in connection with the separation transactions 
we also paid approximately million in fees for the debt financing incurred in connection with the separation transactions 
on november   pursuant to the terms of a separation agreement entered into in connection with the separation transactions  all cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of us and our subsidiaries was transferred to alberto culver other than million  equal to the sum of million plus an additional amount equal to million 
the additional amount is the sum of i an estimate of the amount needed to cover certain income taxes as specified in a tax allocation agreement entered into in connection with the separation transactions  ii an amount determined pursuant to a formula intended to reflect the limitations placed on the number of shares of sally beauty that cdrs may acquire in order not to jeopardize the intended tax free nature of the share distribution  and iii unpaid balances on certain specified liabilities of us  minus other specified transaction costs

renzulli  our former chairman  terminated his employment with alberto culver and us 
as a result  we provided mr

we treated the separation transactions as though they constituted a change in control for all employees and directors under our equity and incentive compensation plans  and as a change in control for our employees under alberto culver s deferred compensation plan 
as a result  in accordance with the terms of these plans  all outstanding stock options and restricted shares of alberto culver  including those held by our employees  became fully vested upon completion of the separation transactions

description of sales and expenses net sales 
our net sales consist primarily of the following sally beauty supply 
sally beauty supply generates net sales primarily by selling products through its stores to both professional and retail customers 
sally beauty supply sells hair care  hair color  skin and nail care products  electrical appliances and other beauty related accessories 
because approximately of our us sally beauty supply product sales come from exclusive or control label brands  most of these same products are generally not sold in most other retail stores and are not sold in our bsg business 
various factors influence sally beauty supply s net sales including local competition  product assortment and availability  price  hours of operation and marketing and promotional activity 
sally beauty supply s product assortment and sales are generally not seasonal in nature 
beauty systems group 
bsg generates net sales by selling products to salon professionals and independent stylists through company owned and franchised stores as well as through its network of professional distributor sales consultants 
bsg sells hair care  hair color products  skin and nail care products  electrical appliances and other beauty related accessories 
these products are not sold directly to the general public and are generally not the same products as those sold in our sally beauty supply stores 
various factors influence bsg s net sales  including product breadth and availability  competitive activity  relationships with suppliers  new product introductions and price 
bsg s product assortment and sales are generally not seasonal in nature 
cost of products sold and distribution expenses 
cost of products sold and distribution expenses consist of the cost to purchase merchandise from suppliers  less rebates and allowances  and certain overhead expenses including purchasing costs  freight from distribution centers to stores and handling costs in the distribution centers 
cost of products sold and distribution expenses are also affected by store inventory shrinkage  which represents products that are lost  stolen or damaged at the store level 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  commissions paid to professional distributor sales consultants  benefits  utilities  property maintenance  advertising  rent  insurance  freight and distribution expenses for delivery to customers  administrative costs and costs associated with our corporate support center 
sales based service fee 
prior to the separation transactions  we were charged a sales based service fee under the consulting  business development and advisory services agreement between certain of our subsidiaries and alberto culver 
in conjunction with the separation transactions  the arrangements giving rise to this fee from alberto culver were terminated and the related charges have ceased 
we believe that had we been a stand alone company  we would have not incurred a comparable expense 
transaction expenses 
for fiscal year  transaction expenses are costs associated with the separation transactions and are primarily payments to alberto culver as defined in the separation agreements 
in addition  we recognized severance costs for two executives and certain professional fees related to the separation transactions 
for fiscal year  transaction expenses are related to the termination of the agreement with regis that called for us to merge with a subsidiary of regis in a tax free transaction 
this proposed transaction was terminated in april and we expensed approximately million million after taxes in fees associated with the termination 
net interest expense 
net interest expense includes the amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  and is stated net of interest income 
for the fiscal year  net interest expense is primarily associated with debt incurred in connection with the separation transactions 
prior to the separation transactions  net interest expense was primarily attributable to notes with affiliates 
comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year compared to  million for the same period in this increase was primarily the result of comparable store sales growth of  the addition of sally beauty supply and bsg stores during fiscal year  and the acquisitions of salon services and salon success 
salon services  which was acquired during the second quarter of  contributed approximately million of incremental revenue  and salon success  which was acquired during the third quarter of  contributed approximately million of incremental revenue during fiscal year sally beauty supply 
net sales for sally beauty supply increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year compared to  million for the same period in net sales increased primarily due to a increase resulting from the salon services acquisition  which contributed million of net sales during fiscal year  the opening of net new stores over the last months excluding acquisitions and a comparable store sales growth of  which includes a decline in same store number of transactions 
in addition  the effect of exchange rates contributed million or an increase in sales of 
beauty systems group 
net sales for bsg decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in net sales for fiscal year were impacted by changes in the l oreal distribution agreement  resulting in the loss of approximately million of sales of l oreal products compared to fiscal year bsg also experienced a decline in sales at its franchised based business 
these declines were mostly offset by comparable store sales growth of and incremental sales of million resulting from the acquisition of salon success  an increase in sales of non l oreal brands and the addition of new stores over the last months excluding acquisitions and the effect of exchange rates 
the effect of exchange rates contributed approximately million or an increase in sales of approximately gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year compared to  million for the same period in consolidated gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal year compared to for the prior year period 
gross profit margins increased slightly during fiscal year due to higher gross profit margins at sally beauty supply  partially offset by lower gross profit margins at bsg 
gross profit margins for sally beauty supply increased  in part  because of a continued increase in sales of higher margin exclusive label products  margin increases on certain products  and continued favorable changes in customer mix  partially offset by an increased weighting of revenues from our international business where gross margins are typically lower than in the us gross profit margins for bsg declined  in part  because of the loss of the exclusive distributorship rights for l oreal products resulting in margin pressure on the remaining l oreal sales  the growth in sales of lower margin products to replace the lost l oreal sales  and margin declines at bsg s franchise based business 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were for fiscal year compared to for the prior year period 
the increase in expense is partly attributable to selling and administrative costs associated with the unit growth of the sally beauty supply and bsg businesses  costs associated with the realignment of our bsg business  acquisitions  and additional expenses at our corporate support center 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year includes million of share based compensation expense  compared to million for fiscal year share based compensation expense for fiscal year includes million of accelerated expenses related to certain retirement eligible employees who are eligible to continue vesting awards upon retirement under the terms of the omnibus incentive plan  and million of expenses related to early vesting of equity awards as a result of the separation transactions 
depreciation and amortization consolidated depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in  primarily due to the addition of assets associated with acquisitions and the unit growth of the sally beauty supply and bsg businesses 
sales based service fee charged by alberto culver the sales based service fee charged to us by alberto culver declined to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to the cancellation of the consulting  business development and advisory services agreement between certain of our subsidiaries and alberto culver in connection with the separation transactions 
other expenses during fiscal year we recorded million in expenses related to the separation transactions 
these expenses were for fees allocated to us by alberto culver and for the severance payments to mr 
renzulli  former chairman of sally holdings  inc  as called for in the separation agreement from alberto culver  of approximately million  as well as severance payments to mr 
robinson  our former chief financial officer and treasurer  prior to his retirement  of approximately million  and for other professional fees 
during fiscal year  we recorded million in expenses related to the terminated transaction with regis 
operating earnings consolidated operating earnings increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in operating earnings  as a percentage of net sales  were for fiscal year compared to for the same period in the increase in consolidated operating earnings was primarily due to the cancellation of the consulting  business development and advisory services agreement between certain of our subsidiaries and alberto culver in connection with the separation transactions  and the expenses incurred as a result of the separation transactions being less than the expenses we recognized in related to the proposed but terminated regis transaction 
we do not allocate these expenses to our operating segments and these expenses are not reflected in the segment operating earnings of sally beauty supply and bsg discussed below 
sally beauty supply 
sally beauty supply s segment operating earnings increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in segment operating earnings  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal year compared to for the same period in sally beauty supply operating earnings were positively impacted by additional earnings from the salon services acquisition  growth in the number of stores  same store sales increases along with sales growth in certain merchandise categories  operating expense controls  as well as a gross margin improvement 
operating earnings margins improvements at our sally beauty supply us based business were partially offset by a greater weighing of international based earnings that typically carry lower operating earnings margins 
beauty systems group 
bsg s segment operating earnings decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in  in part  due to an increase of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses related to the closure of a warehouse and expenses related to the realignment of its sales force  including expenditures related to the retention of certain professional distributor sales consultants  while also experiencing lower gross profit margins on a decreased sales volume 
sales volumes declined primarily as a result of certain l oreal sales as discussed earlier

comparison of fiscal years ended september  and net sales consolidated net sales increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year compared to  million for the same period in this increase was primarily the result of comparable store sales growth of  the inclusion of a full reporting period for cosmoprof for fiscal year which resulted in a increase in net sales  the acquisition of salon success  which resulted in a increase in net sales and the opening of new stores  including net new stores opened during fiscal year cosmoprof was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal year and salon success was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal year sally beauty supply 
net sales for sally beauty supply increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year compared to  million for the same period in net sales increased primarily due to a increase resulting from the opening of new stores  including net new stores opened during fiscal year  and comparable store sales growth of

the remaining increase was principally due to a increase in net sales resulting from the opening of new stores  including net new stores opened during fiscal year including franchised stores  comparable store sales growth of and a positive impact from foreign exchange rates 
these increases for fiscal year were partially offset by lower sales by bsg s professional distributor sales consultants as salon professionals shifted some of their purchases from sales consultants to bsg stores 
gross profit consolidated gross profit increased million  or  to  million for fiscal year compared to  million for the same period in consolidated gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for the year ended september  compared to for the prior year period 
the gross profit margin improvement is primarily attributable to improved vendor pricing  an increase in the percentage of sales made to retail customers since such sales are at a higher gross profit margin than those made to salons and salon professionals and with an increase in sales of exclusive label products 
selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in these expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were for fiscal year compared to for the prior year period

sales based service fee charged by alberto culver the sales based service fee charged to us by alberto culver increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  which is consistent with the increase in net sales 
the consulting  business development and advisory services agreement between certain of our subsidiaries and alberto culver was subsequently cancelled in fiscal year in connection with the separation transactions 
other expenses other expenses for fiscal year include expenses related to the terminated transaction with regis 
in accordance with the terms of the related transaction agreement  alberto culver allocated to our business million in expenses for fiscal year representing our share of the termination fee paid to regis as well as legal and other professional fees and expenses related to the transaction

operating earnings consolidated operating earnings decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to for the same period in operating earnings  as a percentage of net sales  were for fiscal year compared to for the same period in the decrease in consolidated operating earnings was primarily due to the allocation to our business by alberto culver of million of expenses related to the terminated regis transaction 
we do not allocate these expenses to our operating segments and these expenses are not reflected in the segment operating profit of sally beauty supply and bsg discussed below 
sally beauty supply 
as a result of the foregoing  sally beauty supply s segment operating profit increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in segment operating profit  as a percentage of net sales  was for fiscal year compared to for the same period in beauty systems group

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes was million during fiscal year compared to million for the same period of the decreased provision for income taxes for fiscal year was principally the result of lower earnings before provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in fiscal year and in fiscal year the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily related to a change in the mix of earnings from foreign operations and higher state income taxes 
net earnings as a result of the foregoing  consolidated net earnings decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for the same period in net earnings  as a percentage of net sales  were for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year net earnings for fiscal year were impacted by expenses related to the terminated spin merge transaction with regis and share based compensation expense recognized pursuant to sfas r 
net earnings for fiscal year were impacted by the non cash charge from alberto culver s conversion to one class of common stock and an adjustment related to lease accounting 
financial condition september  compared to september  working capital current assets less current liabilities at september  was million compared to million at september   representing a decrease of million 
the resulting ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at september  compared to to at september  the decrease in current assets at september  was primarily impacted by a million reduction in cash  which was primarily attributable to the payment of fees associated with the separation transactions  distributions to alberto culver made in connection with the separation transactions and a million decline in inventory levels  partially offset by an increase in trade accounts receivable  the prepayment of certain expenses and deferred income tax assets 
the increase in current liabilities at september  was primarily impacted by the addition of the current maturities of long term debt  which was incurred in connection with the separation transactions  of approximately million  and accrued interest thereon of million 
in addition  we had an increase in accrued operating expenses and income taxes 
a reduction in working capital is part of our business strategy to minimize the amount of capital employed in the business while maximizing the related operating profits 
net property and equipment increased million to million at september   compared to million at september  of this increase  approximately million was attributable to acquisitions  with the remainder due primarily to the opening of new stores and remodeling of existing facilities 
goodwill increased million to million at september   compared to million at september   primarily due to the acquisition of salon services and the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
intangible assets increased million to million at september   compared to million at september   primarily due to the acquisition of salon services 
other assets increased million to million at september   compared to million at september   primarily due to the costs associated with the issuance of debt  which will be amortized as interest expense over the term of the debt 
accrued expenses increased million to million at september   compared to million at september  this increase was primarily a result of million of interest expense related to the new debt incurred in connection with the separation transactions  and an increase in operating expenses and legal and other professional fees 
deferred income tax liabilities increased million to million at september   compared to million at september  this increase was primarily due to differences between depreciation included for tax returns versus depreciation included in our statements of earnings  and purchase accounting adjustments 
stock options subject to redemption declined to million at september   compared to million as of september   primarily due to exercises of these options 
total stockholders equity decreased as a result of the special dividend payment of approximately  million called for under the separation agreement from alberto culver 
the proceeds from the equity contribution of million from cdrs and the proceeds from the debt were used to issue this dividend 
in addition  retained earnings decreased by million as a result of settlement of the inter company agreement with alberto culver  treated as a dividend 
additional paid in capital increased as a result of the equity contribution made by clayton  dubilier rice  inc in connection with the separation transactions  partially offset by costs of approximately million associated with the raising of such equity 
accumulated other comprehensive income foreign currency translation increased million to million at september   compared to million at september  the increase was primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar versus certain foreign currencies  primarily the british pound and canadian dollar 
liquidity and capital resources we broadly define liquidity as our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments 
in addition  liquidity includes the ability to obtain appropriate debt and equity financing and to convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financial objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist of current or potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives and meeting debt service commitments 
following the completion of the separation transactions  we are highly leveraged and a substantial portion of our liquidity needs will arise from debt service on indebtedness incurred in connection with the separation transactions and from funding the costs of operations  working capital and capital expenditures 
as a holding company  we depend on our subsidiaries  including sally holdings  to distribute funds to us so that we may pay our obligations and expenses 
the ability of our subsidiaries to make such distributions will be subject to their operating results  cash requirements and financial condition and their compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to their existing or future indebtedness  including covenants restricting sally holdings ability to pay dividends to us 
in addition  under delaware law  the ability of each of sally holdings and its subsidiaries to make distributions to us will be limited to the extent i of its surplus  or if there is no surplus  of its net earnings for the fiscal year in which the distribution is declared and or the preceding fiscal year  if such subsidiary is a corporation  or ii the fair value of its assets exceeds its liabilities  in the case of sally holdings or such subsidiary that is a limited liability company 
if  as a consequence of these limitations  we cannot receive sufficient distributions from our subsidiaries  we may not be able to meet our obligations to fund general corporate expenses 
see risk factors risks relating to our business  and risks relating to our substantial indebtedness 
our ability to obtain liquidity from the issuance of additional public or private equity is severely limited until at least two years have passed from the completion of the separation transactions  or november  because issuance of our common stock may cause the alberto culver share distribution to be taxable to us and our stockholders under section e of the code 
see risk factors risks relating to the tax treatment of our separation from alberto culver and relating to our largest stockholder 
based upon the current level of operations and anticipated growth  we anticipate that existing cash balances  funds generated by operations and funds available under the abl facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and to finance capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  over the next months 
there can be no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  that anticipated net sales growth and operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available under the abl facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in addition  our ability to meet our debt service obligations and liquidity needs are subject to certain risks  which include  but are not limited to  restrictions on our ability to issue public or private equity for at least two years after the separation transactions  increases in competitive activity  the loss of key suppliers  rising interest rates  the loss of key personnel  the ability to execute our business strategy and general economic conditions

historical cash flow our primary source of cash has been from funds provided by operating activities and  for fiscal year  from borrowings 
the primary uses of cash during the past three years were for acquisitions and capital expenditures and  for fiscal year  for the cash dividend paid in connection with the separation transactions 
the following table shows our sources and uses of funds for the fiscal years ended september   and in thousands year ended september  cash provided by operating activities   cash used by investing activities    cash provided used by financing activities   effect of foreign exchange rates   net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year increased by million to million  compared to million during fiscal year the increase was primarily due to a reduction in cash used for inventory as we reduced our inventory levels  partially offset by lower net earnings due to interest expense 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year increased by million to million  compared to million during fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the timing of payments of amounts due to alberto culver and to vendors and improved collections of other receivable balances  partially offset by lower net earnings adjusted for non cash items and for increased amounts paid for inventories 
cash used by investing activities net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year increased by million to million  compared to million during fiscal year  primarily due to the acquisition of salon services  and capital expenditures for new stores and remodels of existing facilities 
included in fiscal year is million paid to exercise an operating lease purchase option of a warehouse building that was subsequently sold for million  which proceeds are included in the proceeds from sale of property and equipment 
net cash used by investing activities during fiscal year decreased by million to million  compared to million in fiscal year  primarily due to lower cash acquisition costs and capital expenditures in fiscal year cash used for the acquisition of salon success during fiscal year was substantially less than the cash used for the acquisition of cosmoprof in the prior year period 
capital expenditures were million for fiscal year compared to million during the prior year period with the higher amount in principally related to the new corporate support facility in denton  texas 
cash provided used by financing activities net cash used by financing activities during fiscal year increased by million to million  compared to million during fiscal year  primarily due to distributions to alberto culver and costs associated with the separation transactions  including debt issuance costs and special cash dividend paid  partially offset by equity contributions and proceeds from the issuance of debt 
net cash used by financing activities was million during fiscal year compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal year net cash provided used by financing activities was negatively impacted in fiscal year by the net repayment of million of notes with affiliated companies and the change in the book cash overdraft balance 
for fiscal year  sally holdings borrowed million from affiliated companies  which was offset by repayments of million  and million under alberto culver s revolving credit facility  which was offset by repayments of million 
credit facilities in connection with the separation transactions  we  through our subsidiaries i entered into the term loans in an aggregate amount of  million  ii issued senior notes in an aggregate amount of million and senior subordinated notes in an aggregate amount of million the notes  and iii entered into the million abl facility  subject to borrowing base limitations  of which approximately million was drawn at closing  which resulted in the incurrence of aggregate indebtedness in connection with the separation transactions of approximately  million 
proceeds from this new debt and the million equity investment by the cdr investors were used to pay a per share cash dividend to holders of record of alberto culver shares as of the record date for the separation transactions 
see risk factors risks relating to our substantial indebtedness 
as of september   there were outstanding borrowings of  million under the term loans  at a weighted average interest rate of  and outstanding borrowings of million under the notes  at a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  we had million outstanding borrowings under our abl facility 
as of september   we had million available for additional borrowings under our abl facility  subject to borrowing base limitations  as reduced by outstanding letters of credit 
the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 
these restrictions and limitations relate to disposal of assets making investments including joint ventures incurrence of additional indebtedness including guarantees of additional indebtedness mergers  consolidations or sales of subsidiaries assets stock repurchase  dividends and distributions transactions with affiliates certain debt prepayments and modifications ability of subsidiaries to pay dividends liens on assets in addition  the abl facility contains restrictions and limitations related to i changing our line of business  ii changing our fiscal year  and iii creating or incurring negative pledges 
the term loans and the abl facility are secured by substantially all of our assets  those of sally investment holdings llc  those of our domestic subsidiaries and  in the case of the abl facility  those of our canadian subsidiaries 
the term loans may be prepaid at our option at any time without premium or penalty and is subject to mandatory prepayment in an amount equal to of excess cash flow as defined in the agreement governing the term loans for any fiscal year commencing in fiscal year unless a specified leverage ratio is met and of the proceeds of specified asset sales that are not reinvested in the business or applied to repay borrowings under the abl facility 
the term loans contain a covenant requiring sally holdings and its subsidiaries to comply with maximum consolidated secured leverage ratio levels  which will decline over time 
the consolidated secured leverage ratio will be tested quarterly  with a maximum ratio of for the four quarter period ending september  the consolidated secured leverage ratio is a ratio of a net consolidated secured debt to b consolidated ebitda as defined in the agreement underlying the term loans 
the abl facility contains a covenant requiring sally holdings and its subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least to when availability under the abl facility falls below million 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of a ebitda as defined in the agreement underlying the abl facility  or credit agreement ebitda  less unfinanced capital expenditures to b fixed charges as included in the definition of the fixed charge coverage ratio in the agreement governing the abl facility 
the abl facility uses fixed amounts for credit agreement ebitda for periods preceding the separation transactions 
for purposes of calculating either the consolidated secured leverage ratio or the fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated ebitda and credit agreement ebitda are measured on a last four quarters basis 
accordingly  the calculation can be disproportionately affected by a particularly strong or weak quarter and may not be comparable to the measure for any previous or subsequent four quarter period 
failure to comply with the consolidated secured leverage ratio covenant under the term loans would result in a default under such facilities 
failure to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant if and when applicable under the abl facility would result in a default under such facility 
either such a default could also result in a default under the other facility or facilities  as the case may be  and the notes 
absent a waiver or an amendment from our lenders and note holders  such defaults could permit the acceleration of all indebtedness under the abl facility  the term loans and the notes  which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
consolidated ebitda and credit agreement ebitda are not recognized measurements under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for financial performance and liquidity measures determined in accordance with gaap  such as net earnings  operating income or operating cash flow 
in addition  because other companies may calculate ebitda differently  consolidated ebitda and credit agreement ebitda likely will not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe that we are currently in compliance with the agreements and instruments governing our debt  including our financial covenants 
our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance  which in turn will be subject to economic conditions and to financial  market and competitive factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to comply with these covenants in future periods will also depend substantially on the pricing of our products  our success at implementing cost reduction initiatives and our ability to successfully implement our overall business strategy 
see risk factors risks relating to our substantial indebtedness 
capital requirements for fiscal year  we anticipate total capital expenditures of approximately million 
capital expenditures will be primarily for the addition of new stores  our bsg distribution project  the remodel  expansion or relocation of existing facilities and various corporate projects 
contractual obligations the following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations and commitments outstanding by future payment dates at september  dollars in thousands payments due by period less than year years years more than years total long term debt  including interest obligations a  operating leases b     purchase obligations c     other long term obligations d     total      a long term debt includes capital leases and future interest payments on debt facilities  based upon outstanding principal amounts and interest rates as of september  b in accordance with gaap  these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the operating leases do not include executory costs 
c purchase obligations reflect legally binding agreements entered into by us to purchase goods that specify minimum quantities to be purchased with variable price provisions 
in accordance with gaap  these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
d other long term obligations principally represent commitments under various acquisition related agreements including non compete  consulting and severance agreements and deferred compensation arrangements 
these obligations are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the table above excludes amounts included in current liabilities  other than the current portion of long term debt  as these items will be paid within one year  and long term liabilities not requiring cash payments  such as deferred lease incentives 
our assumptions with respect to the interest rates applicable to the term loans and the abl facility are subject to changes that may be material 
in addition  other future events could cause actual payments to differ materially from these amounts 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report and item a quantitative qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk for a discussion of interest rate swap agreements 
the majority of our operating leases are for sally beauty supply and bsg stores  which typically are located in strip shopping centers 
the use of operating leases allows us to expand our business to new locations without making significant up front cash outlays for the purchase of land and buildings 
off balance sheet financing arrangements at september  and  we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements other than operating leases incurred in the ordinary course of business  as well as outstanding letters of credit related to inventory purchases and self insurance programs  which totaled million and million  respectively 
inflation we believe that inflation currently does not have a material effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable 
we consider accounting policies to be critical when they require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and when different estimates that our management reasonably could have used have a material effect on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
our critical accounting policies relate to the valuation of inventories  vendor allowances  retention of risk  income taxes and share based payments 
valuation of inventories when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of inventories to the lower of cost or market  including costs to sell or dispose  and for estimated inventory shrinkage 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market net realizable value 
estimates of the future demand for our products  age of the inventory and changes in stock keeping units are some of the key factors used by our management in assessing the net realizable value of inventories 
we estimate inventory shrinkage based on historical experience 
actual results differing from these estimates could significantly affect our inventories and cost of products sold and distribution expenses 
vendor allowances we account for cash consideration received from vendors under emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  or eitf eitf states that cash consideration received by a customer is presumed to be a reduction of the cost of sales unless it is for an asset or service or a reimbursement of a specific  incremental  identifiable cost incurred by the customer in selling the vendor s products 
the majority of cash consideration we receive is considered to be a reduction of the cost of sales and is allocated to cost of products sold and distribution expenses as the related inventory is sold 
we consider the facts and circumstances of the various contractual agreements with vendors in order to determine the appropriate classification of amounts received in the statements of earnings 
we record cash consideration expected to be received from vendors in other receivables 
these receivables are recorded at the amount we believe will be collected based on the provisions of the programs in place and are computed by estimating the point in time that we have completed our performance under the agreements and the amounts earned 
these receivables could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management s expectations 
retention of risk employee health insurance liability we maintain a largely self funded program for healthcare benefits for employees who work for us on a full time basis 
we cover the majority of expenses associated with these benefits  other than payroll deductions and out of pocket expenses paid by the employees 
payments for healthcare benefits below specified amounts currently  per individual per year and  per individual for a lifetime maximum are self insured by us 
we base our estimate of ultimate liability on trends in claim payment history  historical trends in claims incurred but not yet reported  and other components such as expected increases in medical costs  projected premium costs and the number of plan participants 
we review our liability on a regular basis and adjust our accruals accordingly 
as of september   we have accrued an estimated liability relating to employee health insurance of million 
prior to the separation transactions  our employees were covered by healthcare plans provided by alberto culver 
changes in facts and circumstances may lead to a change in the estimated liability due to revisions of the estimated ultimate costs of our employee healthcare benefits 
estimates of medical costs and trends in claims are some of the key factors used by our management in determining the liability 
this liability could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management s expectations 
workers compensation liability  general liability and automobile and property liability we maintain a large deductible insurance plan for workers compensation liability  general liability and automobile and property liability loss exposures 
we base our estimates of ultimate liability on an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party actuary 
we review our liability on a regular basis and adjust our accruals accordingly 
as of september   our balance sheet included an estimated liability related to the deductible and retention limits of approximately million 
prior to the separation transactions  we were covered by the workers compensation  general liability and automobile and property liability plans provided by alberto culver 
changes in facts and circumstances may lead to a change in the estimated liability due to revisions of the estimated ultimate costs that affect our workers compensation  general liability and automobile and property liability insurance coverage 
changes in estimates occur over time due to factors such as claims incidence and severity of injury or damages 
the liabilities could be significantly affected if actual results differ from management s expectations 
income taxes we record tax provisions in our consolidated financial statements based on an estimation of current income tax liabilities 
the development of these provisions requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing 
if we prevail in tax matters for which provisions have been established or are required to settle matters in excess of established provisions  our effective tax rate for a particular period could be significantly affected 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are estimated to be recovered or settled 
we believe that it is more likely than not that results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets  net of the valuation allowance currently recorded 
in the future  if we determine that certain deferred tax assets will not be realizable  the related adjustments could significantly affect our effective tax rate at that time 
share based payments effective october   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation expense is recognized for new stock option grants beginning in fiscal year and for the unvested portion of outstanding stock options that were granted prior to the adoption of sfas r 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period or to the date a participant becomes eligible for retirement  if earlier 
the amount of stock option expense is determined based on the fair value of each stock option grant  which is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions expected life  volatility  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the expected life of stock options represents the period of time that the stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
we estimate the expected life based on historical exercise trends 
we estimate expected volatility by using an industry group that we belong to since it is not practicable to estimate the expected volatility due to our lack of trading history 
the risk free interest rate is based on the zero coupon us treasury issue at the date of the grant for the expected life of the stock options 
the dividend yield represents our anticipated cash dividend over the expected life of the stock options 
the amount of stock option expense recorded is significantly affected by these estimates 
in addition  we record stock option expense based on an estimate of the total number of stock options expected to vest  which requires us to estimate future forfeitures 
we use historical forfeiture experience as a basis for this estimate 
actual forfeitures differing from these estimates could significantly affect the timing of the recognition of stock option expense 
we have based all these estimates on our assumptions as of september  our estimates for future periods may be based on different assumptions and accordingly may differ 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective in fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the effect of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective in fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the effect of this pronouncement on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying the misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
we implemented the provisions of sab during the first quarter of fiscal year and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  statements of earnings or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for the uncertainty in income taxes recognized by prescribing a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  interim period accounting and disclosure 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  statements of earnings or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a multinational corporation  we are subject to certain market risks including foreign currency fluctuations  interest rates and government actions 
we consider a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when deemed appropriate  the occasional use of derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
our primary exposures are to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the british pound sterling  canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso 
our various currency exposures at times offset each other providing a natural hedge against currency risk 
for fiscal year  approximately of our sales were made in currencies other than the us dollar
