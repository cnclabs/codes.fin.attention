item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition 
this section should be read in conjunction with item  selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k 
statements in our discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
we caution that a number of factors could cause future production  revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations 
see disclosures regarding forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report and risk factors in item a 
for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks 
overview of our business we are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  primarily in the southwestern  appalachian and gulf coast regions of the united states 
we operate in one segment 
we have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments 
we track only basic operational data by area 
we do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area 
we measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis 
our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions 
our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
industry environment we operate entirely within the united states  a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas 
as a mature region  while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the united states  the size and frequency of these discoveries is declining  while finding and development costs are increasing 
we believe that there remain areas of the united states  such as the appalachian basin and certain areas in our southwest and gulf coast divisions  which are underexplored or have not been fully explored and developed with the benefit of newly available exploration  production and reserve enhancement technology 
examples of such technology include advanced d seismic processing  hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation  advances in well logging and analysis  horizontal drilling and completion techniques  secondary and tertiary recovery practices  and automated remote well monitoring and control devices 
another characteristic of a mature region is the historical exit of larger independent producers and major oil companies from such regions 
these companies  searching for ever larger new discoveries  have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore  de emphasizing their onshore united states assets 
this movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets 
in other situations  to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending  larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures and farm in arrangements 
we believe the acquisition market for natural gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities 
acquisition values have reached historic highs and we expect these values to remain high in in addition  we expect drilling and service costs to remain at a high level in and for lease operating expenses to continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields 
natural gas is a commodity 
the price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand 
demand for natural gas in the united states has increased dramatically over the last ten years 
demand is impacted by general economic conditions  estimates of gas in storage  weather and other seasonal condition  including hurricanes and tropical storms 
market conditions involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility 
historically  commodity prices have been volatile and we expect the volatility to continue in the future 
a substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  cash flows  quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets 

table of contents source of our revenues we derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our properties 
revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale 
the price of oil and natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues 
to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations  we utilize derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas and oil production 
during  and the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods 
principal components of our cost structure direct operating expenses 
these are day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include workovers and repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance 
these costs are expected to remain high in as the demand for these services continues to increase 
direct operating expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of sars as part of employee compensation 
production and ad valorem taxes 
these costs are primarily paid based on a percentage of market prices and not on hedged prices of production or at fixed rates established by federal  state or local taxing authorities 
exploration expense 
geological and geophysical costs  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells or dry holes 
exploration expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of sars as part of employee compensation 
general and administrative expense 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our production and development operations  audit and other professional fees and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense non cash associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r  amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of sars as part of employee compensation 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with our longer term public traded debt securities 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
we expect our capital budget to be funded with internal cash flow and asset sales 
depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this also includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis 
currently  all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  at some point  we will utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income

table of contents overview of results during  we achieved the following results production growth and reserve growth  drilled over net wells  continued expansion of drilling inventory and emerging plays  record financial results and continued balance sheet improvement  and completed an acquisition of properties containing bcfe of proved reserves 
our performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of growth through drilling and complementary acquisitions 
the business of exploring for  developing  and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive 
as in any commodity business  the costs associated with finding  acquiring  extracting  and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders 
generating meaningful growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management 
during periods of historically high oil and gas prices  such as and  drilling service and operating cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services 
we faced other challenges in including attracting and retaining qualified personnel  consummating and integrating acquisitions  and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth and capital simplification process on sufficiently favorable terms 
we have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals 
our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to build  providing new growth opportunities  greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency 
total revenues increased in over the same period of this increase is due to higher production and realized oil and gas prices 
our production growth is due to acquisitions completed in and to the continued success of our drilling program 
realized prices were higher by in reflecting the expiration of lower priced oil and gas hedges 
as discussed in item a of this report  significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a significant impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations  particularly on the fair value of our derivatives

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  cash flows and liquidity during  our cash provided from continuing operations was million  and we spent million on capital expenditures including acquisitions 
during this period  financing activities provided net cash of million 
our financing activities included the sale of million of senior subordinated notes and additional borrowings under our bank credit agreement 
at december  we had million in cash  total assets of billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 
long term debt at december  totaled billion  including million of bank debt and million of senior subordinated notes 
available borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at december  was million 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves which is typical in the oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves 
we believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs 
however  long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and remain profitable 
we operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
our ability to expand our reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves 
bank debt we maintain an million revolving credit facility  which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility 
the bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on october  availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the banks semi annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances 
the borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at february   the bank credit facility had a billion borrowing base and an million facility amount 
credit availability is equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base resulting in credit availability of million on february  the facility amount can be increased to the borrowing base with twenty days notice 
limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under our bank debt and our subordinated notes 
under the bank credit facility  common and preferred dividends are permitted 
the terms of each of our subordinated notes limit restricted payments including dividends to the greater of million or a formula based on earnings and equity issuances since the original issuances of the notes 
at december   approximately million was available under the restricted payment baskets for each of our subordinated notes 
the bank credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of million plus of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and of net income 
approximately million was available under the bank credit facility restricted payment basket as of december  the debt agreements contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence  working capital  dividends and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants at december  cash flow our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow  bank borrowings and at times  issuance of debt and equity securities 
our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
as of december   we had entered into hedging agreements covering bcfe and bcfe for and the million of cash capital expenditures for  excluding acquisitions  was funded with internal cash flow and borrowing under the bank credit facility 
the million capital budget for  which excludes acquisitions  is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base 
based on current projections  oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position  the capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow and asset sales 
net cash provided from continuing operations in was million  compared with million in and million in in  cash flow from continuing operations increased due to higher production

the period included million in additions to oil and gas properties and million of acquisitions 
net cash provided from financing activities in was million compared with million in and million in historically  sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  we received proceeds of million from the issuance of our notes 
during  we received proceeds of million and million from the issuance of our notes and a common stock offering 
during  the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility declined million primarily due to the proceeds received from the notes being applied to our bank debt 
during  we received proceeds of million and million from the issuance of additional notes and two common stock offerings  respectively 
during  the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility increased million with million related to the great lakes acquisition and the remaining increase the result of funding other acquisitions 
also in  we redeemed the remaining outstanding debentures for million 
capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends 
during  million of capital was expended on drilling projects 
also in  million was expended on acquisitions primarily to purchase producing properties 
the capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded by net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and our acquisitions were funded primarily with proceeds received from the issuance of our notes and borrowings under our credit facility 
the capital budget of million  excluding acquisitions  is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and asset sales 
in february  we sold the austin chalk properties for proceeds of million 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow and asset sales 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
the stroud acquisition included the issuance of million shares and the assumption of million of debt 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  extend maturities or to repay debt 
cash dividend payments the amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and depends on earnings  capital expenditures and various other factors  such as restrictions under our bank debt and our subordinated notes

future commitments in addition to our capital expenditure program  we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts note agreements and operating leases 
as of december   we do not have any capital leases nor have we entered into any material long term contracts for equipment 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party

b derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of december  c this table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets 
hedging oil and gas prices we enter into derivative agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on our operations 
at december   swaps were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of to and million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of to 
the derivative fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination  based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  approximated a pretax gain of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenue in the period the hedged production is sold 
realized hedging losses of million were recognized in compared to losses of million in and losses of million in changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other revenue 
unrealized effective gains and losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  on our consolidated balance sheet as other comprehensive income oci a component of stockholders equity 
as of the fourth quarter of  certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of volatility of gas prices in the fourth quarter of and on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices

off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance liquidity and capital resource position  or for any other purpose 
inflation and changes in prices our revenues  the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business 
in a trend that began in and accelerated during and  commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly 
the higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry and  consequently  rising costs 
these costs trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on our capital costs 
we expect further increases in these costs for

table of contents management s discussion of critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable  however  actual results may differ 
certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes  and b the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
oil and gas properties proved reserves are defined by the sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price and cost changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by us 
we cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our vice president of reservoir engineering who reports directly to our chief operating officer 
to further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates  we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves 
historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 
the following table sets forth a summary of the percent of reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended  and audited a a audited reserves are those reserves estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant 
we utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers 
costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if a the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and b we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project 
otherwise  well costs are expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following completion of drilling and these criteria are not met 
proven property leasehold costs are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves 
unproved properties are assessed periodically at least annually and impairments to value are charged to expense 
the successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves  which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes 
we adhere to the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies  for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties 
the greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs 
the costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated at least annually as to recoverability  based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in 
table of contents business strategy employed by management 
we consider a combination of time  geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs 
unproved properties had a net book value of million in compared to million in and million in depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in note  supplemental information on natural gas and oil exploration  development and production activities to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
we monitor our long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
we must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  future abandonment costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustment to reserves  physical damage to production equipment and facilities  a change in costs  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
we cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 
we are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions 
derivatives we use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
we account for our commodity derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
for derivative contracts designated as hedges  earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price 
ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract 
this may result in significant volatility to current period income 
for derivatives qualifying as hedges  the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income oci  and then reclassified to earnings  in oil and gas revenue  when the hedged transaction is consummated 
this may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity 
the fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination 
as of the fourth quarter of  certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility of gas prices and their effect on our basis differentials and are marked to market 
the commodity derivatives we use include commodity collars and swaps 
while there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising prices may not be captured  we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important 
among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions  the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital  smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs  more consistent returns on invested capital  and better access to bank and other credit markets 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations 
removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 

table of contents inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs  inflation factors  credit adjusted discount rates  timing of retirement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
to the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation  aro  a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance 
in addition  increases in the discounted aro liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense  a component of depletion  depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations 
deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require oci to be considered  even though such income or loss has not yet been earned 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in oci 
at year end  deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by million  with million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized hedging gains included in oci 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely  particularly our outstanding litigation  we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities

table of contents item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
all accounts are us dollar denominated 
market risk our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
commodity price risk we periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production 
these arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty 
our derivatives program also includes collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price 
the majority of our derivatives qualify as accounting hedges 
in times of increasing price volatility  we may experience losses from our hedging arrangements and increased basis differentials at the delivery points where we market our production 
widening basis differentials occur when the physical delivery market prices do not increase proportionately to the increased prices in the financial trading markets 
realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income 
generally  derivative losses occur when market prices increase  which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction 
conversely  derivative gains occur when market prices decrease  which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction 
ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes 
though not all of our derivatives qualify as accounting hedges  the purpose of entering into the contracts is to economically hedge oil and gas prices 
those that do not qualify as accounting hedges are marked to market through earnings 
as of december   we had oil and gas swaps in place covering bcf of gas 
we also had collars covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
these contracts expire monthly through december the fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of december   approximated a net pre tax gain of million 
gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by us for the sale of our hedged production and the hedge price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
these gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
in  pre tax losses were realized in the amount of million compared to losses of million in and losses of million in gains and losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
the ineffective portion of hedges that qualified for hedge accounting was a gain of million in compared to a loss of million in and a gain of  in other commodity risk we are impacted by basis risk  caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity 
natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets 
if commodity prices changes in one region are not reflected in other regions  derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge  resulting in increased basis risk 
as of the fourth quarter of  certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility in gas prices and its effect on our basis differentials and are marked to market 
this resulted in a gain of million in the fourth quarter of compared to a gain of million in the year ended december  in the income statement category called mark to market on oil and gas derivatives 

table of contents at december   the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding period contract type volume hedged average hedge price natural gas swaps  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day swaps  mmbtu day collars  mmbtu day crude oil collars  bbl day collars  bbl day in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenue by million 
if oil and gas futures prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging gain at that date would have increased million 
interest rate risk at december   we had billion of debt outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 
bank debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged on that date 
on december   the day libor rate was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost us approximately million in additional annual interest rates
