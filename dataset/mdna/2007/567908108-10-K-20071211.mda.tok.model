item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with part i  including the matters set forth in the risk factors section of this form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are the largest recreational boat retailer in the united states with fiscal revenue in excess of billion 
through our current retail locations in states  we sell new and used recreational boats and related marine products  including engines  trailers  parts  and accessories 
we also arrange related boat financing  insurance  and extended warranty contracts  provide boat repair and maintenance services  and offer yacht and boat brokerage services  and where available  offer slip and storage accommodations 
marinemax was incorporated in january we commenced operations with the acquisition of five independent recreational boat dealers on march  since the initial acquisitions in march  we have significantly expanded our operations through the acquisition of recreational boat dealers  two boat brokerage operations  and two full service yacht repair facilities 
as a part of our acquisition strategy  we frequently engage in discussions with various recreational boat dealers regarding their potential acquisition by us 
potential acquisition discussions frequently take place over a long period of time and involve difficult business integration and other issues  including in some cases  management succession and related matters 
as a result of these and other factors  a number of potential acquisitions that from time to time appear likely to occur do not result in binding legal agreements and are not consummated 
no significant acquisitions were completed during the fiscal years ended september  and the following are the acquisitions we completed during the fiscal year ended september  during march  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of surfside marina  inc surfside  a privately held boat dealership with eight locations in new york and connecticut  for approximately million in cash and  shares of common stock  plus million in working capital adjustments including acquisition costs 
the shares were valued at per share  which was the average closing market price of our common stock for the five day period beginning two days prior to and ending two days subsequent to the acquisition date 
the acquisition expands our ability to serve consumers in the northeast boating community and allows us to capitalize on surfside s market position and leverage our inventory management and inventory financing resources over the acquired locations 
based on a third party valuation  the purchase price  including acquisition costs  resulted in the recognition of approximately million of tax deductible goodwill and approximately million of tax deductible indefinite lived intangible assets dealer agreements 
surfside has been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
during january  we acquired substantially all of the assets  including certain real estate  and assumed certain liabilities of the port arrowhead group port arrowhead  a privately held boat dealership with locations in missouri and oklahoma  for approximately million in cash  plus million in working capital adjustments including acquisition costs 
port arrowhead operates six retail locations  including a large marina with more than slips 
the acquisition expands our ability to serve consumers in the midwest boating community  including neighboring boating destinations in illinois  kansas  and arkansas 
the acquisition also allows us to capitalize on port arrowhead s market position and leverage our inventory management and inventory financing resources over the acquired locations 
based on a third party valuation  the purchase price  including acquisition costs  resulted in the recognition of approximately million of tax deductible goodwill and approximately million of tax deductible indefinite lived intangible assets dealer agreements 
port arrowhead has been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 

table of contents in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from boat  motor  and trailer sales  and parts and service operations at the time the boat  motor  trailer  or part is delivered to or accepted by the customer or service is completed 
we recognize commissions earned from a brokerage sale at the time the related brokerage transaction closes 
we recognize revenue from slip and storage services on a straight line basis over the term of the slip or storage agreement 
we recognize commissions earned by us for placing notes with financial institutions in connection with customer boat financing when we recognize the related boat sales 
we also recognize marketing fees earned on credit life  accident and disability  and hull insurance products sold by third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the insurance product as evidenced by contract execution  or when the related boat sale is recognized 
we also recognize commissions earned on extended warranty service contracts sold on behalf of third party insurance companies at the later of customer acceptance of the service contract terms as evidenced by contract execution  or recognition of the related boat sale 
certain finance and extended warranty commissions and marketing fees on insurance products may be charged back if a customer terminates or defaults on the underlying contract within a specified period of time 
based upon our experience of repayments and defaults  we maintain a chargeback allowance that was not material to our financial statements taken as a whole as of september  or should results differ materially from our historical experiences  we would need to modify our estimate of future chargebacks  which could have a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
vendor consideration received we account for consideration received from our vendors in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf most significantly requires us to classify interest assistance received from manufacturers as a reduction of inventory cost and related cost of sales as opposed to netting the assistance against our interest expense incurred with our lenders 
pursuant to eitf  amounts received by us under our co op assistance programs from our manufacturers  are netted against related advertising expenses 
inventories inventory costs consist of the amount paid to acquire the inventory  net of vendor consideration and purchase discounts  the cost of equipment added  reconditioning costs  and transportation costs relating to acquiring inventory for sale 
we state new and used boat  motor  and trailer inventories at the lower of cost  determined on a specific identification basis  or market 
we state parts and accessories at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out basis  or market 
if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its fair value  we reduce the carrying amount to reflect fair value 
we utilize our historical experience and current sales trends as the basis for our lower of cost or market analysis 
if events occur and market conditions change  causing the fair value to fall below carrying value  further reductions may be required 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that all business combinations initiated after june  be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized as assets and reported separately from goodwill 
we have determined that our most significant acquired identifiable intangible assets are dealer agreements  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of goodwill or an identifiable intangible asset exceeds its fair value  we would recognize an impairment loss 
we measure any potential impairment based on various business valuation methodologies  including a projected discounted cash flow method 
we completed our last annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal  based on financial information as of the third quarter of fiscal  which resulted in no impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets in the application of sfas we will continue to test goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
prior to the adoption of sfas  all purchase price in excess of the net tangible assets was recorded as goodwill and no identifiable intangible assets were recognized 
net goodwill and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million and million  respectively  at september  the most significant estimates used in our goodwill valuation model include estimates of the future growth in our cash flows and future working capital needs to support our projected growth 
should circumstances change causing these assumptions to differ materially than expected  our goodwill may become impaired  resulting in a material adverse effect on our operating margins 
impairment of long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to undiscounted future net cash flows the asset is expected to generate 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent management s best estimate based on currently available information and reasonable and supportable assumptions 
any impairment recognized in accordance with sfas is permanent and may not be restored 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of long lived assets in connection with sfas stock based compensation prior to october   we accounted for our share based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
under apb  because the grant price was equal to or greater than fair value no compensation expense was recorded in earnings for our stock options and awards granted under our employee stock purchase plan espp 
the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share for stock options and espp awards were disclosed in a footnote to the financial statements 
compensation expense was recorded in earnings for non vested common stock awards restricted stock awards and restricted stock units and board of director fees 

table of contents effective october   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r for our share based compensation plans 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal and includes a the compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and b the compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to september   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of our adoption of sfas r  we recorded compensation expense for stock options of approximately million and million before tax  or and per diluted share after tax for the fiscal years ended september  and income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under sfas  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we operate in multiple states with varying tax laws and are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
we make estimates to determine that our tax reserves are adequate to cover audit adjustments  if any 
actual audit results could vary from the estimates recorded by us 
as the number of years that are open for tax audits vary depending on tax jurisdiction  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of a particular tax matter  we believe that our consolidated financial statements reflect the appropriate outcome of known tax contingencies 
for a more comprehensive list of our accounting policies  including those which involve varying degrees of judgment  see note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated fiscal year ended september  amounts in thousands revenue cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net income before income tax provision income tax provision net income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to billion for the fiscal year ended september  from billion for the fiscal year ended september  of this increase  million was attributable to stores opened  closed  or acquired that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base  
table of contents partially offset by a decline of million attributable to a less than decline in comparable store sales in fiscal the decline in same store sales was net of an increase in revenue from our parts  service  finance  and insurance products of approximately million 
the decline in our same store sales was due to softer economic conditions which have adversely impacted our retail sales 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a margin reduction on boat sales as we became more aggressive in the softer market place in order to achieve our sales volume 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased approximately basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  for fiscal  we recorded million of business interruption insurance proceeds that was received for claims associated with hurricane wilma in  we recorded a million gain from the sale of our jet  and we recorded a  gain related to insurance proceeds we received associated with the snow and ice storm damage at certain missouri locations 
we recorded these items as a reduction to selling  general  and administrative expenses 
excluding these items  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue was for the year ended september  this approximate basis point increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to the reported same store sales decline and increased personnel and marketing related costs incurred to drive retail sales in a softer retail environment 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings associated with our revolving credit facility and mortgages  which accounted for an increase in interest expense of approximately million and a less favorable interest rate environment  which accounted for an increase of approximately million in interest expense 
income tax provision 
income taxes decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september   primarily as a result of our decreased earnings 
our effective tax rate decreased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september   primarily as a result of the settlement of certain tax positions under an initiative offered by one of the states in which we conduct operations 
as a result of this settlement  we reduced the reserve for contingent income taxes by approximately million and reduced income tax expense by approximately million for the fiscal year ended september  without this reduction  the effective tax rate would have been approximately for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to billion for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  of this increase  million was attributable to stores opened or acquired that were not eligible for inclusion in the comparable store base and million was attributable to a growth in comparable store sales for fiscal the increase in comparable store sales for fiscal resulted primarily from an increase of approximately million in boat and yacht sales 
this increase in boat and yacht sales on a comparable store basis helped generate an increase in revenue from our parts  service  finance  and insurance products of approximately million 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in service  finance  insurance  parts  and brokerage revenue  which generally yield higher gross margins than boat sales  and an increase in manufacturer programs in place for the year ended september  the 
table of contents increase in gross profit was partially offset by a decrease in gross margins on boat sales  coupled with an increase in yacht sales  which generally yield lower gross margins than boat sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased approximately basis points to for the year ended september  from for the year ended september  for fiscal  the increase as a percentage of revenue was attributable to approximately million of stock option compensation expense  resulting from the adoption of sfas r and approximately million of hurricane related expenses to move and repair inventory net of related insurance reimbursements and uninsured losses to our locations 
additionally  our selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased as a result of increased marketing and commission expenses associated with achieving our level of comparable store sales growth  increased facilities  and other costs associated with new and acquired stores 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  interest expense as a percentage of revenue increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was primarily a result of increased borrowings associated with our revolving credit facility and mortgages  which accounted for an increase in interest expense of approximately million and a less favorable interest rate environment  which accounted for an increase of approximately million in interest expense 
income tax provision 
income taxes increased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended september  from million for the fiscal year ended september  as a result of increased earnings 
our effective tax rate increased to for the fiscal year ended september  from for the fiscal year ended september  as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
quarterly data and seasonality our business  as well as the entire recreational boating industry  is highly seasonal  with seasonality varying in different geographic markets 
with the exception of florida  we generally realize significantly lower sales and higher levels of inventories  and related short term borrowings  in the quarterly periods ending december and march the onset of the public boat and recreation shows in january stimulates boat sales and allows us to reduce our inventory levels and related short term borrowings throughout the remainder of the fiscal year 
our business could become substantially more seasonal as we acquire dealers that operate in colder regions of the united states 
our business is also subject to weather patterns  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels or excessive rain may close area boating locations or render boating dangerous or inconvenient  thereby curtailing customer demand for our products 
in addition  unseasonably cool weather and prolonged winter conditions may lead to a shorter selling season in certain locations 
hurricanes and other storms could result in disruptions of our operations or damage to our boat inventories and facilities  as was the case during fiscal and when florida and other markets were affected by numerous hurricanes 
although our geographic diversity is likely to reduce the overall impact to us of adverse weather conditions in any one market area  these conditions will continue to represent potential  material adverse risks to us and our future financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations  including new and used boat and related parts inventories  off season liquidity  and growth through acquisitions and new store openings 
we regularly monitor the aging of our inventories and current market trends to evaluate our current and future inventory needs 
we also use this evaluation in conjunction with our review of our current and expected operating performance and expected growth to determine the adequacy of our financing needs 
these cash needs have historically been financed with cash generated from operations and borrowings under our line of credit facility 
we currently depend upon dividends and other payments from our consolidated operating subsidiaries and our line of 
table of contents credit facility to fund our current operations and meet our cash needs 
currently  no agreements exist that restrict this flow of funds from our operating subsidiaries 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash provided by operating activities approximated million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable due to the timing of certain payments to our manufacturers and an increase in inventories due to the continued expansion of existing product lines and to ensure appropriate inventory levels  partially offset by net income and an increase in customer deposits 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to net income  adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation charges  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to increased revenues  an increase in inventories to ensure appropriate inventory levels  and a decrease in customer deposits 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by operating activities was due primarily to net income  adjusted for non cash depreciation  amortization  and stock based compensation charges  and increases in customer deposits and accrued expenses  partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable  and an increase in inventories to ensure appropriate inventory levels 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used in business acquisitions and to purchase property and equipment associated with opening new retail facilities or improving and relocating existing retail facilities 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase property and equipment associated with opening new retail facilities or improving and relocating existing retail facilities 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was primarily used to purchase property and equipment associated with opening new retail facilities or improving and relocating existing retail facilities and in the finalization of certain business acquisitions  partially offset by proceeds received from the sale and involuntary conversion of property and equipment 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in financing activities was approximately million 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from common shares issued through the february public offering  upon the exercise of stock options  and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by net repayments on short term borrowings as a result of using the proceeds from the issuance of common shares through the february public offering and repayments of long term debt 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to proceeds from net borrowings on short term borrowings as a result of increased inventory levels and borrowings on long term debt on equipment and real estate acquired  and proceeds from common shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and under the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by purchases of treasury stock and repayments of long term debt 
for the fiscal year ended september   cash used in financing activities was primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock and repayments of long term debt  partially offset by proceeds from net borrowings on short term borrowings as a result of increased inventory levels  and proceeds from common shares issued upon the exercise of stock options and under the employee stock purchase plan 
as of september   our indebtedness totaled approximately million  of which approximately million was associated with our real estate holdings and million was associated with financing our inventory and working capital needs 
during june  we entered into an amendment of our existing credit facility  which modified the definition of fixed charges coverage ratio and extended the term of our second amended and restated credit and security agreement entered into in june with the same lenders 
the amended credit facility matures in may  with two one year renewal options 
at september   we were in compliance with all of the credit facility covenants 

table of contents prior to june  we entered into a second amended and restated credit and security agreement with eight financial institutions during june the credit facility provides us a line of credit with asset based borrowing availability of up to million for working capital and inventory financing  with the amount of permissible borrowings determined pursuant to a borrowing base formula 
the credit facility also permits approved vendor floorplan borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility accrues interest at libor plus to basis points  with the interest rate based upon the ratio of our net outstanding borrowings to our tangible net worth 
the credit facility is secured by our inventory  accounts receivable  equipment  furniture  and fixtures 
the credit facility requires us to satisfy certain covenants  including maintaining a leverage ratio tied to our tangible net worth 
the other terms and conditions of the new credit facility are generally similar to the previous credit facility 
the credit facility extended the maturity of the credit facility to may  with two one year renewal options 
for the periods ending september  and the credit facility provided us with asset based borrowing availability up to million and million  and accrued interest at a rate of libor plus to basis points 
during the fiscal years ended september    and  we completed the acquisition of two marine retail operations 
we acquired the net assets  related property  and buildings and assumed or retired certain liabilities  including the outstanding floorplan obligations related to new boat inventories  for approximately million in cash  plus million in working capital adjustments  including acquisition costs  and  shares of common stock valued at per share 
except as specified in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition  and results of operations and in our consolidated financial statements  we have no material commitments for capital for the next months 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months  except for possible significant acquisitions 
contractual commitments and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  line of long term operating year ending september  credit debt leases total amounts in thousands thereafter total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at september   approximately of our short and long term debt bore interest at variable rates  generally tied to a reference rate such as the libor rate or the prime rate of interest of certain banks 
changes in interest rates on loans from these financial institutions could affect our earnings as a result of interest rates charged on certain underlying obligations that are variable 
at september   a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate obligations would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in annual pre tax interest expense 
this estimated increase is based upon the outstanding balances of all of our variable rate obligations and assumes no mitigating changes by us to reduce the outstanding balances or additional interest assistance that would be received from vendors due to the hypothetical interest rate increase 
products purchased from the italy based ferretti group are subject to fluctuations in the euro to us dollar exchange rate  which ultimately may impact the retail price at which we can sell such products 
accordingly  fluctuations in the value of the euro as compared with the us dollar may impact the price points at which we can sell profitably ferretti group products  and such price points may not be competitive with other product lines in the 
table of contents united states 
accordingly  such fluctuations in exchange rates ultimately may impact the amount of revenue  cost of goods sold  cash flows  and earnings we recognize for the ferretti group product line 
we cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on our operating results 
in certain cases  we may enter into foreign currency cash flow hedges to reduce the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted purchases of boats and yachts from ferretti group 
we are not currently engaged in material foreign currency exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
if and when we do engage in material foreign currency exchange hedging transactions  we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations
