item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview and outlook we had a strong year in with many notable accomplishments across the enterprise 
from a financial perspective  revenues  earnings and operating cash flows from continuing operations were all up significantly  despite the challenges at bell with the h upgrade and armed reconnaissance helicopter arh programs 
from a portfolio perspective  we completed several strategic actions to strengthen our product mix 
our continued focus on the generation and support of organic growth through strong investments in engineering  research and development and capacity expansion were evident across the enterprise 
for example  at bell helicopter  our reinvigorated commercial line contributed to a increase in commercial deliveries in and we are optimistic about continued helicopter growth  in large part  due to the market s enthusiasm for our recently introduced model 
new products at cessna also are generating extraordinary customer interest and expanding the scope of our market 
this year we introduced two additions to our line of citation jets  the xls and the cj we also were the first to certify and deliver a jet  the mustang  in the new entry level jet category 
for the year  we booked new jet orders  which demonstrates the strength of our product line and the market in general 
some of the more notable financial highlights for include revenues increased to billon in  primarily driven by growth in our aerospace  defense and finance businesses 
our organic growth rate  which excludes the effects of acquisitions and dispositions  was 
earnings per share from continuing operations increased to 
the combination of higher revenues and our ongoing cost containment and operational efficiency initiatives  along with a decrease in the average of diluted common shares outstanding  translated into a growth rate more than triple our revenue growth rate 
operating cash flows from our manufacturing businesses increased by to billion 
with our strong operating cash flows and solid balance sheet  we were able to make strategic business acquisitions and return value to our shareholders as follows we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million 
we increased our dividend by per share to per share  resulting in total dividend payments of million 
we added two companies  innovative survivability technologies and overwatch systems  to our defense business for million 
we acquired a distribution finance business from electrolux in our finance segment for million 
commercial backlog increased to billion  primarily related to cessna 
in addition  our us government backlog increased to billion  primarily in the bell segment 
we received million in proceeds related to the disposition of non core manufacturing businesses 
these dispositions include the sale of our fastening systems business and jacobsen s commercial grounds care business

diluted earnings per share and manufacturing cash provided by operating activities are for continuing operations only 
outlook looking ahead  we expect revenues in excess of billion  with growth led by our aerospace and defense businesses 
we expect strong growth in business jet deliveries as we deliver against our record backlog and respond to increasing global demand 
we also are preparing to deliver more commercial helicopters in as we execute against backlog in this market 
our defense businesses are expected to remain strong as we continue to support the us government s efforts in iraq and elsewhere 
we expect segment profit to increase reflecting improvements in each of the manufacturing segments 
consolidated results of operations revenues in  our revenues increased billion primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of billion  higher pricing of million and higher revenues in the finance segment of million 
in  revenues increased billion primarily due to higher manufacturing sales volume of billion  higher pricing of million  additional revenues of million from acquisitions and higher revenues in the finance segment of million 
segment profit in  our segment profit increased million primarily due to higher pricing of million  higher sales volume of million  improved cost performance of million in the industrial segment  favorable warranty performance at cessna of million and higher profit in the finance segment of million 
these increases were partially offset by inflation of million  higher spending for engineering and new product development of million  higher overhead of million in bell s commercial business and increased charges related to the h low rate initial production lrip contracts of million 
in  segment profit increased million primarily due to higher sales volume of million  higher pricing of million and higher profit in the finance segment of million 
these increases were partially offset by inflation of million 
special charges special charges totaled million for and included million in charges related to the disposition of the automotive trim business trim and million in restructuring expense in the industrial segment 
in  special charges totaled million and included million in restructuring expense principally in the industrial segment  partially offset by a million gain on the sale of common stock acquired in connection with the trim disposition 
in connection with the disposition of trim to subsidiaries of collins aikman corporation c a  we acquired preferred stock in c a products co 
c a products and c a common stock 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge to write down the preferred stock based on an agreement to sell the stock to a third party 
in the second quarter of  based on c a products filing for chapter bankruptcy protection and relevant market considerations  we wrote off the remaining book value of the preferred stock of million 
in connection with the trim disposition  our finance group has recourse to our manufacturing group for equipment leases with the subsidiaries of c a 
the outstanding balance on these leases totaled approximately million at december  based on uncertainties related to these leases  our manufacturing group recorded a million reserve to special charges in the fourth quarter of certain other operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of c a upon the sale of trim 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we guaranteed c a s payments under these operating leases and for an environmental matter 
in the fourth quarter of  based on c a s failure to pay certain leases  as well as the negotiations entered into at the time for the sale of c a s european operations  we recorded an million charge to special charges to cover our exposure under these leases  along with certain environmental and workers compensation matters 
we substantially completed our company wide restructuring program at the end of see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information about this program 
in  we recorded million in restructuring expense under the program for severance and other associated costs 
in  we recorded million in restructuring expense under the program with million in contract termination costs  million in severance costs and million in other associated costs 
we have approximately million in restructuring reserves remaining at the end of primarily related to contract termination costs for one lease in the industrial segment which will be paid out over the next years 
corporate expenses and other  net corporate expenses and other  net increased million in principally due to million of higher share based compensation expense and million of higher incentive compensation  partially offset by million of lower expenses related to corporate initiatives 
corporate expenses and other  net increased million in  principally due to million for higher compensation and pension costs  million for corporate initiatives and million for the corporate portion of share based compensation expense recorded upon the adoption of a new accounting standard

operating results of these discontinued businesses  primarily related to fastening systems  are as follows in millions revenue loss income from discontinued operations before special charges special charges loss from discontinued operations income tax expense benefit operating loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain on disposal  net of income taxes loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes in  the loss from discontinued operations includes a million goodwill impairment charge related to our fastening systems business 
in addition  we recorded an after tax charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  which included million related to previously deferred foreign currency translation losses and million in curtailment losses for employee retirement plans 
after these charges  we assessed the estimated fair value of the business and determined that no further adjustment to the carrying value was required at that time 
in the second quarter of  we recorded an additional million after tax impairment charge to record the business at the estimated fair value less cost to sell at the time based on offers received from potential purchasers 
in  we recorded a net million gain on disposal  primarily related to a tax benefit recorded upon the sale of intesys 
segment analysis our four reportable segments are bell  cessna  industrial and finance 
these segments reflect the manner in which we manage our operations 
segment profit is an important measure used to evaluate performance and for decision making purposes 
segment profit for the manufacturing segments excludes interest expense  certain corporate expenses and special charges 
the measurement for the finance segment includes interest income and expense and excludes special charges

bell dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog at bell helicopter bell helicopter currently is in the early stages of development or production for a number of government and commercial programs that are anticipated to significantly drive revenue and profit growth in future years 
government programs generally follow a three phase cycle consisting of development  transition to production  and full rate production ramp up 
each phase has specific risks and operational challenges 
over the next few years  bell helicopter s major government programs will be transitioning through various phases of this cycle 
bell helicopter programs with the us government include the v military tiltrotor aircraft  the h upgrade program and the arh program 
the v program is in full rate production and delivered aircraft in the h upgrade program is in the transition to production phase  and the arh program is in the system development and demonstration sdd phase 
in  we made significant investments to conduct research and development  transition development contracts to production  increase our production capacity and implement improved operational systems to manage anticipated growth in bell helicopter s programs 
these investments have negatively impacted our financial results  and include significant ongoing production ramp up primarily for the v program  ongoing development efforts related primarily to the model and the arh program  and the h s transition to production 
the costs of investing in improved operational systems resulted in higher overhead expenses during while these higher overhead costs have been reflected in lower earnings in the commercial business  a portion of these costs have been absorbed into overhead in the government business due to the relatively long production cycle  particularly into v production inventory 
the overhead costs are anticipated to moderate in however  as v aircraft currently in production are delivered in future periods  the overhead expenses reflected in inventory will result in lower margins on these shipments 
textron systems has continued to experience strong growth in its us government business  delivering armored security vehicles asv in to support our troops in iraq and elsewhere 
during  textron systems added to its offerings to the defense industry by acquiring two businesses  innovative survivability technologies and overwatch systems 
bell revenues us government business in  revenues increased million  compared with primarily due to higher net volume and mix of million and the benefit from acquisitions of million 
the volume increase is primarily due to higher asv deliveries of million  higher arh sdd development revenue of million  increased spares and service sales of million  and additional intelligent battlefield systems volume of million  partially offset by lower v volume of million and lower h revenue of million 
in  revenues increased million  compared with primarily due to higher revenue of million from the v program  higher asv volume of million  the benefit of million from the us helicopter acquisition  higher military spares volume of million and increased sales of million for air launched weapons 
additionally  bell recognized million on the arh sdd contract 
commercial business in  commercial revenues increased million  compared with due to higher volume of million and pricing of million 
the volume increase is primarily due to higher civil aircraft deliveries of million  higher spares and service sales of million and additional deliveries of huey ii kits of million  partially offset by lower international military deliveries of million 
in  commercial revenues increased million  compared with primarily due to higher aircraft sales of million  higher spares volume of million and higher international military sales of million 
international military sales increased primarily due to higher asv deliveries to foreign customers of million  partially offset by lower helicopter volume of million 
bell segment profit us government business in  profit in our us government business decreased million  compared with the decrease was primarily due to inflation of million and unfavorable cost performance of million  partially offset by the impact of higher net volume and mix of million 
the unfavorable performance reflected higher anticipated costs for the h lrip contracts of million and charges of million related to the arh sdd contract  partially offset by favorable program performance at textron systems of million  primarily related to hurricane katrina 
in  profit in our us government business increased million  compared with the increase was principally due to higher v volume of million  reflecting the delivery of aircraft from lots and  higher volume and improved performance of air launched weapons totaling million  and increased asv deliveries and improved performance of million 
these increases were partially offset by million of costs associated with hurricane katrina 
h program the h program continues in development and currently is undergoing its operational evaluation 
we also entered into three firm fixed price lrip contracts with the us government under this program that represent the first h program production aircraft 
in addition  a firm fixed price option exists for a fourth production lot 
during the transition to production phase  we anticipate incurring costs in excess of contractual reimbursement on the first two h lrip contracts 
we anticipate that once the initial h lrip aircraft are delivered and the production operations are validated  costs will moderate as the production configuration is stabilized  production inefficiencies are resolved and learning curve improvements are realized 
during  we estimated that the costs to complete h lrip lot would exceed contractual reimbursement 
through the third quarter of  we recorded million in charges related to the h lrip lot contract 
these charges primarily reflected the impact of higher estimated incremental costs for resources added to meet the contractual schedule requirements and higher anticipated efforts in final assembly 
at the end of the third quarter  we had anticipated that acceptance of the initial h lrip lot aircraft by the us government would occur in the fourth quarter of however  acceptance was delayed and no aircraft were delivered 
this delay was due to changes in the development and engineering requirements that were identified in the final stages of assembly and acceptance testing 
due to this delay and the costs associated with the additional development efforts  rework of in process units and resulting inefficiencies  we increased our estimate of the completion costs in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  we recorded an additional million charge related to the h lrip lot contract in the fourth quarter of in january  the us government accepted two aircraft and we expect the remaining seven h lrip lot units to be accepted later in the h lrip lot contract is in the early stages of production  with first aircraft delivery anticipated in the second half of we now anticipate that the disruption and delays experienced with the h lrip lot contract in the fourth quarter will result in increased costs for the h lrip lot contract due to delays in its completion  as well as a reduction in previously anticipated learning curve improvements 
due to these higher cost estimates  the h lrip lot contract now is in a loss position resulting in a fourth quarter charge of million 
the net h program charge  including favorable performance on the engineering and manufacturing development contract of million  was million in the fourth quarter of arh program the arh sdd contract is a cost plus incentive fee contract under which our eligibility for fees is reduced as total contract costs increase 
during  we continued our development activities for this program and expensed million in unreimbursed costs related to this effort 
we continue to work with the us government on development issues  configuration changes and schedule requirements 
we no longer are eligible to earn fees under this contract  however  we anticipate that any subsequent cost increases are reimbursable by the us government 
the us government had two firm fixed price options under this program  representing the first two lrip lots for the delivery of to aircraft 
certain development requirements under the arh sdd contract must be met before the us government can exercise the options 
we presently anticipate that the development requirements will be met in mid the option for the first lrip lot for aircraft has expired  while the option for the second lot for aircraft expires in december in the fourth quarter of  we completed certain phases of the critical design review under the arh sdd contract and determined the initial production configuration of the aircraft  which includes aircraft configuration changes required by the us government 
our cost estimates based on this configuration  which include anticipated transition to production costs  exceed the fixed pricing contained in the options 
we currently are in discussions with the us government related to the possible reinstatement of the arh lot option  extension of the options  delivery schedule  number of units to be exercised under the options and possible additional aircraft to be contracted  in addition to those under the options  at revised pricing 
we also are reviewing our ability to claim equitable adjustment recovery from the us government related to certain costs that potentially could be incurred related to the exercise of these options 
depending on the results of the sdd contract  our cost containment efforts  the availability of us government funding  the number of aircraft exercised or ultimately contracted for  and the resolution of our discussions with the us government  we currently estimate that it is reasonably possible that our exposure could be in the range of no loss to a possible loss of million per aircraft 
this estimate excludes the impact of discussions with the us government or any potential recoveries including claims for equitable adjustment under the contracts 
due to the uncertainty of this exposure and the ultimate outcome of our discussions  we do not believe that a loss is probable under the guidelines established by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  we have not established a reserve at december  commercial business in  commercial profit decreased million  compared with primarily due to unfavorable cost performance of million and inflation of million  partially offset by higher pricing of million and the impact of increased volume and mix of million 
the unfavorable cost performance reflected increased overhead costs of million  the impact of the million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab program in  higher net research and development expense of million and the million prior year impact of the resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a collaborative research and development agreement  partially offset by million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming in for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins 
in  commercial profit increased million  compared with primarily due to the million gain on the sale of our interest in the model ab helicopter program  the million impact of higher international military volume and improved performance  higher spares volume of million and a million impact upon resolution of uncertainties and receipt of cash related to a prior year collaborative research and development sharing agreement 
in addition  commercial profit reflected a million decrease in net research and development  as higher gross research and development expenses of million were more than offset by the commercial share of reimbursements related to risk sharing agreements from codevelopment partners 
these increases were partially offset by million of higher selling and administrative expense and million in additional reserves recorded by lycoming in for a crankshaft retirement program and related service bulletins 
cessna dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin backlog demand in the business jet market continued to strengthen in  which was reflected in a increase in our backlog  despite a increase in business jet deliveries 
over the past three years  cessna has increased its annual production rate and has continued to focus on improving margins while investing in engineering  research and development in cessna s continual effort to bring new technology and products to market 
citation business jets are the largest component of cessna s revenues 
we delivered  and citation business jets in  and  respectively  representing  and of cessna s total revenues 
cessna revenues revenues at cessna increased million in  compared with due to higher volume of million  primarily related to citation business jets  and favorable pricing of million 
in  cessna s revenues increased billion  compared with primarily due to higher citation business jet volume of million  higher pricing of million and a benefit from the consolidation of citationshares of million 
cessna segment profit segment profit increased million at cessna in  compared with primarily due to higher pricing of million  the impact of higher volume of million and favorable warranty performance of million  partially offset by inflation of million and higher engineering and product development costs of million 
favorable warranty performance included the million impact of lower estimated warranty costs for aircraft sold in  as well as a million incremental benefit from other favorable warranty performance in a million benefit in compared with million in 
during initial model launches  cessna typically incurs higher warranty related costs until the production process matures  at which point warranty costs moderate 
based on historical production and warranty patterns  management estimated that the sovereign and cj production lines had reached this maturity level  and that sovereign and cj aircraft produced in the third and fourth quarter of would incur lower warranty costs than earlier production aircraft 
in  cessna s profit improved by approximately million as a result of lower point of sale warranty costs for aircraft sold during the year  primarily sovereign and cj  compared with management expects improved performance on these models to continue in the foreseeable future 
in  cessna s segment profit increased million  compared to  largely due to the million impact of higher volume across all product lines and million of higher pricing  partially offset by million of inflation 
industrial dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin the industrial segment is composed of five businesses  including e z go  jacobsen  kautex  greenlee and fluid power 
during  we experienced positive organic growth in each of this segment s businesses as we continued to focus on our customers 
both fluid power and kautex increased their presence in china to capitalize on the expanding market 
greenlee prepared to launch their new hand tool product line to complement their existing products 
in our golf and turf care businesses  we completed the sale of our commercial grounds care business  allowing us to focus on our core golf  resort  sport turf and municipal markets 
industrial revenues revenues in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with primarily due to higher volume of million  higher pricing of million and a favorable foreign exchange impact of million  partially offset by the divestiture of non core product lines of million 
revenues in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with as higher pricing of million and favorable foreign exchange of million were largely offset by lower volume of million 
the lower sales volume primarily reflected decreases of million at kautex  largely due to product model changeovers  and million at jacobsen primarily related to the strategic realignment of its north american commercial distribution network 
these decreases were partially offset by higher volume of million at greenlee 
industrial segment profit segment profit in the industrial segment increased million in  compared with mainly due to million of improved cost performance  higher pricing of million and the million impact of higher net volume and mix  partially offset by million of inflation and a million impact from divestitures of non core product lines 
segment profit in the industrial segment decreased million in  compared with largely due to inflation of million and the impact of lower volume and an unfavorable mix of million  partially offset by higher pricing of million and improved cost performance of million  primarily at kautex 
finance dollars in millions revenues segment profit profit margin during  the finance segment generated significant growth in its owned and managed finance receivables 
owned finance receivables grew by billion  up from and we expect continued growth in portfolio quality statistics reflected continued improvements in our nonperforming assets as a percentage of total finance assets decreased to at the end of  compared with at the end of and at the end of while portfolio quality statistics continue to improve  the collectibility of this segment s finance receivable portfolio remains one of its most significant business risks 
the continued strength of our portfolio quality  combined with continued reductions in the level of loan losses  resulted in a reduction of the rate utilized to establish the allowance for losses in several of our portfolios in this resulted in a million reduction in the provision for losses during we expect relative stability in our portfolio statistics during finance revenues revenues in the finance segment increased million in  compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase related to higher average finance receivables and a million increase from the higher interest rate environment  partially offset by an million decrease in other income largely due to lower fees and securitization income 
average finance receivables increased billion from levels in the corresponding period in primarily due to growth in the distribution  golf and aviation finance businesses 
revenues in the finance segment increased million in  compared with the increase was primarily due to higher finance charges and discounts of million  partially offset by lower prepayment income of million 
the increase in finance charges was largely due to a higher interest rate environment  which accounted for million of the increase  and million related to higher average finance receivables of million  partially offset by lower relative receivable pricing of million 
the increase in average finance receivables was primarily related to growth in distribution  golf and aviation finance  and asset based lending  partially offset by reductions in liquidating non core portfolios 
finance segment profit segment profit in the finance segment increased million in  compared with due to an increase in net interest margin 
the growth in average finance receivables generated million of higher net margin  which was partially offset by an million decrease in other income 
segment profit in the finance segment increased million in  compared with primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for loan losses as a result of sustained improvements in portfolio quality and an million increase in net interest margin  which was partially offset by higher selling and administrative expenses of million 
the increase in net interest margin was primarily attributable to portfolio growth 
selling and administrative expenses increased primarily due to million in higher variable compensation associated with portfolio growth and million related to improved profitability and increased pension and benefits cost 
finance portfolio quality the following table presents information about the finance segment s portfolio quality in millions  except for ratios finance receivables allowance for losses on finance receivables nonperforming assets provision for loan losses net charge offs ratio of nonperforming assets to total finance assets ratio of allowance for losses on receivables to nonaccrual finance receivables days contractual delinquency as a percentage of finance receivables nonperforming assets by business are as follows in millions golf finance resort finance asset based lending aviation finance distribution finance liquidating portfolios total nonperforming assets nonperforming assets include nonaccrual finance receivables and repossessed assets that are not guaranteed by our manufacturing group 
we believe that nonperforming assets generally will be in the range of to of finance assets depending on economic conditions 
in  the million increase in golf finance is primarily the result of two delinquent golf course mortgage loans whose operations were affected by the prolonged effects of hurricane katrina  while the million increase in asset based lending is the result of two loans in unrelated industries 
the million improvement in resort finance and the liquidating portfolios in  principally reflected charge offs against existing reserves and remedial collection activity 
in  nonperforming assets decreased primarily due to resort and golf finance  reflecting improvement in general economic conditions  partially offset by an increase in our liquidating portfolios due to two loans 
the non core liquidating portfolios continue to compose a disproportionate amount of the nonperforming assets accounting for of total nonperforming assets while comprising less than of the total finance assets at december  liquidity and capital resources our financings are conducted through two separate borrowing groups 
the manufacturing group consists of textron inc  consolidated with the entities that operate in the bell  cessna and industrial segments  while the finance group consists of the finance segment  comprised of textron financial corporation and its subsidiaries 
we designed this framework to enhance our borrowing power by separating the finance group 
our manufacturing group operations include the development  production and delivery of tangible goods and services  while our finance group provides financial services 
due to the fundamental differences between each borrowing group s activities  investors  rating agencies and analysts use different measures to evaluate each group s performance 
to support those evaluations  we present balance sheet and cash flow information for each borrowing group within the consolidated financial statements 
through our finance group  we provide diversified commercial financing to third parties 
in addition  this group finances retail purchases and leases for new and used aircraft and equipment manufactured by our manufacturing group  otherwise known as captive financing 
in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash received from customers or from securitizations is reflected as operating activities when received 
however  in the cash flow information provided for the separate borrowing groups  cash flows related to captive financing activities are reflected based on the operations of each group 
for example  when product is sold by our manufacturing group to a customer that is financed by the finance group  the origination of the finance receivable is recorded within investing activities as a cash outflow on our finance group s statement of cash flows 
meanwhile  the manufacturing group records the cash received from the finance group on the customer s behalf within operating cash flows as a cash inflow on our manufacturing group s statement of cash flows 
although cash is transferred between the two borrowing groups  there is no cash transaction reported in the consolidated cash flows at the time of the original financing 
these captive financing activities  along with all significant intercompany transactions  are reclassified or eliminated from the consolidated statements of cash flows  as detailed below in the operating cash flows of continuing operations section 
under a support agreement  textron inc is required to maintain ownership of textron financial corporation 
the agreement also requires textron inc to ensure that textron financial corporation maintains fixed charge coverage of no less than and consolidated shareholder s equity of no less than million 
operating cash flows of continuing operations in millions manufacturing group finance group reclassifications and elimination adjustments consolidated cash flows from operations are the primary source of funds for our operating needs  dividends and capital expenditures 
we analyze operating cash flows for our manufacturing group by tracking free cash flow 
we calculate free cash flow using net cash provided by operating activities  adding back proceeds on the sale of property  plant and equipment  then subtracting capital expenditures  including those financed with capital leases 
the manufacturing group s operating cash flows increased in compared with primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations and a decrease in working capital components 
consolidated operating cash flows increased primarily due to the increase in income from continuing operations for both borrowing groups and a decrease in working capital components  partially offset by a million increase in net captive financing activity as explained below 
reclassification and elimination adjustments in millions reclassifications from investing activities finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales cash received from customers and securitizations for captive financing other total reclassifications from investing activities dividends paid by finance group to manufacturing group total reclassifications and adjustments finance receivable originations for manufacturing group inventory sales increased in compared with primarily due to financings related to aircraft sales growth during the period 
however  cash received for these captive receivables decreased in as higher cash receipts from our customers were offset by million in lower proceeds from securitizations 
investing cash flows of continuing operations in millions manufacturing group finance group reclassifications to operating activities consolidated over the past three years  consolidated investing cash flows have been largely driven by increases in cash outflows at our finance group due to higher non captive finance receivable originations  net of cash collections from repayments  sales and securitizations  of million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in cash used for the manufacturing group in is largely due to the acquisition of two businesses in the bell segment for million in cash  along with an increase in capital expenditures of million 
in  the manufacturing group increased its use of cash for investing by million with million in higher capital expenditures  along with a million decrease in proceeds that were received in from the sale of c a common stock 
the increases in capital expenditures in and are primarily related to higher spending at the bell segment in response to increased production demands 
capital expenditures related to our manufacturing operations totaled million in  million in and million in  including expenditures purchased through capital leases of million in  million in and million in financing cash flows of continuing operations in millions manufacturing group finance group dividends paid by finance group to manufacturing group consolidated our manufacturing group used million more cash for financing activities in compared with the increase is primarily due to the paydown of million of short term debt in compared with the issuance of million of short term debt in  and to a million increase in purchases of our common stock 
our manufacturing group used less cash for financing activities in than in principally due to the issuance of the short term debt in and the retirement of debt of million in  partially offset by a million increase in purchases of our common stock and million in lower proceeds from employee stock ownership plans 
our finance group has continued to increase its debt outstanding over the past three years to fund asset growth 
stock repurchases in  and  we repurchased approximately   and  shares of common stock  respectively  under board authorized share repurchase programs for an aggregate cost of million  million and million  respectively 
on january   our board of directors authorized a new million share repurchase program of which million shares remained at december  dividends on january   the board of directors authorized a per share increase in our annualized common stock dividend to per share 
dividend payments to shareholders totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the timing of our quarterly dividend payments resulted in five payments in  four payments in and three payments in discontinued operations cash flows in millions operating activities investing activities financing activities discontinued operations cash flows from investing activities increased in primarily due to net cash proceeds of million related to the sale of the fastening systems business 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details concerning our discontinued operations 
capital resources the debt net of cash to capital ratio for our manufacturing group as of december  was  compared with at december   and the gross debt to capital ratio as of december  was  compared with at december  the ratio reflects the adoption of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statement nos 
   r 
our manufacturing group targets a gross debt to capital ratio that is consistent with an a rated company 
consistent with the methodology used by members of the financial community  leverage of the manufacturing group excludes the debt of our finance group 
in turn  our finance group limits its borrowings to an amount  taking into account the risk profile of its assets  consistent with a single a credit rating 
surplus capital of textron financial corporation is returned to textron inc borrowings historically have been a secondary source of funds for our manufacturing group and  along with the collection of finance receivables  are a primary source of funds for our finance group 
both borrowing groups utilize a broad base of financial sources for their respective liquidity and capital needs 
our credit ratings are predominantly a function of our ability to generate operating cash flows and satisfy certain financial ratios 
since high quality credit ratings provide us with access to a broad base of global investors at an attractive cost  we target a long term a rating from the independent debt rating agencies 
the credit ratings and outlooks of these three debt rating agencies by borrowing group are as follows standard fitch moody s poor s long term ratings manufacturing a a a finance a a a short term ratings manufacturing f p a finance f p a outlook positive stable stable we have a policy of maintaining unused committed bank lines of credit in an amount not less than outstanding commercial paper balances 
these facilities are in support of commercial paper and letters of credit issuances only  and neither of these primary lines of credit was drawn at december  or december  our primary committed credit facilities at december  include the following amount not reserved as support for commercial letters of commercial facility paper credit paper and in millions amount outstanding outstanding letters of credit manufacturing group multi year facility expiring in finance group multi year facility expiring in the finance group is permitted to borrow under this multi year facility 
under a shelf registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission  the manufacturing group may issue public debt and other securities in one or more offerings up to a total maximum offering of billion 
at december   we had billion available under the manufacturing group s registration statement 
during the fourth quarter of  the finance group renewed a previously filed statement to enable it to issue an unlimited amount of public debt 
our finance group issued billion of term debt and cad million of term debt during under its registration statements 
we used the proceeds from these issuances to fund receivable growth and repay short term debt 
contractual obligations manufacturing group the following table summarizes the known contractual obligations of our manufacturing group to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied payment due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total liabilities reflected in balance sheet long term debt a capital lease obligations a pension benefits for unfunded plans b postretirement benefits other than pensions b other long term liabilities c liabilities not reflected in balance sheet operating leases a purchase obligations d total manufacturing group a long term debt and capital lease obligations exclude interest payments 
operating leases represent undiscounted obligations under noncancelable leases 
b we maintain defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans other than pensions as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
included in the table above are discounted estimated benefit payments we expect to make related to unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
actual benefit payments are dependent on a number of factors  including mortality assumptions  expected retirement age  rate of compensation increases and medical trend rates  which are subject to change in future years 
we also expect to make contributions to our funded pension plans in the range of approximately million to million per year over the next five years  which are not reflected in this table 
c other long term liabilities primarily include undiscounted amounts on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  representing obligations under deferred compensation arrangements and estimated environmental remediation costs 
payments under deferred compensation arrangements have been estimated based on management s assumptions of expected retirement age  mortality  stock price and rates of return on participant deferrals 
timing of cash flows associated with environmental remediation costs are largely based on historical experience 
many of our other long term liabilities have been excluded from the table due to the uncertainty of the timing of payments combined with the absence of historical trends to be used as a predictor for such payments 
these excluded liabilities primarily include deferred income taxes 
d purchase obligations represent undiscounted obligations for which we are committed to purchase goods and services as of december  the ultimate liability for these obligations may be reduced based upon termination provisions included in certain purchase contracts  the costs incurred to date by vendors under these contracts or by recourse under firm contracts with the us government under normal termination clauses 
in january  we contracted with a third party service provider for the oversight of our information technology infrastructure  including maintenance  operational oversight and purchases of hardware the it contract 
the it contract covers a year period and is subject to variable pricing and quantity provisions for both purchases of computer hardware and system design modifications 
we have retained the right to approve significant design  equipment purchase and related decisions by the service provider 
we can terminate the it contract for convenience prior to its full term and would consequently be subject to variable termination fees that decline over time and do not exceed million at december finance group the following table summarizes our finance group s known contractual obligations to make future payments 
due to the nature of finance companies  we also have contractual cash receipts that will be received in the future 
we generally borrow funds at various contractual maturities to match the maturities of our finance receivables 
the contractual payments and receipts as of december  are detailed below payments receipts due by period less than more than in millions year years years years years years total contractual payments commercial paper and other short term debt term debt operating leases total contractual payments cash and receipts finance receivables operating leases total receipts cash total cash and receipts net cash and receipts payments cumulative net cash and receipts finance receivable receipts related to finance leases and term loans are based on contractual cash flows 
finance receivable receipts related to revolving loans are based on historical cash flow experience 
these amounts could differ due to prepayments  charge offs and other factors 
receipts and contractual payments exclude finance charges from receivables  debt interest payments  proceeds from sale of operating lease equipment and other items 
as shown in the preceding table  our cash and receipts are expected to be sufficient to cover maturing debt and other contractual liabilities 
at december   our finance group had billion in debt and million in other liabilities that are payable within the next months 
at december   our finance group had unused commitments to fund new and existing customers under billion of committed revolving lines of credit  compared with billion at december  these loan commitments generally have an original duration of less than three years and do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  since many of the agreements will not be used to the extent committed or will expire unused 
we are not exposed to interest rate changes on these commitments since the interest rates are not set until the loans are funded 
off balance sheet arrangements and guarantees we extend a variety of financial and performance guarantees to third parties as provided in the table below december  december  maximum carrying maximum carrying potential amount of potential amount of in millions payment liability payment liability manufacturing group performance guarantee guaranteed minimum resale contracts guarantees related to dispositions debt obligations of joint ventures finance group loss sharing agreements these agreements include uncapped guarantees as described below 
performance guarantee in  through our bell helicopter business  we formed agustawestlandbell llc awb llc with agustawestland north america inc awna 
this venture was created for the joint design  development  manufacture  sale  customer training and product support of the vh helicopter  and certain variations and derivatives thereof  to be offered and sold to departments or agencies of the us government 
in march  awb llc received a billion cost reimbursement type subcontract from lockheed martin for the system development and demonstration phase of the us marine corps helicopter squadron program 
we guaranteed to lockheed martin the due and prompt performance by awb llc of all its obligations under this subcontract  provided that our liability under the guaranty shall not exceed of awb llc s aggregate liability to lockheed martin under the subcontract 
agustawestland nv  awna s parent company  has guaranteed the remaining to lockheed martin 
we have entered into cross indemnification agreements with agustawestland nv in which each party indemnifies the other related to any payments required under these agreements that result from the indemnifying party s workshare under any subcontracts received 
for  awb llc s maximum obligation was of the total contract value  which equates to million based on the current contract value of billion 
in and thereafter  awb llc s maximum obligation increases to  or million 
accordingly  the maximum amount of our liability under the guarantee was million at december  and will be million thereafter through completion 
guaranteed minimum resale contracts we have a number of guaranteed minimum resale value contracts associated with certain past aircraft sales 
if the fair value of an aircraft falls below a minimum guaranteed amount  we may be required to make a future payment to the customer or provide a minimum trade in value toward a new aircraft 
these agreements generally include operating restrictions such as maximum usage over the contract period or minimum maintenance requirements 
we also have guaranteed the minimum resale value of certain customer owned aircraft anticipated to be traded in upon completion of a model currently under development 
these contracts expire as follows million in  million in  million in  million in and million in guarantees related to dispositions we have guaranteed payment on certain credit facilities and bank issued letters of credit and guarantees of the fastening systems business  where the total guarantee is capped at approximately million  for which the buyer has provided a letter of credit of approximately million as collateral 
we also have guaranteed payment and performance on certain other credit facilities and leases of the fastening systems business totaling approximately million  where we also are liable for unpaid interest  fees and other costs associated with claims that may arise from these guarantees 
while potential interest and fees are not capped  we have monitoring provisions that mitigate the exposure to these additional costs 
the buyer has provided a letter of credit of approximately million as collateral on these guarantees 
we also have indemnified the purchaser of the fastening systems business for remediation costs related to pre existing environmental conditions to the extent they exist at the sold locations 
we have estimated the fair value of these indemnifications at approximately million 
potential payments under these obligations are not capped  and as a result the maximum potential obligation cannot be determined 
in connection with the disposition of trim to subsidiaries of c a  certain equipment and operating leases were transferred and assigned to subsidiaries of c a 
we guaranteed c a s payments under these leases and for an environmental matter 
we also have obligations arising from sales of certain other businesses  including representations and warranties and related indemnities for environmental  health and safety  and tax and employment matters 
the maximum potential payment related to these obligations is not a specified amount as a number of the obligations do not contain financial caps 
loss sharing agreements in connection with the sale of a note receivable in  our finance group has indemnified the purchaser against potential losses in limited circumstances 
the maximum potential exposure of the indemnity is estimated to be million  but due to the extremely low probability of occurrence and several other mitigating factors  including a specific indemnification from the original note issuer  no significant fair value has been attributed to the indemnity 
in connection with the sale of the small business direct financing business in  our finance group entered into a loss sharing agreement 
this agreement required us to reimburse the purchaser for of losses incurred on the portfolio above a annual level 
a liability of million was originally recorded representing the estimated fair value of the guarantee 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a settlement agreement with the purchaser  which terminated our obligation to reimburse the purchaser for future losses 
the settlement resulted in a million loss  net of tax  from discontinued operations in at december   our finance group had a contingent liability related to the sale of equipment lease streams with a maximum liability of million 
these lease streams were sold in  and we had no remaining liability at the end of software indemnifications with the acquisition of overwatch systems in  we now are a party to software license agreements with customers 
these software license agreements generally include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against liabilities if our software products infringe a third party s intellectual property rights 
to date  we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such indemnifications and have not accrued any liabilities related to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements 
forward contract we enter into a forward contract in our common stock on an annual basis 
the contract is intended to hedge the earnings and cash volatility of stock based incentive compensation indexed to our stock 
the forward contract requires annual cash settlement between the counterparties based upon a number of shares multiplied by the difference between the strike price and the prevailing common stock price 
as of december   the contract was for approximately million shares with a strike price of 
the market price of the stock was at december   resulting in a receivable of million  compared with a receivable of million at december  finance receivable securitizations and sales we sell finance receivables utilizing both securitizations and whole loan sales 
as a result of these transactions  finance receivables are removed from the balance sheet  and the proceeds received are used to reduce the recorded debt levels 
despite the reduction in the recorded balance sheet position  we generally retain a subordinated interest in the finance receivables sold through securitizations  which may affect operating results through periodic fair value adjustments 
these retained interests are more fully discussed in the securitizations section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
we utilize these off balance sheet financing arrangements primarily asset backed securitizations to further diversify funding alternatives 
these arrangements provided net proceeds from operations of million and million in and  respectively 
proceeds from securitizations include amounts received related to incremental increases in the level of distribution finance receivables sold and exclude amounts received related to the ongoing replenishment of the outstanding sold balance of these short duration receivables 
we have used the proceeds from these arrangements to fund the origination of new finance receivables and to retire commercial paper 
whole loan finance receivable sales in which we maintain a continuing interest differ from securitizations as loans are sold directly to investors and no portion of the sale proceeds is deferred 
limited credit enhancement occasionally is provided for these transactions in the form of a contingent liability related to finance receivable credit losses and  to a lesser extent  prepayment risk 
at december   we had no remaining contingent liabilities related to credit losses or prepayment risk associated with whole loan sales 
termination of our off balance sheet financing arrangements would reduce our short term funding alternatives 
while these arrangements do not contain provisions that require us to repurchase significant amounts of receivables previously sold  there are risks that could reduce the availability of these funding alternatives in the future 
potential barriers to the continued use of these arrangements include deterioration in finance receivable portfolio quality  downgrades in our finance group s debt credit ratings and a reduction of new finance receivable originations in the businesses that utilize these funding arrangements 
we do not expect any of these factors to have a material impact on our liquidity or income from operations 
critical accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements to be in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we must make complex and subjective judgments in the selection and application of accounting policies 
the accounting policies that we believe are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations are listed below 
we believe these policies require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements  which includes other significant accounting policies 
allowance for losses on finance receivables our allowance for losses on finance receivables is intended to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio  which requires the application of estimates and significant judgment as to the ultimate outcome of collection efforts and realization of collateral values  among other factors 
therefore  changes in economic conditions or credit metrics  including past due and nonperforming accounts  or other events affecting specific obligors or industries may require additions or reductions to our reserves 
we evaluate the collectibility of our finance receivables based on a combination of factors 
for homogeneous loan pools  we examine current delinquencies  characteristics of the existing accounts  historical loss experience  underlying collateral value  and general economic conditions and trends 
we estimate losses will range from to of finance receivables depending on the specific homogeneous loan pool 
for larger balance commercial loans  we also consider borrower specific information  industry trends and estimated discounted cash flows 
our process involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment 
while we believe that our consideration of the factors and assumptions referred to above results in an accurate evaluation of existing losses in the portfolio based on prior trends and experience  changes in the assumptions or trends within reasonable historical volatility may have a material impact on our allowance for losses 
the allowance for losses on finance receivables currently represents of total finance receivables 
during the last five years  net charge offs as a percentage of finance receivables have ranged from to 
long term contracts we make a substantial portion of our sales to government customers pursuant to long term contracts 
these contracts require development and delivery of products over multiple years and may contain fixed price purchase options for additional products 
we accounted for these long term contracts under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the contract term based on either input eg  costs incurred under the cost to cost method  which typically is used for development effort or output eg  units delivered under the units of delivery method  which is used for production effort  as appropriate under the circumstances 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion and  in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total contract costs and revenue through completion is complicated and subject to many variables relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years 
we are required to make numerous assumptions and estimates relating to items such as expected engineering requirements  complexity of design and related development costs  performance of subcontractors  availability and cost of materials  labor productivity and cost  overhead and capital costs  manufacturing efficiencies and the achievement of contract milestones  including product deliveries 
our cost estimation process is based on the professional knowledge and experience of engineers and program managers along with finance professionals 
we update our projections of costs at least semiannually or when circumstances significantly change 
adjustments to projected costs are recognized in earnings when determinable 
anticipated losses on contracts are recognized in full in the period in which losses become probable and estimable 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different revenues and or cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
our earnings could be reduced by a material amount resulting in a charge to earnings if a total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than expected due to changes in customer specifications prior to contract amendment  b total estimated contract costs are significantly higher than previously estimated due to cost overruns or inflation  c there is a change in engineering efforts required during the development stage of the contract or d we are unable to meet contract milestones 
goodwill we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of using the estimates from our long term strategic plans 
no adjustment was required to the carrying value of our goodwill based on the analysis performed 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology using assumptions consistent with market participants 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts represent our best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected by each reporting unit based on the current cost structure and anticipated net cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these forecasts  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
the impact of reducing our fair value estimates by would have no impact on our goodwill assessment  with the exception of two reporting units as described below 
assuming a reduction in our fair value estimates  the carrying value of these reporting units would approximate or exceed fair value 
our operating plans and projections anticipate investments in capital expenditures at our fluid handling products reporting unit to resolve current capacity issues as well as to capture additional business in the oil and gas markets over the next two years 
the related volume increases are anticipated to result in approximately annual operating profit growth over this period 
in the remaining five year planning period  we anticipate an annual operating profit growth rate of approximately  driven by anticipated revenue growth of annually with increased profit margins from improvements resulting from ongoing transformation efforts 
should the revenue growth rates over the next two years approximate historical levels  the estimated fair value would be reduced by up to approximately million and may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
at december   the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit totaled approximately million 
our operating plans and projections for the golf and turf care reporting unit anticipate operating margin improvements over the five year planning period resulting in high single digit margins  with anticipated annual revenue growth of approximately 
a basis point decline in our operating margin assumptions would reduce the estimated fair value by up to approximately million and may result in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its estimated fair value  potentially resulting in an impairment charge 
at december   the goodwill allocated to this reporting unit totaled approximately million 
retirement benefits we maintain various pension and postretirement plans for our employees globally 
these plans include significant pension and postretirement benefit obligations  which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions used in determining these obligations and related expenses include expected long term rates of return on plan assets  discount rates and healthcare cost projections 
we evaluate and update these assumptions annually in consultation with third party actuaries and investment advisors 
we also make assumptions regarding employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
a lower expected rate of return on plan assets will increase pension expense 
for  the assumed expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in calculating pension expense was  compared with in in and  the assumed rate of return for our qualified domestic plans  which represent approximately of our total pension obligations  was 
a basis point decrease in this long term rate of return would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
this rate should be in line with rates for high quality fixed income investments available for the period to maturity of the pension benefits  which fluctuate as long term interest rates change 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
in  we lowered the weighted average discount rate used in calculating pension expense to from in for our qualified domestic plans  the assumed discount rate was for a basis point decrease in this discount rate would result in a million annual increase in pension expense for our qualified domestic plans 
the trend in healthcare costs is difficult to estimate  and it has an important effect on postretirement liabilities 
the medical and prescription drug healthcare cost trend rates represent the weighted average annual projected rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits 
the medical rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
the prescription drug rate of is assumed to decrease to by and then remain at that level 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of a one percentage point change in the cost trend rate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates that we expect to be in effect for the year in which we expect the differences will reverse 
based on the evaluation of available evidence  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize these benefits 
we periodically assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets and reflect any changes in our estimates in the valuation allowance  with a corresponding adjustment to earnings or other comprehensive income loss  as appropriate 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we look to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities due to closure of income tax examinations  new regulatory or judicial pronouncements  or other relevant events 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
recently announced accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation provides a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
we will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of and do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction 
this staff position amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases and requires a recalculation of returns on leveraged leases if there is a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows related to income taxes generated by the leveraged lease 
in accordance with this guidance  the difference between the revised calculation of earnings since lease inception and the actual amount of cumulative earnings recognized is recorded in income from continuing operations 
we are required to adopt this guidance in the first quarter of upon adoption  the estimated change in the projected cash flows must be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the adoption of this staff position resulted in a million reduction in retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single definition  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
this statement applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning subsequent to november  we will adopt this statement in the first quarter of and currently are evaluating its impact on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risks our financial results are affected by changes in us and foreign interest rates 
as part of managing this risk  we enter into interest rate exchange agreements to convert certain floating rate debt to fixed rate debt and vice versa 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management is to achieve a prudent balance between floating and fixed rate debt 
we continually monitor our mix of floating and fixed rate debt and adjust the mix  as necessary  based on our evaluation of internal and external factors 
the difference between the rates our manufacturing group received and the rates it paid on interest rate exchange agreements did not significantly impact interest expense in  or our finance group limits its risk to changes in interest rates with its strategy of matching floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities 
this strategy includes the use of interest rate exchange agreements 
at december   floating rate liabilities in excess of floating rate assets were million  net of billion of interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted fixed rate debt to a floating rate equivalent  and million of interest rate exchange agreements that effectively converted fixed rate finance receivables to a floating rate equivalent 
interest rate exchange agreements designated as hedges of debt had the net effect of increasing interest expense for our finance group by million in and decreasing interest expense by million and million in and  respectively 
foreign exchange risks our financial results are affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the foreign markets in which products are manufactured and or sold 
for  the impact of foreign exchange rate changes from increased revenues by approximately million and increased segment profit by approximately million for our manufacturing operations  we manage exposures to foreign currency assets and earnings primarily by funding certain foreign currency denominated assets with liabilities in the same currency so that certain exposures are naturally offset 
we primarily use borrowings denominated in euro and british pound sterling for these purposes 
in managing its foreign currency transaction exposures  we also enter into foreign currency forward exchange and option contracts 
these contracts generally are used to fix the local currency cost of purchased goods or services or selling prices denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
the notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts  foreign currency options and currency swaps was approximately million at the end of and million at the end of quantitative risk measures in the normal course of business  we enter into financial instruments for purposes other than trading 
to quantify the market risk inherent in our financial instruments  we utilize a sensitivity analysis 
the financial instruments that are subject to market risk interest rate risk  foreign exchange rate risk and equity price risk include finance receivables excluding lease receivables  debt excluding lease obligations  interest rate exchange agreements  foreign currency exchange contracts and marketable security price forward contracts 
presented below is a sensitivity analysis of the fair value of financial instruments outstanding at year end 
we estimate the fair value of the financial instruments using discounted cash flow analysis and independent investment bankers 
this sensitivity analysis is most likely not indicative of actual results in the future
