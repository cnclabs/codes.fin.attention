during the fiscal year ended june   the company changed its reporting segments to nutraceuticals  pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies from nutraceutical  pharmaceutical and technical services 
the company currently manages its business in these segments 
the prior year reported data as been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
the company is engaged primarily in the manufacturing  distributing  marketing and sales of vitamins  nutritional supplements and herbal products  the manufacture and distribution of paclitaxel  which is the primary chemotherapeutic agent in the treatment of breast cancer  technical services through its contract research organization  and the biotechnology business  which uses its patented plant based technology to produce vaccines and therapeutic antibodies 
the company s customers are located primarily throughout the united states 
for the fiscal year ended june   our net sales increased million or to million from million for the fiscal year ended june  the fourth quarter net sales for the current fiscal year as compared to the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year decreased approximately million or 
the decreased sales was primarily due to the nutraceutical segment s net sales which decreased approximately  offset by net sales growth in the pharmaceutical segment of million and in the biotechnology segment of million for the fourth quarter ended june  as compared to the fourth quarter ended june  in may  we updated our net sales forecast downward for the fiscal year ended  as major chain retailers announced decreases in consumer spending due to the widespread severe weather conditions and a spike in gasoline prices 
this resulted in a decrease in the rate of requested shipments from our major nutraceutical customers in the remainder of the fourth quarter for the fiscal year ended additionally  we expanded our branded nutraceutical product lines being offered in our club store distribution channel from an average of three products to four  while our new products were selling through to the consumers  they were not selling through at the same levels of our other three products and our net sales for our existing products were offset by sales returns and allowances of these new products 
in addition to lower net sales in the quarter  we also recorded approximately million of inventory valuation adjustments on certain new products in our naturally branded product lines 
we remain optimistic about the long term performance of our nutraceutical segment and we expect to continue to support our product lines with the necessary promotional advertising to enhance sales in the fiscal year and beyond 
critical accounting policies and estimates estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the most significant estimates include sales returns and allowances  trade marketing and merchandising  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  valuation and recoverability of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  including the values assigned to acquired intangible assets  income taxes and valuation allowances on deferred income taxes  and accruals for  and the probability of  the outcome of current litigation 
on a continual basis  management reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information  changes in facts and circumstances  historical experience and reasonable assumptions 
after such reviews  and if deemed appropriate  those estimates are adjusted accordingly 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns the company makes judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provides allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding amounts 
we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the period they become known 
the company s return policy is to only accept returns for defective products 
if defective products are returned  it is the company s agreement with its customers that the company cure the defect and reship the product 
the policy is that when the product is shipped we make an estimate of any potential returns or allowances 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
in recording any additional allowances  a respective charge against income is reflected in the general and administrative expenses  and would reduce the operating results in the period in which the increase is recorded 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of fluctuations in our estimates for our allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of june   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
if this amount were in error by plus or minus one percent of the account receivable balance  the impact would be an additional million of income or expense 
trade marketing and merchandising 
in order to support the company s propriety nutraceutical product lines  various promotional activities are conducted through the retail trade  distributors or directly with consumers  including in store display and product placement programs  feature price discounts  coupons  and other similar activities 
the company regularly reviews and revises  when it deems necessary  estimates of costs to the company for these promotional programs based on estimates of what will be redeemed by the retail trade  distributors  or consumers 
these estimates are made using various techniques  including historical data on performance of similar promotional programs 
differences between estimated expense and actual performance are generally not material and are recognized as a change in management s estimate in a subsequent period 
as the company s total promotional expenditures  including amounts classified as a reduction of net sales  represent approximately percent of net sales  the likelihood exists of materially different reported results if factors such as the level and success of the promotional programs or other conditions differ from expectations 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market lcm  which reflects management s estimates of net realizable value 
the inventory amounts are composed primarily of inventory items in both the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical segments of business 
as a result of our nutraceutical inventory being manufactured primarily on a purchase order basis  the quantity of both raw materials and finished goods inventory provides for minimal risk for potential overstock or obsolescence 
our pharmaceutical inventory is valued at market values  which is lower than our cost basis 
mail order inventory is expiration date sensitive 
the company reviews this inventory and considers sales levels by sku  term to expiration date  potential for retesting to extend expiration date and evaluates potential for obsolescence or overstock 
the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of fluctuations in our estimates for inventory allowances 
if our estimates used to value inventory were off by one percent of the total inventory balance  the impact would be an additional million of income or expense 
long lived assets purchased intangibles consisting of patents and unpatented technological expertise  intellectual property  license fees and trade names purchased as part of business acquisitions are presented net of related accumulated amortization and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the remaining useful lives 
the company records impairment losses on other intangible assets when events and circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired and the estimated fair value of the asset is less than its recorded amount in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company reviews the value of its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include material adverse changes in operations  significant adverse differences in actual results in comparison with initial valuation forecasts prepared at the time of acquisition  a decision to abandon certain acquired products  services  or marketplaces  or other significant adverse changes that would indicate the carrying amount of the recorded asset might not be recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized against earnings  but instead tested for impairment at least annually based on a fair value approach as described in sfas intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the useful life of an intangible asset is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
the carrying value of intangible assets with finite lives is evaluated whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying value is not recoverable when the projected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value 
tests for impairment or recoverability require significant management judgment  and future events affecting cash flows and market conditions could result in impairment losses 
deferred taxes the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas is an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences and events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
in the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized an income tax benefit  net of approximately million 
the income tax benefit was primarily the result of the increase in the company s federal deferred tax assets of million off set by the increase in the valuation reserve of million on the deferred tax assets and the current fiscal year federal  state and local provisions of million 
in the fourth quarter ended june   the company  based on then current factors relating to its business environment  had reasonable belief that it would have future federal taxable income which would allow the company to realize its deferred tax assets in the future and consequently  it released the portion of its valuation allowance relating to those assets 
the company continues to reasonable believe that it will have future federal taxable income to realize its deferred tax assets 
general litigation from time to time  the company is a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions which arise in the normal course of business 
as such the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of the provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease the company s earnings in the period the changes are made 
in the opinion of management  after consultation with legal counsel  the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
general the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin the company recognizes product sales revenue  the prices of which are fixed and determinable  when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  when estimated provisions for product returns  rebates  charge backs and other sales allowances are reasonably determinable  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accruals for these items are presented in the consolidated financial statements as reductions to sales 
the company s net sales represent gross sales invoiced to customers  less certain related charges for discounts  returns  rebates  charge backs and other allowances 
cost of sales includes the cost of raw materials and all labor and overhead associated with the manufacturing and packaging of the products 
gross margins are affected by  among other things  changes in the relative sales mix among the company s products  as well as gross margins of acquired entities 
operating results in all periods presented reflect the impact of acquisitions 
the timing of those acquisitions and the changing mix of businesses as acquired companies are integrated into the company may affect the comparability of results from one period to another

the decrease of approximately million was mainly attributable to an increase in interest expense due to the ongoing increase in the libor rate 
income tax benefit 
in the fiscal year ended june   the company recognized an income tax benefit of million

seasonality the company s results of operations in its pharmaceuticals and biotechnologies segments are not significantly affected by seasonal factors 
the nutraceutical business segment tends to be seasonal 
the company has found that in its first fiscal quarter ending in september  orders for its branded proprietary nutraceutical products slow absent the addition of new customers with a significant first time order  as buyers in their markets may have purchased sufficient inventory to carry them through the summer months 
conversely  in the company s second fiscal quarter  ending in december  orders for its products increase as the demand for the company s branded nutraceutical products seems to increase in late december to early january as consumers become health conscious as they enter the new year 
the company believes that there are other non seasonal factors that also may also influence the variability of quarterly results including  but not limited to  general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending  changing consumer demands and current news on nutritional supplements 
in addition  our recent growth has caused additional variability in our quarterly results 
accordingly  a comparison of the company s results of operations from consecutive periods is not necessarily meaningful  and the company s results of operations for any period are not necessarily indicative of future periods 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the company s net cash flows used in operating  investing and financing activities

after excluding the effects of non cash expenses of million for the fiscal year ended compared to non cash expenses of million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of million  which is mainly attributable to having net loss in fiscal year  as compared to a net income in fiscal year non cash items include deferred taxes  impairment charges  depreciation and amortization and compensation expense for employee stock options
