 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which provides criteria for the recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure of uncertain tax positions 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
the provisions of fin were effective for the company s fiscal year beginning april  we do not expect fin will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of effects of the prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the sec staff believes registrants must quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for the first annual period ending after november  with early application encouraged 
the company adopted sab in fiscal the company does not believe that any other recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting standards  if currently adopted  will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  temporary investments  accounts receivable  accounts payable  line of credit  and debt obligations 
the book values of cash equivalents  temporary investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable are considered to be representative of fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
at march   we had no debt obligations 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and we do not hold any derivative financial instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
the company has no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect this movement may have on other variables including changes in revenue volumes that could be indirectly attributed to changes in interest rates 
the actions that management would take in response to such a change are also not considered 
if it were possible to quantify this impact  the results could well be different than the sensitivity effects shown above
