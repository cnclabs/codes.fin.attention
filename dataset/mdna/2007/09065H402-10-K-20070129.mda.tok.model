item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and risk factors the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report and with the information contained elsewhere in this report under the captions cautionary statement regarding forward looking information and risk factors 
overview as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have raised approximately million  after expenses  from the sale of common stock and warrants since the end of fiscal we believe that these funds  together with our cash on hand at october   will be sufficient to fund operations through august because our funds on hand and forecasted sales for fiscal are expected to be insufficient to fund our operations into fiscal  the audit report of ernst young llp  our independent registered public accounting firm  on our fiscal financial statements includes a going concern modification 
the report states that our recurring losses from operations and the current lack of sufficient funds to sustain our operations through the fourth quarter of fiscal raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we will require significant additional capital to fund our operations until such time  if ever  as we become profitable 
we intend to seek additional capital through public or private sales of equity securities and  if appropriate  consider corporate collaborations for sharing development and commercialization costs 
we also plan to continue to aggressively manage expenses  after reducing our workforce and other expenses in recent years 
these cost cutting measures included reducing our manufacturing operations and thus limiting production and sales of oxyglobin 
we expect that our operating activities and expenditures for fiscal will be associated primarily with developing hemopure for an ischemia indication and for a trauma indication 
we expect to continue to work to stabilize and enhance our financial position by raising additional capital 
a number of factors pose uncertainties in estimating the amount of funds we may need to sustain operations  including the process of obtaining regulatory marketing approval of hemopure has risks of delays that make the ultimate development cost unpredictable 
we are hopeful that we can respond to the issues the fda and the mhra have raised to date in order to proceed to develop hemopure for an ischemia indication and for use in trauma patients 
as described in note to the financial statements  we are a defendant in two litigation matters 
the outcomes and financial effects of these matters cannot be determined at this time  nor can any adverse effect they may have on the price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital from sales of equity or otherwise 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the application of our critical accounting policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require us to make subjective judgments in determining estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following critical accounting policies meet these characteristics and are considered most significant inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined using the first in  first out method or market 
inventories consist of raw material  work in process and hemopure and oxyglobin finished goods 
both oxyglobin and hemopure for sale have a measured shelf life of years from the date of manufacture 
for clinical trial use the shelf life of hemopure is years 
inventories are reviewed periodically to identify expired units and units with a 
table of contents remaining life too short to be commercially viable based on projected and historical sales activity 
inventories are also subject to internal quality compliance investigations 
inventory that falls into these categories is written off 
the inventory of hemopure finished goods represents the units we expect to sell in south africa or use in reimbursable preclinical and clinical studies 
we have been and expect to continue to be reimbursed for the cost of units to be used in a proposed trauma trial to be conducted by or on behalf of the us naval medical research center nmrc 
the nmrc has advanced funds for reimbursement of a portion of the units required for its trial 
any units expected to be consumed by us in our own preclinical or clinical trials are expensed when manufactured 
if we experience future delays in sales in south africa or in the use of hemopure by the nmrc  additional writeoffs for inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards r  share based payment sfas r  beginning november   using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires us to measure the cost of employee services in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date the award is made and to recognize cost over the requisite service period 
under the modified prospective transition method  financial statements for periods prior to the date of adoption are not retrospectively adjusted 
however  compensation expense is recognized for a all share based payments granted after the effective date under sfas r  and b all awards granted under sfas to employees prior to the effective date that remain unvested on the effective date 
we recognize compensation expense on fixed awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
prior to november   we used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
consequently  we did not recognize compensation expense in association with options granted at or above the market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
as of october   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense  net of forfeitures  related to non vested market based share awards  that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
refer to note to the condensed consolidated financial statements for further discussion and analysis of the impact of adoption in our statement of operations 
long lived assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our investments in property and equipment  such as construction in progress and new facility construction  real property license rights related to the source  supply and initial processing of our major raw material  and the asset related to the expenditures for a planned manufacturing facility in south carolina are the principal long lived assets that could be subject to such a review 
pursuant to sfas  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed our long lived assets for potential impairment  with a particular emphasis on the asset related to a planned south carolina manufacturing facility 
as part of the review  we considered the potential timing of construction activities  the extent to which the asset is site specific  and our ongoing plan to ultimately build a new facility in south carolina 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also considered the projected start date of the navy s proposed resus clinical trial of hemopure and the clinical hold the fda had placed on this trial 
while delays in obtaining financing for this facility and delays in obtaining fda approval for hemopure are significant and therefore indicators of potential impairment  the sales resulting from an approval of hemopure in an ischemia or trauma indication  if obtained  would  in our view  ultimately exceed our current manufacturing capability 
based upon sfas  using an estimated undiscounted cash flow of the proposed facility  we believe that  if we obtained fda approval of hemopure for an ischemia indication  our plan for the south carolina manufacturing facility  to which we are still committed  is still viable 
furthermore we expect to finance the proposed facility in the future on commercially reasonable terms and generate 
table of contents sufficient positive future cash flows to recover our investment in the facility 
therefore  we determined that no impairment exists on the facility at october  evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
circumstances with respect to the south carolina manufacturing facility  or other long lived assets  actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of hemopure and oxyglobin upon shipment  provided that there is evidence of a final arrangement  there are no uncertainties surrounding acceptance  title has passed  collectibility is probable and the price is fixed or determinable 
hemopure marketing in south africa is directed toward doctors in hospitals in both the private and government sectors 
we sell oxyglobin directly to veterinarians in the united states and to a distributor in the united kingdom for resale in the european union 
collectibility is reasonably assured once pricing arrangements are established  as these arrangements establish the distributor s intent to pay 
our customers do not have a right to return product 
we monitor creditworthiness on a regular basis and believe collectibility of product revenues is reasonably assured at the time of sale 
we recognize revenue from the us military upon invoicing for reimbursable expenses incurred in connection with developing hemopure for a trauma indication 
amounts received for future inventory purchases  recorded as deferred revenue  will be recognized upon shipment in accordance with the provisions discussed above 
research and development since our founding in  we have been primarily a research and development company focused on developing hemopure  our oxygen therapeutic for human use  and obtaining regulatory approval in the united states and other markets 
our research and development expenses have been devoted to basic research  product development  process development  preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory activity 
in addition  our development expenses in the past included the design  construction  validation and maintenance of a large scale pilot manufacturing plant in cambridge  massachusetts 
the existing plant was completed in  expanded in and expanded again in a facility is a necessary part of developing a product like hemopure 
the fda classifies hemopure as a biologic because it is derived from animal source material 
unlike drugs that are chemical compounds  biologics are defined by their manufacturing process and composition 
under fda regulations  any change in the manufacturing process could be considered to produce an altered  possibly different product 
therefore  it is necessary to demonstrate manufacturing capability at greater than laboratory scale for an application for regulatory approval of a biologic to be accepted for review 
this requirement can result in high manufacturing research and development costs in the development of a biologic relative to other types of drugs 
prior to  we only manufactured product for use in preclinical and clinical trials  and production costs were charged wholly to research and development 
as an offshoot of the research and development for hemopure  oxyglobin  a similar product  gained approval for veterinary use in oxyglobin was then produced for sale in the pilot manufacturing plant that was built and maintained primarily for the development of hemopure 
costs of production of oxyglobin for sale and an allocation of manufacturing overhead based on capacity used for oxyglobin are charged to oxyglobin inventory and to cost of oxyglobin revenues 
since marketing approval was received for hemopure in south africa in  costs of production of hemopure for sale and an allocation of manufacturing overhead based on capacity used for hemopure have been charged to hemopure inventory and to cost of hemopure revenues 
results of operations as we generate net losses  the key drivers of the losses are cost of revenues  research and development and other expenses consisting of sales and marketing and general and administrative 
inflation and changing prices have 
table of contents not had a significant impact on our revenues or loss from operations in the three years ended october  for fiscal  and  these items were as follows in thousands percent of percent of percent of amount total costs amount total costs amount total costs revenues product revenues research and development revenue cost of revenues oxyglobin hemopure total cost of revenues research and development sales and marketing oxyglobin hemopure total sales and marketing general and administrative total costs fiscal years ended october  and our revenues consisted primarily of sales of oxyglobin and funds received from the us army 
revenues from sales of oxyglobin increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal  mostly due to an increase in the sales price of oxyglobin 
in fiscal  we recorded the first sales of hemopure  representing the first sales ever of a hemoglobin based oxygen therapeutic for human use 
revenues from these sales totaled  for the fiscal year 
biopure attributes the low level of sales to the high cost of hemopure compared with allogenic red blood cells rbcs  when available  the fact that allogenic rbcs are considered safe in south africa  and the lack of private medical insurer or governmental reimbursement for the product 
we had anticipated low sales before we began to market  because hemopure marketing is limited to use in surgery 
during fiscal and  we received  and  respectively  from past congressional appropriations administered by the us army to reimburse us for certain trauma development expenses 
we have recorded these funds as revenue in connection with research and development activities supporting the trauma program 
the payments from the army vary relative to the amount of reimbursable activity we are conducting 
cost of revenues includes costs of both oxyglobin and hemopure 
hemopure cost of revenues  which includes the allocation of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs  decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal oxyglobin cost of revenues also decreased in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal these decreases for both hemopure and oxyglobin cost of revenues was primarily due to an impairment charge  in fiscal  of million 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we revised the projected start date of the us navy s proposed resus clinical trial of hemopure due to the fda s clinical hold placed on this proposed trial 
this revision in turn delayed the expected need for expanded production facilities 
as a result  we determined that impairment existed on some manufacturing equipment and recorded a one time  non cash write down of million on this equipment 
there was no comparable impairment charge in fiscal research and development expenses include preclinical studies  clinical trials and clinical trial materials 
in we changed our corporate strategy to focus on developing hemopure for a potential indication in cardiovascular ischemia and on supporting the us navy s government funded efforts to develop a potential 
table of contents out of hospital trauma indication 
prior to that time  our primary focus was on one major project the final phases of hemopure development for its use in patients undergoing surgery 
in addition  during fiscal  we applied in the uk for regulatory approval of a proposed orthopedic surgical anemia indication 
a breakdown of our research and development expenses by major activity is as follows in thousands uk surgical anemia application ischemia program trauma program uk surgical anemia application the uk surgical anemia application expenses relate to the marketing authorization application we submitted to the united kingdom regulatory authority in july the cost of this submission is recorded as a separate project from the historic development that led to the company s bla submission to the fda 
we do not have any revenue projections for this potential indication at this time 
ischemia and trauma programs both the ischemia and the trauma programs are in early stages ie  safety clinical trials and preclinical animal studies although the nmrc is seeking fda authorization to conduct a phase trial in trauma patients 
cumulative ischemia project expenditures of million as of october   consist of the costs of preparing and carrying out pilot clinical trials in europe and south africa 
cumulative trauma expenditures of million as of october   consist of costs primarily associated with preclinical trials  protocol and study design for the proposed nmrc sponsored out of hospital trauma trial 
of these expenses  million has been reimbursed to date by payments administered by the us army 
neither the number of nor the costs of clinical trials that might be necessary for marketing authorization for an ischemia indication or for use in trauma patients can be estimated at this time 
the risks and uncertainties associated with the early stage of planning and execution of the ischemia and trauma clinical development programs include  among other things  uncertainties about results that at any time could require us to abandon or greatly modify either project 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the period in which material net cash inflows for either of these two projects might commence  if ever  and we do not expect to obtain marketing approval of a potential ischemia indication or trauma indication earlier than expenses the increase in research and development in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as shown in the table above  was primarily due to a million increase in salaries expense  expenses related to the filing of a marketing application in july in the united kingdom  for which there were no comparable expenses in  and  in stock based compensation expense recorded under sfas r 
these increases were partially offset by lower spending on trauma and ischemia related preclinical studies 
the  in army reimbursements recorded as revenue during fiscal  as explained above  related to research and development activities and preclinical studies 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal as we continue developing ischemia and trauma indications for hemopure 
hemopure and oxyglobin related sales and marketing expenses increased to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to expenses for a sales agent for hemopure in south africa  which were partially offset by lower salary expenses 
we did not have a sales agent in south africa during fiscal we agreed in late to an early termination of the agreement with the sales agent in south africa 
we plan to hire two sales representatives to market and sell hemopure in south africa rather than seek another third party distributor 
we do not expect these activities or the resulting revenues to have a significant effect on our results of operations for fiscal we expect oxyglobin sales and marketing expenses to be consistent in fiscal with those in fiscal 
table of contents general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to decreases of million in severance expenses   in outside services   in insurance premiums and  in audit and tax related expenses in fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we expensed  relating to a contract termination  and  for restructuring costs associated with vacated office space 
general and administrative cost increases in comprise stock based compensation expense  explained above  and higher legal fees and expenses arising out of the pending derivative litigation described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal years ended october  and our revenues consisted primarily of sales of oxyglobin and funds received from the us army 
to reduce losses  we enacted workforce and other cost reductions in october and in april and june  significantly reduced sales  marketing and manufacturing expenditures  and began limiting oxyglobin sales in april as a result  we had substantially lower oxyglobin sales in fiscal  the first full year following the limitation on oxyglobin sales  than we had in fiscal during fiscal and  we received  and million  respectively  from past congressional appropriations administered by the us army to reimburse us for certain trauma development expenses 
we have recorded these funds as revenue in connection with research and development activities supporting the trauma program 
cost of revenues includes costs of both oxyglobin and hemopure  our product for human use  although hemopure was not offered for sale during fiscal or hemopure cost of revenues  consisting of the allocation of unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs  decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to workforce reductions  lower depreciation expenses  and decreased inventory write downs in fiscal these decreases were partially offset by a million impairment charge 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  we revised the projected start date of the us navy s proposed resus clinical trial of hemopure due to the fda s clinical hold placed on this proposed trial 
this revision in turn delayed the expected need for expanded production facilities 
as a result  we determined that impairment existed on some manufacturing equipment and recorded a one time  non cash write down of million on this equipment 
there was no comparable impairment charge in fiscal oxyglobin cost of revenues decreased primarily due to lower spending and fewer oxyglobin units sold in fiscal as a result of limiting sales 
research and development expenses include preclinical studies  clinical trials and clinical trial materials 
in june  we announced a change in corporate strategy to focus on the development of hemopure for an ischemia indication  while also supporting our collaborative research and development agreement with the nmrc for a potential use in trauma patients 
prior to that time  our primary focus was on one major project hemopure development for use in patients undergoing surgery 
a breakdown of our research and development expenses by major activity is as follows ischemia program trauma program ischemia and trauma programs both the ischemia and the trauma programs are in early stages ie  safety clinical trials and preclinical animal studies 
the costs and dates of completion of additional clinical trials and any further preclinical studies that might be necessary for either an ischemia indication or for use in trauma patients cannot be estimated at this time 
the risks and uncertainties associated with the early stage of planning and execution of the ischemia and trauma clinical development programs include  among other things  uncertainties about results that at any time could require us to abandon or greatly modify either project 
accordingly  we cannot estimate the period in which material net cash inflows for either of these two projects might commence  and we do not expect to obtain marketing approval earlier than 
table of contents expenses the decrease in research and development in fiscal as compared to fiscal  as shown in the table above  was primarily due to lower consulting expenses of million  a million reduction in salaries expense and a  reduction in expenses related to the completion  early in fiscal  of a project associated with the company s fda response activities 
the  in army reimbursements recorded as revenue during fiscal  as explained above  related to research and development activities and preclinical studies 
hemopure and oxyglobin related sales and marketing expenses decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the termination of distribution agreements  the elimination of sales personnel and promotional activities for oxyglobin and the elimination of market research and medical education activities for hemopure 
hemopure expenses for fiscal primarily consisted of ongoing activities in south africa 
general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease was mostly due to reductions of million in legal expenses  million in salaries and other employee related expenses and  in non cash financing fees 
most of the legal costs incurred during fiscal in connection with the united states securities and exchange commission investigation and litigation and the class action litigation were paid by our insurer 
in fiscal  we paid approximately  in uninsured fees and expenses for these proceedings 
these decreases were partially offset by a one time  non cash charge of  related to a contract termination 
they were further partially offset by a  increase in spending on outside services  primarily related to a sarbanes oxley section compliance project 
liquidity and capital resources at october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
since october   we have raised approximately million  before expenses of approximately million  in additional financing see note  to our consolidated financial statements 
we expect this funding  in addition to the cash and cash equivalents at october   to be sufficient to fund operations through august we will continue to explore opportunities to raise capital  through sales of equity securities and  if appropriate  to consider strategic collaborations for sharing development and commercialization costs 
we plan to spend approximately million in fiscal on improvements in our laboratories and manufacturing process at our existing facilities 
cash used in operating activities in fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each year was primarily attributable to our recurring net losses 
cash used in investing activities in fiscal was  attributable to purchases of property and equipment 
in fiscal  financing activities provided us with million in cash 
these cash flows included million from the sale of common stock and warrants and million from the exercise of warrants by investors 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at october  payments due by period less than year years years total in thousands operating leases as explained above  in we entered into a crada with the nmrc 
as part of the crada the navy paid approximately million for future inventory purchases  recorded in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as current portion of deferred revenue and deferred revenue  net of current portion 
if the navy were to decide not to continue to pursue the resus project described in the crada  we could be required to return the million 
as of october   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal and state taxable income through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate realization of such prior losses  no benefit has been recognized in our financial statements as of october  
table of contents recently issued accounting standards in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections sfas 
this statement establishes new standards on accounting for changes in accounting principles 
pursuant to sfas  all such accounting changes must be accounted for by retrospective application to the financial statements of prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas completely replaces apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
 though it carries forward the guidance in those pronouncements with respect to accounting for changes in estimates  changes in the reporting entity and the correction of errors 
this statement shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  beginning with the company s fiscal year 
we do not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on its financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  beginning with our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on its financial statements 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on the sec s views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  beginning with our fiscal year 
the adoption of sab is not expected to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued fas  fair value measurements sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   beginning with our fiscal year although earlier application is encouraged 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on its financial statements  but does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we currently do not have any foreign currency exchange risks  with the exception of negligible exchange fluctuations associated with expenses for clinical trial  regulatory and sales and marketing activities outside of the united states and minimal sales in south africa 
we sell oxyglobin in europe in us dollars 
the customers bear the risk of foreign currency exchange fluctuation 
we sell hemopure in south africa in local currency 
fluctuations in revenues in south africa are offset by fluctuations in our local expenses 
dramatic fluctuations in exchange rates could result in either increases or decreases in unit sales  as the effective unit price to the customer would vary 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in money market funds 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that the interest rate risk exposure is not material
