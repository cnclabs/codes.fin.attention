the recognition of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets and the related tax provision is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our estimates of future earnings based on information currently available 
because of the operating losses we have incurred over the past couple of years and based on projections of taxable income  we established a non cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in we do not expect to record tax expense or benefits on us based operating results until we are consistently profitable on a quarterly basis

critical accounting policies we make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those we consider most critical in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of each of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed each of the disclosures included below 
these policies include significant judgment made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
as described below  however  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
revenue recognition for product related sales  we record revenues when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
when a right of return exists  our practice is to estimate and provide for any future returns at the time of sale  in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
accruals for customer discounts and rebates and defective returns are recorded as the related revenues are recognized 
service revenues include all amounts that are billable to clients under service contracts

the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  under the contractual arrangements with burger king  creative services are a separate deliverable from manufacturing services

allowance for doubtful accounts the allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns represent adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed partially or entirely uncollectible 
management believes the accounting estimate related to such allowances is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in it could materially affect key financial measures including revenues and selling  general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the allowances require a high degree of judgment since they involve the estimation of the impact of both current and future economic factors as it relates to each of our customers ability to pay amounts owed to us 
in the case of our consumer products segment  we must estimate the impact of retail sell through on customer discounts and returns 
we regularly extend credit to distribution companies in connection with our business with the burger king system  which includes supply chain services  llc scs  a subsidiary of burger king s franchisee purchasing cooperative  restaurant services  inc rsi 
we began selling product to scs in october because of scs s established credit history with us  we do not believe that the concentration of receivables has a negative impact to our overall credit risk 
failure by scs or one or more distribution companies to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
rsi and  beginning in october  scs  accounted for  and of the products purchased from us by the burger king system for the years ended december   and  respectively 
scs accounted for and of accounts receivable as of december  and  respectively 
we also extend credit to several retailers in the consumer products business 
the mass market retail channel has experienced significant shifts in market share among competitors in recent years  causing some large retailers to experience liquidity problems 
failure by one or more of these retailers to honor their payment obligations to us could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we have procedures to mitigate the risk of exposure to losses from bad debts 
revenue is recognized provided that there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  persuasive evidence of an agreement exists documenting the specific terms of the transaction  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our credit limits and payment terms are established based on the underlying criteria that collectibility must be reasonably assured at the levels set for each customer 
extensive evaluations are performed on an on going basis throughout the fiscal year of the financial performance  cash generation  financing availability and liquidity status of each customer 
each customer is reviewed at least annually  with more frequent reviews being performed if necessary based on the customer s financial condition and the level of credit being extended 
for customers who are experiencing financial difficulties  management performs additional financial analyses prior to shipping to those customers on credit 
customer terms and credit limits are reviewed and adjusted  if necessary  to reflect the results of the review 
we use a variety of financial transactions to ensure collectibility of accounts receivable of customers deemed to be a credit risk  including requiring letters of credit and requiring cash on delivery 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns at the time revenue is recognized based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical collection experience  accounts receivable aging  retail sell through and customer disputes 
when a significant event occurs  such as a bankruptcy filing of a customer  the allowance is reviewed for adequacy and adjusted to reflect the change in estimated receivable impairment 
we believe that our allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns at december  are adequate 
goodwill and other intangibles under the provisions of sfas no 
 the carrying value of assets acquired  including goodwill  are reviewed annually 
during such a review we estimate the fair value of the reporting unit to which the assets were assigned by discounting the reporting unit s estimated future cash flows before interest 
we compare the discounted future cash flows to the carrying value of the acquired net assets to determine if an impairment loss has occurred 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their estimated fair values 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
and determined that the goodwill resulting from the acquisitions of logistix uk and sci promotion was impaired as of december  as a result  we recorded a non cash charge in the amount of  and  to write down the carrying value of the logistix uk and sci promotion goodwill  respectively 
in addition  we recorded a non cash charge of  relating to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets of johnson grossfield as a result of the loss of its most significant client 
in  we recorded a non cash charge in the amount of  to write down the carrying value of the upshot goodwill 
management believes the accounting estimate related to the valuation of its goodwill and other intangibles is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in assumptions could materially affect key financial measures  including net income and goodwill 
our valuation method requires us to make projections of revenue  operating expenses and working capital investment for each reporting unit over a multi year period 
additionally  management must make an estimate of its weighted average cost of capital to be used as a discount rate 
changes in these projections or estimates could result in a reporting unit either passing or failing the first step in the sfas no 
impairment model  which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded 
royalties we enter into agreements to license intellectual properties such as trademarks  copyrights and patents 
the agreements may call for minimum amounts of royalties to be paid in advance and throughout the term of the agreement  which are non refundable in the event that product sales fail to meet certain minimum levels 
advance royalties resulting from such transactions are stated at the lower of the amounts paid or the amounts estimated to be recoverable from future sales of the related products 
furthermore  minimum guaranteed royalty commitments are reviewed on a periodic basis to ensure that amounts are recoverable based on estimates of future sales of the products under license 
a loss provision will be recorded in the consolidated statements of operations to the extent that future minimum royalty guarantee commitments are not recoverable 
estimated future sales are projected based on historical experience  including that of similar products  and anticipated advertising and marketing support by the licensor 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pre tax charge of  relating to minimum royalty guarantee shortfalls on several consumer products licenses 
these shortfalls are the result of our decision to wind down its consumer products business  pop rocket which resulted in a decrease in expectations of future sales under several licenses 
on may   we reached a settlement with one of our licensors affecting several licenses 
under the terms of the settlement  we agreed to forgo its rights to certain licensed properties for and in exchange for a reduction in the overall royalty guarantees 
we retained product distribution rights under the licenses for as a result of this settlement  our overall commitment for royalty guarantees was reduced by approximately  we were required to pay the licensor a total of  through march  as a result of this settlement and higher than expected scooby doo revenues that exceeded our initial estimates   of the charge for minimum royalty guarantee shortfalls was reversed in in  the company reached a settlement with a different licensor which resulted in a reversal of the reversals were recorded as a minimum royalty guarantee shortfall gain in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and management believes the accounting estimate related to minimum guaranteed royalty commitments is a critical accounting estimate because changes in sales projections could materially affect key financial measures including  gross profit  net income and other assets 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory obsolescence reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management believes the accounting estimate related to inventory allowance is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it could materially affect key financial measures including  gross profit  net income and inventories 
in addition  the valuation requires a high degree of judgment since it involves estimation of the impact resulting from both current and expected future events 
as more fully described below  valuation of our consumer product inventory could be impacted by changes in public and consumer preferences  demand for product  or changes in the buying patterns and inventory management of customers 
although the significant majority of our inventories are composed of made to order promotional product  in the consumer products segment orders are subject to cancellation or change at any time prior to shipment since actual shipments of products ordered and order cancellation rates are affected by consumer acceptance of product lines  strength of competing products  marketing strategies of retailers and overall economic conditions 
unexpected changes in these factors could result in excess inventory in a particular product line  which would require management to make a valuation estimate on such inventory 
we base our production schedules for consumer products on customer orders  historical trends  results of market research and current market information 
we ship products in accordance with delivery schedules specified by our customers  which usually request delivery within three months 
in anticipation of retail sales in the traditional holiday season in the fourth quarter  we significantly increase our production in advance of the peak selling period  resulting in a corresponding build up of consumer product inventory levels in the second and third quarters of the year 
these seasonal purchasing patterns and requisite production lead times cause risk to our consumer products business associated with the underproduction of popular products and the overproduction of products that do not have significant consumer demand 
retailers are also attempting to manage their inventories more tightly  requiring us to ship products closer to the time the retailers expect to sell the products to consumers 
these factors increase inventory valuation risk since we may not be able to meet demand for certain products at peak demand times  or that our own inventory levels may be adversely impacted by the need to pre build products before orders are placed 
additionally  current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth in various parts of the economy  including the markets in which we participate 
economic changes may affect the sales of our consumer products and its corresponding inventory levels  which would potentially impact the valuation of our inventory 
at the end of each quarter  management within the consumer products business segment performs a detailed review of its inventory on an item by item basis and identifies which products are believed to be obsolete or slow moving 
management then applies an allowance for inventory obsolescence to such inventory based on certain expectations  including customer and consumer demand for product and the aging of the inventory  which are impacted by the factors discussed above 
management believes that the allowance for inventory obsolescence at december  is adequate and proper 
however  the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary 
any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect the results of operations of the consumer products business segment 
the following table summarizes our obsolescence reserve at december allowance for obsolescence as a percentage of total inventories the decrease from to in the allowance for obsolescence was mainly due to the specific identification of excess inventory that was impaired as of year end management believes that its allowance for obsolescence at year end is adequate and proper 
however  the impact resulting from the aforementioned factors could cause actual results to vary 
any incremental obsolescence charges would negatively affect our results of operations 
income taxes our income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual and expected future income  us and foreign statutory income tax rates  and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to income taxes is a critical accounting estimate because significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the us and in foreign jurisdictions  determining our worldwide tax positions  and assessing the likelihood of realizing certain tax benefits 
actual results could differ materially from those judgments  and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
certain income and expense items are accounted for differently for financial reporting and income tax purposes 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated statements of operations is different than that reported in our tax returns filed with the taxing authorities 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expense 
these timing differences create deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
deferred income tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded a tax benefit in its consolidated statement of operations 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred income tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  management believes expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of a deduction or credit in that jurisdiction 
we evaluate the level of our valuation allowances at least annually  and more frequently if actual operating results differ significantly from forecasted results 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires us to analyze all positive and negative evidence to determine if  based on the weight of available evidence  we are more likely than not to realize the benefit of our net deferred tax assets 
the recognition of a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets and the related tax provision is based upon our conclusions regarding  among other considerations  our estimates of future earnings based on information currently available 
because of the operating losses we incurred in and  and based on projections of taxable income  we established a non cash valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in we do not expect to record tax expense or benefits on us based operating results until we are consistently profitable on a quarterly basis 
at that time  the valuation allowance will be reassessed and could be eliminated  resulting in the recognition of the deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance provided against deferred tax assets is  and  at december  and  respectively 
we recorded a tax provision of  in as the result of establishing a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of see disclosure in note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
in  we recorded a net benefit for income taxes of as the result of more favorable state income tax apportionment factors than originally anticipated in our previous tax provision estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of interest rate changes the amounts borrowed under our bank of america credit facility are at variable interest rates  and we are subject to market risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   we had no amount outstanding under our facility 
as of december   the marginal interest rate on available borrowings under our credit facility was 
impact of foreign currency fluctuation approximately of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies  and we are subject to market risks resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in certain instances  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts in order to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the value of our firm commitments and certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
we currently intend to continue to enter into such contracts to hedge against future material foreign currency exchange rate risks 
as of december   our logistix uk subsidiary entered into foreign currency forward contracts aggregating  gbp to sell euros in exchange for gbp and usd  and to sell gbp in exchange for us dollars 
the contracts will expire by april at december   these foreign currency forward contracts had an estimated fair value of gbp us dollars 
these foreign currency forward contracts are designated as a cash flow hedge of inventory purchases from vendors and cash receipts from customers related to promotional products programs 
the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts is recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  the unrealized loss on the contracts is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income
