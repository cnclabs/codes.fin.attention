item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set out in part i general information  item a risk factors elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report 
overview our business we are a leading provider of video game accessories and software primarily marketed under the mad catz and gameshark brands  we also produce for selected customers a limited range of products which are marketed on a private label basis 
we design  manufacture primarily through third parties in asia  market and distribute accessories for all major video game platforms  including the microsoft xbox and xbox  nintendo wii  gamecube  ds lite  ds  game boy advance sp  game boy advance  and micro  sony playstation  playstation  playstation and psp 
our products include video game accessories  such as control pads  steering wheels  joysticks  memory cards  video cables  light guns  dance pads  microphones  car adapters and carry cases 
we also market video game enhancement software and publish video games 
seasonality and fluctuation of sales we generate a substantial percentage of our net sales in the last three months of every calendar year  our fiscal third quarter 
our quarterly results of operations can be expected to fluctuate significantly in the future  as a result of many factors  including seasonal influences on our sales  unpredictable consumer preferences and spending trends  the introduction of new video game platforms  the need to increase inventories in advance of our primary selling season  and timing of introductions of new products 
see further discussion and sales by quarter under net sales below 
transition to next generation consoles our industry is cyclical and we believe it is still transitioning into the next cycle  which began with the release of microsoft s xbox in november and continued with the north american releases of sony s playstation and nintendo s wii at the end of in fiscal  we launched a range of accessories compatible with the xbox  playstation and wii video game consoles as well as continued to provide accessories to the significant installed base of current consoles in the marketplace 
to date  our ability to release certain products on the new video game consoles has been restricted by technological requirements 
foreign currency approximately of our annual sales are transacted outside the united states 
the majority of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the us dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
in fiscal and fiscal  we did not hedge against foreign currency exposure and we cannot predict the effect foreign currency fluctuations will have on us during fiscal critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires 
table of contents management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from the sale of our products  including interactive software licensed from third party developers 
we recognize revenue based on the applicable provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and on the criteria set forth in statement of position  software revenue recognition 
accordingly  we recognize revenue when each of the following have occurred there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement with our customer exists  which is generally a customer purchase order  the products are delivered  which generally occurs when the products are shipped and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of the customer receivable is deemed probable 
our payment arrangements with customers typically provide net and day terms 
revenues from sales to authorized resellers are subject to terms allowing price protection  certain rights of return and allowances for customer marketing programs 
reserves for price protection are recorded when the price protection program is offered to the customer 
allowances for estimated future returns and customer marketing programs are provided for upon revenue recognition 
such amounts are estimated and periodically adjusted based on historical and anticipated rates of returns  inventory levels and other factors and are recorded as either a reduction of revenue or operating expense in accordance with eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
customer marketing programs we record allowances for customer marketing programs  including certain rights of return  price protection  volume based cash incentives and cooperative advertising 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued as either a reduction to revenue or as an operating expense in the period we have sold the product or committed to the program 
significant management judgments and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
we grant limited rights of return for certain products 
estimates of expected future product returns are based on analyses of historical returns and information regarding inventory levels and the demand and acceptance of our products by the end consumer 
consistent with industry standards and practices  on a product by product basis by customer  we allow price protection credits to be issued to retailers in the event of a subsequent price reduction 
in general  price protection refers to the circumstances when we elect to decrease the price of a product as a result of reduction in competitive prices and issue credits to our customers to protect the customers from lower profit margins on their then current inventory of the product 
the decision to effect price reductions is influenced by retailer inventory levels  product lifecycle stage  market acceptance  competitive environment and new product introductions 
credits are issued based upon the number of units that customers have on hand at the date of the price reduction 
upon our offer of a price protection program  reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established 
reserves are recorded based on analyses of qualified inventories on hand with retailers and distributors 
we enter into cooperative advertising arrangements with many of our customers allowing customers to receive a credit for various advertising programs 
the amounts of the credits are based on specific dollar value programs or a percentage of sales  depending on the terms of the program negotiated with the individual 
table of contents customer 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these advertising programs are recorded based on the specific negotiations with individual customers in the period in which the revenue is recognized 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of these cooperative advertising program accruals 
we also offer volume rebates to several of our customers and record reserves for such rebates as a reduction of revenue at the time revenue is recognized 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on programs negotiated with the specific customers 
future market conditions and product transitions may require us to take action to increase customer programs and incentive offerings that could result in incremental reductions to revenue or increased operating expenses at the time the incentive is offered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products in the united states and internationally primarily through retailers 
we generally do not require any collateral from our customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and by purchasing credit insurance on european accounts receivable balances 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which we believe is adequate 
the allowance is based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as historical experience with bad debts  receivables aging and current economic trends 
our customer base is highly concentrated and a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition  or a decline in the general economic conditions could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
as of march   one customer represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivables as of march  if any of these customer s receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have an adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations in the period the adjustments are made 
inventory reserves we value inventories at the lower of cost or market value 
if the estimated market value is determined to be less than the recorded cost of the inventory  a provision is made to reduce the carrying amount of the inventory item 
determination of the market value may be complex  and therefore  requires management to make assumptions and to apply a high degree of judgment 
in order for management to make the appropriate determination of market value  the following items are commonly considered inventory turnover statistics  inventory quantities on hand in our facilities and customer inventories  unfilled customer order quantities  forecasted consumer demand  current retail prices  competitive pricing  seasonality factors  consumer trends  and performance of similar products or accessories 
subsequent changes in facts or circumstances do not result in the reversal of previously recorded reserves 
we have not made any significant changes in the methodology or assumptions used to establish our inventory reserves as reported during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a significant change in the future methodology or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory reserves 
however  if our estimates regarding market value are inaccurate  or changes in consumer demand affect specific products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to additional increases in our inventory reserves that could be material 

table of contents software development costs software development costs primarily consist of payments made to independent software developers under development agreements 
we account for software development costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  which provides for the capitalization of certain software development costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software is established or for development costs that have alternative future uses 
under our current practice of developing new products  the technological feasibility of the underlying software is not established until substantially all product development is complete and the first playable version is delivered 
the software development costs that have been capitalized to date have been insignificant 
royalties and intellectual property licenses royalty and license expenses consist of royalties and license fees paid to intellectual property rights holders for use of their trademarks  copyrights  software  technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights in the development or sale of our products 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our video game titles 
royalty based payments that are paid in advance are generally capitalized and expensed to cost of sales at the greater of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
with regard to payments made to independent software developers and co publishing affiliates  the company is generally subject to development risk prior to the general release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of the product are generally expensed as research and development as the services are incurred 
payments due after the general release of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of sales at the higher of the contractual or effective royalty rate based on net product sales 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we perform an annual impairment review at the reporting unit level during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment are present 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets be assessed for impairment using fair value measurement techniques 
specifically  goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we performed step one of the annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal years  and and determined that the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded its net book value 
therefore  step two was not required
