item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking statements due to various factors  including  but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
management does not believe that inflation or changing prices has had a material effect on our revenues and income from continuing operations 
overview we provide software and related services that allow our clients to more effectively manage their contract based  business to business relationships through the entirety of the contract management lifecycle 
we operate our business in two segments health and life sciences and industry solutions 
the health and life sciences line of business markets and sells our products and services to companies in the life sciences industries  including pharmaceutical and medical product companies  wholesale distributors and managed care organizations 
the industry solutions line of business targets all other industries  with an emphasis on consumer products  foodservice  disposables  oil gas energy  consumer durables  industrial products  chemicals  apparel  and telecommunications 
our primary products and services were originally developed to manage complex contract purchasing relationships in the healthcare industry 
our software is currently licensed by of the largest world wide 
table of contents pharmaceutical manufacturers  ranked according to annual pharma revenues 
as the depth and breadth of our product suites have expanded  we have added companies in the industry solutions markets to our customer base 
we have generated revenues from both products and services 
product revenues  comprised of fees generated from licenses of our contract life cycle management software suites  accounted for of net revenues in versus of net revenues in service revenues include maintenance and support fees directly related to our licensed software products  professional service fees derived from consulting  installation  business analysis and training services related to our software products and hosting fees 
service revenues accounted for of net revenues in versus of net revenues in we implemented a number of employee headcount reductions and office downsizings during the period june through march  after which our aggregate quarterly spending on cost of products and services  sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses excluding amortization and noncash stock compensation remained fairly steady ranging from million to million through the first quarter of in early  we increased our spending  primarily on research and development and professional services  in order to i accelerate development of future releases of our product offerings in the health and life sciences segment  ii work on resolving defects in one of our software products  as explained in further detail in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item  and iii augment staff levels at a number of professional services engagements  primarily in connection with implementations of the software product with performance defects at customer sites 
we expect that our spending on research and development will continue at high levels relative to our revenues for much of our total employee headcount has increased from at march  and at december  to at december  on march   the shareholders of the company voted to reject a proposed merger among the company  selectica  inc and a subsidiary of selectica 
as a result  the merger agreement among the parties terminated 
under the terms of the merger agreement  selectica would have paid per share in cash for all outstanding shares of our common stock  for a total transaction value of approximately million 
in august  the company announced the departure of its chief executive officer  a 
leigh powell  and its chief operating officer  terrence m 
nicholson 
in connection with the resignation of these executives  we incurred  in future severance and benefit costs in also  yorgen edholm was appointed acting president and chief executive officer  and john a 
rade was appointed chairman of the board of directors with certain executive powers 
in february  mr 
edholm resigned as acting president and chief executive officer while remaining on the board of directors  and mr 
rade assumed the position of acting president and chief executive officer on an interim basis 
in august  mr 
rade was appointed president and chief executive officer on a permanent basis 
on november   we completed a private placement of our securities  issuing  shares of our common stock and common stock purchase warrants to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock 
the per unit price of the private placement offering was  with each unit comprised of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase three tenths of a share of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable at per share until november net proceeds to the company were approximately million  after deducting commissions and other fees 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition we generate revenues from licensing our software and providing professional services  training and maintenance and support services 
software license revenues are attributable to the addition of new customers and the expansion or renewal of existing customer relationships through licenses covering additional users  licenses of additional software products and license renewals 

table of contents we recognize software license fees upon execution of a signed license agreement and delivery of the software to customers  provided there are no significant post delivery obligations  the payment is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
in multiple element arrangements  we allocate a portion of the total fee to professional services  training and maintenance and support services based on the fair value of those elements  which is defined as the price charged when those elements are sold separately 
the residual amount is then allocated to the software license fee 
in cases where we agree to deliver unspecified additional products in the future  the license fee is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement beginning with the delivery of the first product 
in cases where we agree to deliver specified additional products or upgrades in the future  recognition of the entire license fee  including any related maintenance and support fees  is deferred until after the specified additional products or upgrades are delivered and made generally available to all customers 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are deferred until customer acceptance 
in cases where collection is not deemed probable  we recognize the license fee as payments are received 
in cases where significant production or customization is required prior to attaining technological feasibility of the software  license fees are recognized on a percentage of completion basis and are credited to research and development expenses as a funded development arrangement 
after the software attains technological feasibility  recognizable license fees are reported as product revenue 
service revenues include professional services  training and maintenance and support services and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
professional service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
if conditions for acceptance exist  professional service revenues are recognized upon customer acceptance 
for fixed fee professional service contracts  we provide for anticipated losses in the period in which the loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
training revenues are recognized as the services are provided 
included in training revenues are registration fees received from participants in our off site user training conferences 
maintenance and customer support fees are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  which is generally twelve months 
when maintenance and support is included in the total license fee  we allocate a portion of the total fee to maintenance and support based upon the price paid by the customer when sold separately  generally as renewals in the second year 
payments received from customers at the inception of a maintenance period are treated as deferred service revenues and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
payments received from customers in advance of product shipment or revenue recognition are treated as deferred product revenues and recognized when the product is shipped to the customer or when otherwise earned 
we offer current and prospective customers the option to enter into a subscription agreement as an alternative to our standard license contract model 
management believes its subscription offering has expanded the market to customers that find regular subscription payments an easier and more flexible implementation of our software  and subscription arrangements have the potential to provide us with smoother and more predictable revenue growth 
the standard subscription arrangement is presently a fixed fee agreement over three to five years  covering license fees  unspecified new product releases and maintenance and support  generally payable in equal quarterly installments commencing upon execution of the agreement 
in most agreements that have been executed to date  the subscription arrangement converts free of charge to a perpetual license after the completion of the initial term plus any extensions  generally after five years  after which time the customer would have the option of paying for the continuation of maintenance and support 
we recognize all revenue from subscription based arrangements ratably over the term of the subscription agreement commencing upon delivery of the initial product 
subscription installment amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers are not reflected in deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of the periodic subscription fee revenue  generally to percent  is allocated to service revenue based on the relationship of our standard annual maintenance and support renewal rates to the related perpetual license fees  with the balance of the subscription fee revenue classified as product revenue in our financial statements 

table of contents subscription arrangements  including perpetual license arrangements with rights to unspecified additional products that are treated as subscriptions for accounting purposes  now represent a significant proportion of our new licenses 
in  of the license deals minimum value of  that were sold are being treated as subscription arrangements for accounting purposes 
during and  we recognized million and  respectively  in product revenue related to such agreements 
see the reconciliation table that follows under results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues in this item for  we anticipate that subscription revenues will continue to increase and that such arrangements will represent a significant proportion of new license sales 
during the third quarter of  we became aware of certain defects in the then current version of one of our software products  which was first shipped to customers in the fourth quarter of these defects  which were not identified in pre release product testing  affected the performance of the software for a portion of our customers depending on each customer s particular implementation environment and its intended use of the software 
because certain concessions have been made to customers in connection with these defects  we have generally not recognized revenue from sales of this software product and related implementation services beginning in the third quarter of  except in those cases in which it was determined that the customer was not likely to be affected by the known  unresolved software defects 
during  new versions of the software were released  but we continued to experience problems with implementations at several customer sites 
in the first quarter of  we plan to complete development of a major new release of the software which has been designed to resolve known performance defects 
we intend to continue deferring revenue in connection with license sales  maintenance and support  and implementation services for this software product until it has been demonstrated at multiple customer sites that the new release of the software is free of significant performance defects 
as of december  and  we have reversed and deferred cumulative amounts of million and million  respectively  of otherwise recognizable product and service revenue  based in part on our estimate of the fair value of concessions to be made until the remaining defect is resolved  and partly on our determination that license fees were not fixed and determinable because of the possibility of future concessions 
also  see risk factor entitled we cannot guarantee that our deferred revenue will be recognized as planned in item a of this filing 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
revised fas r  share based payment 
under fas r  we measure and record the compensation cost of employee and director services received in exchange for stock option grants and other equity awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards 
the values of the portions of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest are recognized as expense over the requisite service periods 
we account for stock options and awards granted to non employees other than directors using the fair value method 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  pursuant to which our financial statement for prior reporting periods have not been adjusted to include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method 
prior to  we used the intrinsic value method to measure compensation expense associated with the grants of stock options or awards to employees and directors 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation associated with such grants and awards was determined as the excess  if any  of the current fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant over the price an employee or director must pay to exercise the award 
under the fair value method  compensation associated with equity awards is determined based on the estimated fair value of the award itself  measured using either current market data or an established option pricing model 
the measurement date for employee and director awards is generally the date of grant 
the measurement date for awards granted to non employees other than directors is generally the date that performance of certain services is complete 

table of contents the company s calculations of the fair value of stock option grant  including valuations for pre pro forma calculations  were made using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions  and resulted in the following weighted average grant date fair values of options granted during the years ended december risk free interest rates expected volatility expected dividends expected term in years weighted average grant date fair value of options granted during the year the company uses historical volatility of the company s common stock to estimate expected volatility 
beginning in  the expected term of options granted is estimated to be equal to the average of the contractual life of the options and the grant s average vesting period 
the risk free interest rate is derived quarterly from the published us treasury yield curve  based on expected term  in effect as of the last several days of the quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts we record provisions for doubtful accounts based on a detailed assessment of our accounts receivable and related credit risks 
in estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers the age of the accounts receivables  our historical write off experience  the credit worthiness of customers and the economic conditions of the customers industries and general economic conditions  among other factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
if the assumptions we used to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future collections  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
the provisions for doubtful accounts are included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
acquired intangible assets acquired intangible assets excluding goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or on an interim basis if an event or circumstance occurs between annual tests indicating that the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test will consist of comparing the cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at the reportable segment level using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any  by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets  with the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances 
table of contents change that would likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
if the assumptions we used to estimate fair value of goodwill change  there could be an impact on future reported results of operations 
deferred tax assets a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for temporary differences in the bases of assets and liabilities for book and tax purposes and loss carry forwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when these temporary items are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to the extent it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
product indemnification our agreements with customers generally include certain provisions obligating us to indemnify the customer against losses  expenses  and liabilities from damages that may be awarded against the customer in the event that our products are found to infringe upon a patent  copyright  trademark  or other proprietary right of a third party 
the agreements generally seek to limit the scope of remedies for such indemnification obligations in a variety of industry standard respects  including our right to replace an infringing product 
to date  we have not had to reimburse any of our customers for any losses related to these indemnification provisions and no claims were outstanding as of december  we do not expect that any significant impact on financial position or the results of operations will result from these indemnification provisions 
research and development costs research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
based on our product development process  technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs incurred by the company between completion of the working model and the point at which the product is ready for general release have not been material 
as such  all software development costs incurred to date have been expensed as incurred 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  product revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from the prior year  while service revenues decreased by  or  to million 
as indicated in the table below  the gross value of license contracts sold during increased by versus  due primarily to an increase in the average selling price as the number of license transactions minimum value of  decreased from to however  most of the revenue from the license transactions executed in is being deferred to future reporting periods because of the license deals executed in were either accounted for as subscription arrangements or have conditions  for example  software acceptance testing  which result in deferral of license revenue recognition 
we believe that a significant proportion of future license contracts will likewise be subscription arrangements or will have conditions which mandate deferred revenue recognition 
as a result  in future reporting periods we expect recognized revenues to exclude much of the license revenue generated from contracts entered into in those periods but also to include larger proportions of revenues from contracts entered into in prior reporting periods 
reconciliation of value of license transactions to reportable product revenue three months ended december  twelve months ended december  amounts in thousands gross value of license contracts sold health and life sciences industry solutions add product revenue recorded in current period from contracts sold in prior periods health and life sciences subscriptions health and life sciences other deferrals industry solutions subscriptions less value of license contracts sold in current period and not currently recognizable health and life sciences industry solutions product revenue recorded health and life sciences industry solutions the above financial information is provided as additional information and is not in accordance with or an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
we believe its inclusion can enhance an overall understanding of our past operational performance and also our prospects for the future 
this reconciliation of product revenues is made with the intent of providing a more complete understanding of our sales performance  as opposed to gaap revenue results  which do not include the impact of newly executed subscription agreements and other deferred revenue arrangements that are material to the ongoing performance of our business 
this information quantifies the various components comprising current revenue  which in each 
table of contents period consists of the total value of licenses sold in current periods  plus product revenue recorded in the current period from contracts sold in prior periods  less the value of license contracts sold in the current period that is not yet recognizable 
included in the gross value of license contracts sold amounts are license and non cancelable subscription fee obligations that are not currently recognizable as product revenue upon execution of the license agreement because all the requirements for revenue recognition see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item are not present  such as the presence of extended payment terms  future software deliverables  or customer acceptance provisions 
the gross value of license contracts sold also includes amounts that are not yet contractually billable to customers and any such unbilled amounts are not reflected in deferred revenues on our consolidated balance sheet 
management uses this information as a basis for planning and forecasting core business activity in future periods and believes it is useful in understanding our results of operations 
also  payouts under our sales compensation plans and certain components of our executive bonus plans are largely derived from the gross values of license contracts sold instead of from reported gaap revenues 
the presentation of this additional revenue information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for revenues reported in accordance with gaap in the united states 
there can be no assurance that the full value of licenses sold and deferred to future reporting periods will ultimately be recognized as revenues 
total net revenues derived from the health and life sciences segment decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
the decrease was comprised principally of decreases in this segment s product revenues and professional services revenues of million  or  and million  or  respectively  partially offset by an increase of  or  in segment maintenance and support revenues 
the decrease in product revenue notwithstanding  the gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during increased by  or  relative to the year earlier period  due to a increase in the average selling price partially offset by a decrease in the number of license transactions 
as indicated above  subscription arrangements and other agreements with deferral conditions constituted a significant proportion of our new license arrangements in  and thus much of revenue generated from the new licenses was deferred to future periods 
total net revenues derived from the industry solutions segment decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december  from the prior period 
segment product revenues decreased by  or  to  in from  in  while segment service revenues increased by  or  to million in from million in  the service revenue increase being attributable to a significant increase in hosting revenues 
the decrease in product revenues was largely attributable to nearly all product revenues in connection with license transactions in this segment having been deferred to future periods because all significant agreements were structured as subscription arrangements or included contractual acceptance clauses 
also  the total gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during decreased by  or  versus due to decreases in both the number of license transactions and the average selling price 
licensing activity in the industry solutions segment was negatively affected by product defect issues in one of our key software products see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item above and this negative impact should continue until the software defects are resolved  which management anticipates will occur during the first half of overall service revenues decreased by  or to million in the year ended december  versus million in this decrease was attributable to a million  or  decrease in professional services revenues in our health and life sciences segment  caused by reduced demand for consulting services in connection with large scale implementation projects  partially offset by increases of i  or  in hosting revenues across both segments and ii  or  in maintenance and support revenues in our life sciences segment  which was attributable to continued growth in our maintenance paying  installed customer base in that segment 
operating expenses cost of third party technology 
cost of third party technology  which consists of amounts due to third parties for royalties related to integrated technology  has not been significant historically 
cost of third 
table of contents party technology decreased by  or  to  for the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to the change in the mix of license transactions  with fewer transactions with high content of third party technology being executed in the current year relative to the year earlier period 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of payroll and related costs and subcontractor costs for providing professional services and maintenance and support services 
cost of services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases of i million in the cost of consultants  resulting from the need to augment our professional services staff on certain implementation engagements  ii  in data center hosting fees  reflecting the increase in demand for hosting services discussed above  and iii  in noncash stock compensation costs  resulting from our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised fas r 
as noted in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item  one of our software products has been experiencing performance defects  and consequently we have increased outsourced staffing on certain implementation engagements without a corresponding increase in revenue 
largely as a consequence of this increase in nonbillable implementation services  cost of services increased significantly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a percentage of service revenues 
amortization of other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our acquisitions amounted to  in the year ended december   which represents a  or  decrease in amortization from the year earlier period 
this decrease is attributable to the intangible assets in connection with the acquisitions of netreturn  llc and menerva technologies  inc becoming fully amortized during the first quarter of sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefits for sales and marketing personnel  commissions for sales personnel  travel costs  recruiting fees  expenses for trade shows and advertising and public relations expenses 
sales and marketing expense increased by  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to increases of i  in marketing related consulting fees  ii  in noncash stock compensation costs  resulting from our adoption of fas r  and iii  in commission costs  resulting primarily from draw payments instituted as part of a sales staff retention plan 
as a percentage of total net revenues  sales and marketing expense increased to in versus in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and related costs for development personnel and external consulting costs associated with the development and maintenance of our products 
research and development costs  including the costs of developing computer software  are charged to operations as they are incurred 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was principally comprised of increases of i million in consulting costs  ii  in salary and related costs  resulting from an increase in average headcount of employees  and iii  in noncash stock compensation costs  resulting from our adoption of fas r  partially offset by  in funded development credits 
the increase in consulting and salary related costs is largely attributable to our efforts to resolve product defect issues in one of our key software products see critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item above and is also the result of our ramping up resources for the development of next generation products for our health and life sciences segment 
consequently  research and development expense increased significantly to in versus in as a percentage of total net revenues 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in our administrative  finance  legal and human resources departments  insurance 
table of contents costs  and legal  accounting and other professional service fees

as a percentage of total net revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  depreciation 
depreciation expense increased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this increase is principally attributable to an increase in the level of furniture  equipment and software additions to  in as compared to annual average additions of  for the years through restructuring and other charges 
in the year ended december   we recorded  in charges related to efforts in prior quarters to streamline operations 
this charge represents the amortization of the discount incorporated in the initial restructuring provisions for future lease costs in connection with the chicago and london office downsizings  which occurred in in the year ended december   we recorded  in credits related to efforts in prior years to streamline operations 
other income  net other income  net  increased by  or  to  in the year ended december  relative to  in this increase was principally comprised of a  increase in interest income  attributable to significantly higher average yields  and a  decrease in foreign currency transaction losses 
income taxes we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards

see discussion following the reconciliation table in results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues in this item total net revenues derived from the industry solutions segment decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  nearly all of this decrease is attributable to a reduction in license revenue as service revenues in this segment decreased by only  or  relative to as indicated in the above table  the gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during decreased by  or  relative to we believe this decrease in license sales was primarily attributable to a significant drop off in sales execution in the fourth quarter of relative to the three prior quarters of and did not indicate a market trend 
in  we also deferred license and service revenues from certain customers with especially complex implementations of these new products 

table of contents total net revenues derived from the health and life sciences segment decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million in the prior year 
decreases in this segment s product revenues and professional services revenues of million and million  respectively  were partially offset by a  increase in maintenance and support revenues 
as indicated in the table above  the gross value of license contracts sold in this segment during increased by million  or  relative to  although this increase was not reflected in revenues because of the deferral of much of the current year s transactions license revenue to future periods

depreciation expense decreased by  or  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  this decrease was principally attributable to a significant drop off in the level of furniture  equipment and software additions from the years million and  to the years  and  the majority of these asset additions being depreciated over a three year life 
restructuring and other charges 
in the year ended december   we recorded  in credits related to efforts in prior years to streamline operations 
these credits resulted from reductions in the provisions for future lease costs for the chicago and london offices 
during the year ended december   in connection with the reduction of our leased space in london  england and the significant reduction in our portland  maine operation  as part of our efforts to reduce operating expenses and consolidate operations  we wrote off  in future lease obligations and recognized  in equipment impairment charges

we have not  in the past  hedged against risks related to foreign currency changes  and do not currently do so 
income taxes in  we recorded an  benefit arising from a refund related to the carry back of an operating loss to a pre acquisition fiscal period for our subsidiary based in the united kingdom 
other than this carry back benefit  we incurred operating losses for all quarters in and and have consequently recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset  which consists principally of our net operating loss carryforwards 
no provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources on november   we completed a private placement of our common stock and warrants  which resulted in our receipt of approximately million in net proceeds

net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted principally of our net loss of million as reduced by non cash items depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million  partially offset by increases in deferred revenue and accounts payable of million and million  respectively  and a million decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in deferred revenue is mostly attributable to i a million increase in license fee and services deferrals  resulting from increased prevalence of contractual customer acceptance clauses in license agreements and to the software performance related deferrals noted in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in this item  ii a  increase in deferred subscription fees  which is a result of the increased popularity of subscription license arrangements  and iii a  increase in deferred maintenance and support revenue  which is largely attributable to delayed recognition of maintenance and support renewals for customers with certain rights to future versions of our products 
the increase in accounts payable was largely the result of the timing of payments  the balance at december  being unusually high relative to prior quarters 
the decrease in accounts receivable was principally attributable to a million decrease in the value of non subscription license agreements executed during the quarter ended december  versus the quarter ended december  for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities consisted principally of i the net loss of million  as offset by non cash items depreciation and amortization of million and noncash stock based compensation of  ii a decrease in accounts payable of  and iii an increase in prepaid expenses of  partially offset by a million increase in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts payable was largely the result of the timing of payments  the balance at december  being unusually high relative to prior and subsequent quarters 
the increase in prepaid expenses was primarily attributable to  in advance royalty payments to third party software developers during  a portion of which has since been amortized into expense 
the million increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to the net increase in the cumulative value of deferred license transactions  as documented in the table entitled reconciliation of value of license transactions to reportable product revenue included in the discussion of net revenues in this item net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  consisted principally of  in purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  consisted of million in net redemptions of short term investments and available for sale securities  partially offset by  in property and equipment additions and  in merger consideration paid in connection with the pricing analytics acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in the year ended december   principally comprised of million in net proceeds from a private placement sale of common stock and  in proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises  as compared to million in the year ended december   which consisted primarily of  in proceeds from warrant exercises and  in proceeds from stock option exercises 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of million will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions for at least the next months 
our future long term capital needs will depend significantly on the rate of growth of our business  our rate of loss  the 
table of contents mix of subscription licensing arrangements versus perpetual licenses sold  possible acquisitions  the timing of expanded product offerings and the success of these offerings if and when they are launched 
accordingly  any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our current balance of cash and cash equivalents is insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity needs  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities to raise funds  and those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
in connection with a sale of stock  our stockholders would experience dilution 
in addition  we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 
also  our stock price may make it difficult for us to raise additional equity financing

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without assuming significant risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting primarily of short term investment grade securities 
due to the nature of our investments  we believe there is no material risk exposure 
a change in interest rates  either positive or negative  would not have had a significant effect on either i our cash flows and reported net losses in the years ended december   and  or ii the fair value of our investment portfolio at december  and as of december  and  our cash and cash equivalents consisted entirely of money market investments with remaining maturities of days or less when purchased and non interest bearing checking accounts 
investments in marketable debt securities with maturities greater than days and less than one year are classified as held to maturity short term investments and are recorded at amortized cost 
under current investment guidelines  maturities on short term investments are restricted to one year or less 
at december  and  we held no such short term investments 
investments in auction rate securities  with maturities which can be greater than one year but for which interest rates reset in less than days  are classified as available for sale securities and have been stated at fair market value 
at december  and  we held no auction rate certificates  having disposed of all our previous holdings in such investments during foreign currency exchange risk we operate in certain foreign locations  where the currency used is not the us dollar 
however  these locations have not been  and are not currently expected to be  significant to our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates have not had a material effect on our business
