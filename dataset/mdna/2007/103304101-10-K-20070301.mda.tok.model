we currently own acres on the las vegas strip where the stardust was located and where our echelon place project is currently under development 
beginning in  we have reclassified the reporting of our coast casinos and boulder strip properties so that they are now included together as part of the las vegas locals segment due to their similar market characteristics 
due to the disposition of barbary coast on february  and the south coast on october   the operating results from these two properties are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidating statements of operations 
as such  we have reclassified their results for the years ended december  and to conform to the current presentation

our main business emphasis is on slot revenues  which are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties 
gross revenues are one of the main performance indicators of our properties 
most of our revenue is cash based  and our properties have historically generated significant operating cash flow 
our industry is capital intensive  and we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  pay income taxes  fund maintenance capital expenditures and provide excess cash for future development and the payment of dividends 
overall outlook over the past few years  we have been working to strategically position our company for greater success by strengthening our operating foundation and effecting strategic growth in order to attempt to increase shareholder value

borgata tax credits 
based on new jersey state income tax rules  borgata is eligible for state tax credits under the new jersey new jobs investment tax credit new jobs tax credit because borgata made a qualified investment in a new business facility that created new jobs

on november   we granted options to purchase an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  representing the closing market price of our common stock on that date 
the fair value of this grant combined with our other share based payment awards currently outstanding  will result in estimated share based compensation costs of approximately million for the year ending december  the grant of any additional share based payment awards will increase our estimate of share based compensation costs 
our financial statements for periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r do not reflect any restated amounts related to the adoption of this standard 
deferred rent 
we record deferred rent related to certain of our coast casinos and sam s town shreveport land leases as the cash payments under the associated leases are currently less than the amount of rent expense recorded 
deferred rent increased in due primarily to the full year of deferred rent expense from coast casinos and sam s town shreveport due to their acquisitions 
deferred rent is recorded in selling  general  and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of operations 
write downs and other charges  net 
in  write downs and other charges  net  primarily consist of the following a gain of million recognized upon the final settlement with our insurance carrier for insurance claims related to hurricane damages at delta downs

a consulting agreement signed in connection with blue chip s purchase agreement provided for a million contingent payment if certain tribal gaming facilities had not commenced gaming operations near our blue chip casino by a specified date 
as tribal gaming facilities had not commenced by the specified date  we expensed and paid the million fee during other operating items asset impairment sam s town tunica reported an operating loss of million for the year ended december  due to a history of operating losses at sam s town tunica  we continue to test the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the asset recoverability test requires estimating sam s town tunica s undiscounted future cash flows and comparing that aggregate total to the property s carrying value 
as the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value  we do not believe sam s town tunica s assets to be impaired at this time  however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica and  if necessary  continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets  which could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
we have significant amounts of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of these assets during the second quarter of each year 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows related to these assets are not met  we may be subject to a non cash write down of these assets  which could have a material impact on our consolidated statement of operations

other non operating costs and expenses interest expense  net year ended december  in thousands interest costs less interest costs related to discontinued operations less capitalized interest less interest income interest expense  net weighted average debt balance weighted average interest rate interest costs increased in as compared to due to an increase in the average levels of debt incurred to help finance our expansion projects 
in addition  the interest rates on our variable interest rate debt increased period over period 
capitalized interest decreased in as compared to due primarily to the opening of south coast in december and the completion of the blue chip expansion project in january we expect capitalized interest to increase in due primarily to the echelon place development project and construction of the new hotel tower at blue chip 
included in the loss from discontinued operations is an allocation of interest expense related to the million of debt that was repaid as a result of the south coast disposal transaction  as well as other consolidated interest based on the ratio of i the net assets of our discontinued operations less the debt repaid as a result of the south coast disposal transaction  to ii the sum of total consolidated net assets and consolidated debt of the company  other than the debt repaid as a result of the disposal transaction 
interest costs increased in as compared to due to higher levels of outstanding debt used to help finance our merger with coast casinos and our acquisition of sam s town shreveport 
in addition  the interest rates on our variable rate debt increased in capitalized interest was higher in due to the increased amount of cash expenditures for projects under construction in  such as south coast and the blue chip expansion project 
change in value of derivative instruments during the year ended december   we entered into three forward starting interest rate swaps with a combined notional amount of million 
we determined that these derivative instruments did not meet the requirements for hedge accounting during the reporting period and have therefore recorded a million charge for the change in fair value of these derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations 
effective january   these forward starting swaps met the requirements to qualify for hedge accounting  therefore  any future changes in the effective portion of the change in fair value of these derivative instruments will be recognized in other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheet 
loss on early retirements of debt in  we recorded a loss on early retirement of debt related to our million principal amount of senior notes originally due in the million loss is comprised of the premium related to the call for redemption of these notes  unamortized deferred loan costs and the notes market adjustments from fair value hedges

borgata has significant uses for its cash flows  including maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  interest payments  state income taxes and the repayment of debt 
borgata s cash flows are primarily used for its business needs and are not generally available except to the extent distributions are paid to us to service our indebtedness 
as of december  and we had balances of cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
working capital was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the working capital balance at december  is unusually high due to the reclassification of south coast assets held for sale to current assets  as the sale transaction occurred in october historically  we have operated with minimal or negative levels of working capital in order to minimize borrowings and related interest costs under our bank credit facility 
the revolver portion of our bank credit facility generally provides any necessary funds for our day to day operations  interest and tax payments as well as capital expenditures 
on a daily basis  we evaluate our cash position and adjust our revolver balance as necessary by either paying it down with excess cash or borrowing under the revolver 
we also plan the timing and the amounts of our capital expenditures 
we believe that our bank credit facility and cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and maintenance capital expenditures for the next twelve months 
the source of funds for our development projects such as blue chip s new hotel tower  echelon place and dania beach  florida is expected to come primarily from cash flows from operations  availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs  as well as additional funds that are expected to be generated from incremental bank financing or other additional debt 
we could also fund these projects with equity offerings 
additional financing may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
cash flows from investing activities cash paid for capital expenditures on major projects and land acquisitions for the year ended december   included the following south coast expansion project  the majority of which was substantially complete on october   the date on which it was sold  acquisition of north las vegas land  acquisition of land and building for our new corporate office  hurricane restoration costs at delta downs  the new blue chip vessel that opened in january  and echelon place 
spending on these and other expansion projects totaled million in maintenance capital expenditures totaled million in cash flows from investing activities during include million in cash from the sale of the south coast and million of property insurance recoveries for the reimbursement of our capital spending related to our hurricane restoration project at delta downs

spending on these and other projects totaled million in maintenance capital expenditures totaled million in capital expenditures in included cash paid for the blue chip  south coast and delta downs projects noted above that were also in progress during in addition  capital expenditures in included million for the orleans hotel tower and the purchase of land adjacent to the stardust for a purchase price of million  for which we paid million in cash and assumed million in debt 
also in  we paid net cash of million for the acquisition of the partnership interests of sam s town shreveport and we paid net cash of million for the acquisition of coast casinos 
cash flows from financing activities substantially all of the funding for our acquisitions and our renovation and expansion projects comes from cash flows from existing operations  as well as debt financing and equity issuances 
on january   we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february the million of net proceeds from this debt issuance was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility 
during  we redeemed the entire million principal amount of our senior notes originally due in for approximately million  funded by availability under our bank credit facility 
in  we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due april our net proceeds from the issuance of these notes were approximately million  from which we repaid approximately million of outstanding indebtedness under our bank credit facility 
we used approximately million of the net proceeds from this issuance to pay for a portion of the shreveport acquisition 
we began paying quarterly dividends in dividends are declared at the discretion of our board of directors 
we are subject to certain limitations regarding the payment of dividends  such as restricted payment limitations related to our outstanding notes and our bank credit facility 
other items affecting liquidity development projects echelon place 
in january  we announced plans to develop echelon place on the las vegas strip 
we expect to commence construction in the second quarter  with a planned third quarter opening 
we recently completed the schematic design phase of the project and have increased the budget for the wholly owned components of echelon place to billion  principally as a result of additional scope  larger guest rooms and suites  and increased estimated construction costs 
we continue to perform design and development work on the two joint venture elements of echelon place  which include a retail promenade and our hotel joint venture with morgans hotel group llc  or morgans 
echelon place will include a total of approximately  rooms in five unique hotels  including the following amenities casino space  square feet entertainment venues  seat and  seat theaters  operated by aeg live retail promenade  square feet meeting and convention space  square feet parking approximately  spaces echelon place will also include approximately dining  nightlife and beverage venues in addition to an approximately acre multi level pool and recreation deck 
on february   we exchanged the barbary coast for acres  which will bring our total land holdings to contiguous acres on the echelon place site 
the additional land allowed us to modify the site layout of echelon place  increases the overall size of the project to acres and will provide us with two additional parcels of six and acres that could allow for the addition of another distinct hotel  a residential component  and additional retail  dining  meeting and casino space 
in connection with our joint venture with morgans to develop  construct and operate the delano las vegas and the mondrian las vegas hotels  we will contribute approximately acres of land and morgans will contribute million to the venture  and the venture will arrange non recourse project financing 
morgans is expected to begin construction in the first quarter blue chip 
in october  we announced a million expansion project at blue chip that will add a second hotel with approximately guest rooms to our existing room hotel  a spa and fitness center  additional meeting and event space as well as more dining and nightlife experiences 
we expect to begin construction on the project during the first quarter and it is expected to open in late other opportunities we regularly investigate and pursue additional expansion opportunities in markets where casino gaming is currently permitted 
we also pursue expansion opportunities in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
such expansions will be affected and determined by several key factors  including outcome of license selection processes  approval of gaming in jurisdictions where we have been active but where casino gaming is not currently permitted  identification of additional suitable investment opportunities in current gaming jurisdictions  and availability of acceptable financing 
additional projects may require us to make substantial investments or may cause us to incur substantial costs related to the investigation and pursuit of such opportunities  which investments and costs we may fund through cash flow from operations or availability under our bank credit facility 
to the extent such sources of funds are not sufficient  we may also seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing will be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
acquisition of dania jai alai 
on june   we entered into a purchase agreement to acquire dania jai alai and approximately acres of related land located in dania beach  florida 
dania jai alai is one of four pari mutuel facilities approved under florida law to operate  class iii slot machines 
we expect to finance the acquisition through availability under our bank credit facility 
on august   a three judge panel of the first district court of appeals in broward county  florida overturned a lower court decision which in turn could lead to the invalidation of a november initiative approved by florida voters to operate slot machines at certain pari mutuel gaming facilities in broward county 
this decision was essentially reaffirmed by the first district court of appeals on november   with two questions being certified to the florida supreme court 
if the initiative is invalidated  we may not be able to operate slot machines at the dania jai alai facility  which would materially affect any potential cash flow and revenue expected from the dania jai alai facility 
see part i  item a 
risk factors we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 
in february  we received our slot license for our acquisition of dania jai alai 
we also modified our agreement to purchase this operation 
under the revised agreement  we are required to pay an aggregate of million at closing of this transaction  and we will be required to pay an additional million in march  or earlier  if certain conditions are satisfied 
we will not record a liability for the additional million obligation until the contingency has been resolved and the consideration is distributable 
at that time  the million payment will be added to the cost of the acquisition 
we closed the transaction on march  and we plan to begin construction in the second half of with a grand opening of the casino operation around the end of north las vegas locals casino 
in february  we purchased a acre parcel in north las vegas for approximately million for the development of a las vegas locals casino 
we plan on developing a full service casino hotel on this site  however  we do not anticipate beginning construction in mid as previously contemplated  as we are continuing to evaluate the development of infrastructure improvements and the pace of population growth in the area 
we can provide no assurances that our expansion and development projects will be completed within our current estimates  commence operations as expected  include all of the anticipated amenities  features or facilities or achieve market acceptance 
in addition  our development projects are subject to those additional risks inherent in the development and operation of a new or expanded business enterprise  including potential unanticipated operating problems 
also see part i  item a 
risk factors our expansion  development and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy  including receipt of necessary government approvals 
if our expansion or development projects do not become operational within the time frame and project costs currently contemplated or do not successfully compete in their markets  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
once our projects become operational  they will face many of the same risks that our current properties face including  but not limited to  increases in taxes due to changes in legislation 
the source of funds for these projects is expected to come from cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility  to the extent availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
we could also fund these projects with incremental bank financing  additional debt or equity offerings 
additional financing may not be available to us  or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
barbary coast exchange 
on february   we completed the transaction to exchange the barbary coast for acres of land adjacent to our echelon place development project on the las vegas strip  and we expect to record a non cash  pre tax gain of approximately million during the quarter ending march  the additional land has allowed us to modify the site layout of echelon place and increased the overall size of the project to acres 
indebtedness our long term debt primarily consists of a bank credit facility and senior subordinated notes

on january   we issued million principal amount of senior subordinated notes due february the net proceeds of this debt issuance were approximately million which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving portion of our bank credit facility 
bank credit facility covenants 
our bank credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including  without limitation  various covenants i requiring the maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  ii establishing a maximum permitted total leverage ratio and senior leverage ratio  iii imposing limitations of the incurrence of additional secured indebtedness and iv imposing restrictions on investments  dividends and certain other payments 
we believe we are in compliance with the bank credit facility covenants at december  notes 
our million  million  million and million principal amounts of senior subordinated notes due    and  respectively  contain limitations on  among other things  i our ability and our restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures governing the notes ability to incur additional indebtedness  ii the payment of dividends and other distributions with respect to our capital stock and of our restricted subsidiaries and the purchase  redemption or retirement of our capital stock and our restricted subsidiaries  iii the making of certain investments  iv asset sales  v the incurrence of liens  vi transactions with affiliates  vii payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries  and viii certain consolidations  mergers and transfers of assets 
we believe we are in compliance with the covenants related to notes outstanding at december  our ability to service our debt will be dependent on future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at each maturity 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payme nts due by period in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt obligations    capital lease obligations operating lease obligations    interest obligations on fixed rate debt    purchase obligations entertainment contracts   construction projects   other    other long term contracts  total contractual obligations    includes interest rate obligations on our fixed rate debt that comprises billion of our total december  debt balance of billion 
our variable rate debt at december  consists of billion in outstanding balances on our bank credit facility 
interest payments for future periods related to the variable rate debt are dependent upon certain items including future eurodollar rates and the outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility  that fluctuate from period to period and have not been presented in this table 
at december   the blended interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility was 
construction projects consist primarily of purchase obligations related to the echelon place development project 
other consists of various contracts for goods and services  including our contract for hawaiian air charter operations 
other long term obligations relate primarily to deferred compensation balances at december  certain of our executive officers participate in a long term management incentive plan the plan  which currently extends through december  certain components of the plan cannot be measured until the end of the performance period  as they will not be known until the end of the performance period 
as such  we do not accrue for these items over the life of the plan  but rather accrue for that portion of the plan when it becomes measureable 
estimated possible future maximum payouts are million in  million in and million in in  we entered into a joint venture agreement with morgans as part of the development for echelon place 
in conjunction with this joint venture agreement  we expect to contribute approximately acres of land and morgans will contribute approximately million to the venture  and that the venture will arrange non recourse project financing to develop two hotel properties  the delano las vegas and the mondrian las vegas 
we are required to pay to the city of kenner  louisiana  a boarding fee of for each passenger boarding our treasure chest riverboat casino during the year 
the future minimum payment due in to the city of kenner  based upon a portion of actual passenger counts from the prior year  is approximately million 
in  the illinois legislature passed new legislation for wagering taxes that imposes a minimum wagering tax for casinos for the next two state based fiscal years ending june  under these minimum wagering tax provisions  during each of the state s fiscal years ending june  and  par a dice will be required to remit to the state the amount  if any  by which million exceeds the wagering taxes actually paid by par a dice during each of those fiscal years 
the payments  if any  are required by each of june  and par a dice paid million for illinois state wagering taxes on june  effective july   we incorporated this minimum payment provision into the effective gaming tax rate for par a dice 
in addition  par a dice paid million on june  for a retroactive illinois gaming tax assessment  which was the result of a modification by the illinois state legislature requiring licensees to pay an additional tax on adjusted gross gaming revenues retroactive to july  off balance sheet arrangements 
our off balance sheet arrangements mainly consist of investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which is primarily our investment in borgata 
we have not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than straightforward interest rate swaps and collars 
our joint venture investments allow us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that lessens our initial investment 
we do not guarantee financing obtained by borgata nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the respective properties 
we have entered into certain agreements that contain indemnification provisions such as indemnification agreements with our executive officers and directors and provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that provide for indemnification of our directors  officers  employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits all companies to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
at each subsequent reporting date  a company shall report in earnings any unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the company also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements see below 
we are currently evaluating whether to adopt the fair value option under this sfas no 
and evaluating what impact such adoption would have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires employers to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income 
this statement also requires employers to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end and is effective for publicly traded companies as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements as we do not currently have a defined benefit postretirement plan that meets the criteria specified under sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which adds section n to topic  financial statements 
section n provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
to provide full disclosure  registrants electing not to restate prior periods should reflect the effects of initially applying the guidance in topic n in their financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and applies to all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  disclosure requirements for taxes assessed by a governmental authority on revenue producing transactions 
the consensus allows companies to choose between two acceptable alternatives based on their accounting policies for transactions in which the company collects taxes on behalf of a governmental authority  such as sales taxes 
under the gross method  taxes collected are accounted for as a component of sales revenue with an offsetting expense 
conversely  the net method allows a reduction to sales revenue 
if such taxes are reported gross and are significant  companies should disclose the amount of those taxes 
the guidance should be applied to financial reports through retrospective application for all periods presented  if amounts are significant  for interim and annual reporting beginning february  we have historically presented sales net of tax collected and we do not intend to change our policy  therefore  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
sfas no 
allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to irrevocably account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  as we do not currently have any financial instruments that meet the criteria specified under sfas no 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets 
we evaluate our goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
related to goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
related to impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and intangible assets  we review the carrying values on an annual basis and between annual dates in certain circumstances 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
inherent in the reviews of the carrying amounts of the above assets are various estimates 
first  management must determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold or disposed of  it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
this means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have tested the assets of sam s town tunica for recoverability during due to a history of operating losses 
as the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value  we do not believe these assets to be impaired at this time  however  we will continue to monitor the performance of sam s town tunica as well as continue to update our asset recoverability test under sfas no 
if future asset recoverability tests indicate that the assets of sam s town tunica are impaired  we will be subject to a non cash write down of its assets which would likely have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on july   we entered into a unit purchase agreement  as amended  the agreement to sell south coast to michael j 
gaughan for a total purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with entering into the agreement  we met all of the criteria required to classify certain of the assets and liabilities of south coast as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets 
as such  we ceased depreciation of those assets and they were measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
this resulted in an estimated non cash  pretax impairment charge of million in september  as the fair value of the assets were less than their carrying value at that time 
we recorded a million non cash charge related to the write off of the net book value of the original blue chip gaming vessel in june  which was replaced with a new gaming vessel in conjunction with our expansion project 
after analysis of alternative uses for the original vessel  management decided in june to permanently retire the asset from further operations 
we recorded a million asset write down during the year ended december  related to land held for sale in pennsylvania that we previously planned to utilize as a site for a gaming operation 
in september  we withdrew our application for gaming approval  which led to our decision to sell the land 
we determined that the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita was a triggering event requiring impairment tests for treasure chest and delta downs assets during our impairment tests were based upon estimated future cash flows from these properties 
based upon the results of the tests  no impairment was indicated for any of the assets tested 
because we intend to redevelop the land on which stardust is located and our plans include demolishing stardust s existing buildings and abandoning other related assets  we performed an impairment test for this property 
based upon the results of this test  we recorded a million non cash impairment loss in to write down the long lived assets of the stardust to their estimated fair value 
capital expenditures and depreciation 
we must also make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent upon the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
in connection with the closure and demolition of stardust  we reevaluated the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets residing on the land associated with our echelon place development project  including our corporate office building  and recorded million of accelerated depreciation expense in capitalized interest 
we capitalize interest costs associated with major construction projects as part of the cost of the constructed assets 
when no debt is incurred specifically for a project  interest is capitalized on amounts expended for the project using our weighted average cost of borrowing 
capitalization of interest ceases when the project or discernible portions of the project are complete 
we amortize capitalized interest over the estimated useful life of the related asset 
derivative instruments 
we utilize an investment policy for managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating rate to fixed or fixed rate to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain or loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
at december   we had ten derivative instruments outstanding with a total notional amount of million 
one of these derivative instruments is a fixed to floating swap with a million notional amount that meets the criteria for fair value hedge accounting established by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 as well as the criteria for the shortcut method  which allows for an assumption of no ineffectiveness 
as such  there was no net impact on our consolidated statement of operations from changes in value of the hedging instrument 
instead  the fair value of the instrument is recorded as either an asset or liability on our consolidated balance sheets with offsetting adjustments to the carrying values of the related debt 
as such  at december  and  we recorded a long term asset of million and million  respectively  on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  representing the fair market value of the swap at that date 
the corresponding net adjustment increased the carrying value of the long term debt items hedged  as the interest rate swap is considered highly effective under the criteria established by gaap 
at december   we also had four floating to fixed derivative instruments and two interest rate collars with an aggregate notional amount of million designated as cash flow hedges 
on a quarterly basis  we monitor the effectiveness of these derivatives and record any ineffectiveness in our consolidated statements of operations 
our derivative instruments are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value 
for the six contracts discussed  we recorded a non current asset of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in september  we entered into three floating to fixed interest rate swaps with a forward start date of june   with a combined notional amount of million 
we determined that these derivative instruments did not meet the requirements to qualify for hedge accounting and have therefore recorded a million charge for the change in fair value of these derivative instruments in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  stock based employee compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method and as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
this statement requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
this cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the modified prospective method  we expense the cost of share based compensation awards issued after january  additionally  we recognize compensation cost for the portion of awards outstanding on january  for which the requisite service has not been rendered over the period the requisite service is being rendered after january  compensation expense related to stock option awards is calculated based on the fair value of each major option grant on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model that requires the formation of assumptions to be used in the model  such as expected stock volatility  risk free interest rates  expected option lives and dividend yields 
we formed our assumptions using historical experience and observable conditions 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcome of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on past experiences 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes relating to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates or when potential actions are settled differently than we expected  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the current period 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for employee heath coverage  workers compensation and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
litigation  claims and assessments 
we also utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events and also upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term eurodollar rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon the agent bank s quoted base rate or the eurodollar rate  plus applicable margins  however  the amount of outstanding borrowings is expected to fluctuate from time to time 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
for more information  see note  derivative instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we utilized interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific debt obligations 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   however  we believe that this risk is minimized because we monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties to the swaps 
if we had terminated our swaps as of december   we would have been entitled to receive a net total of million based on the fair values of the derivative instruments 
the following table provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest swaps and debt obligations 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for our interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by the expected contractual maturity dates 
the notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts
