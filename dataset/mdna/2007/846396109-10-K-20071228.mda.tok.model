item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information on price increases for polyurethane foam 
as of september   we had unshipped orders of approximately million  which represents a increase compared to our backlog at fiscal year end all orders in the current backlog are expected to be filled in the fiscal year 
employees we had full time employees as of september  of these employees  six were officers  were management personnel  were administrative and clerical personnel  were sales personnel  and were manufacturing employees 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and have never experienced an interruption or curtailment of operations due to labor controversy 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
supervision and regulation the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and regulations issued or proposed thereunder  provide for regulation by the food and drug administration the fda of the marketing  manufacture  labeling  packaging and distribution of medical devices  including our products 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various types of reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations and do not anticipate having to make any material expenditures as a result of fda or other regulatory requirements 
we are certified as an iso and iso supplier for our pressureguard mattress products from the greenville  south carolina plant 
these standards are prepared by the american society for quality control standards committee to correspond to the international standard iso iso the international organization for standardization is a worldwide federation of national standards bodies dealing with quality system requirements that can be used by a supplier to demonstrate its capability and for the assessment of the capability of a supplier by external parties 
compliance with iso standard is required by health canada for all class ii medical devices sold there 
all of our powered medical therapeutic support surfaces are considered class ii medical devices 
the certification is subject to reassessment at six month intervals 
we have maintained our certification based on the results of iso audits conducted during fiscal year environmental matters our manufacturing operations are subject to various government regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations 
we do not anticipate that continued compliance will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
item a 
risk factors the loss of a key distributor or customer in the company s medical or custom products segments could cause a rapid and significant sales decline  which would likely result in a decline in earnings 
many of our medical products are sold through large national distributors in the united states and canada 
we do not maintain long term distribution agreements with most of these distributors 
instead  we supply them based on purchase orders that are issued by the customers on a daily or weekly basis 
these supplier customer relationships can generally be ended by either party with minimal notice 
consequently  if a large customer or distributor decided to discontinue purchasing our products  our sales and earnings could quickly decline 
our largest customers in the medical segment are hill rom and mckesson medical surgical 
in addition  all of our consumer foam products are sold through our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company  under a marketing and distribution agreement that expires in december the agreement automatically renews for successive three year terms unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew at least days prior to the expiration date 
as we have previously disclosed  our agreement to supply hill rom with private label therapeutic support surfaces will expire in may hill rom was our largest customer in the medical segment in fiscal with sales of approximately million 
we expect to continue to supply products to hill rom under the terms of the agreement until the agreement expiration date 
following the expiration date  we expect to continue supplying products to hill rom on an order by order basis 
the current agreement provides for mutual exclusivity regarding products that feature non powered  self adjusting technology similar to our cft product 
the expiration of the agreement will allow us to sell our proprietary pressureguard cft therapeutic support surfaces to customers other than hill rom  and hill rom will be able to purchase similar products from other suppliers 
at this time due to lack of information from hill rom regarding its expected demand for our products  we are unable to forecast future sales of our products to hill rom 
there can be no assurance that sales of our cft to other customers will offset any decline in sales to hill rom

our earnings could be negatively affected by raw material cost increases that we are unable to recover through sales price increases or expense reductions 
the cost of polyurethane foam represented approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal an increase in foam raw material costs that we are not able to offset through sales price increases or expense reductions could have a significant negative effect on our profitability 
besides polyurethane foam  our other major raw material categories include nylon mattress covers  vinyl bags  vinyl air cylinders  electronic components for mattresses and corrugated cartons 
raw materials are our single largest cost category in the business  representing approximately of our total cost of goods sold in fiscal cost increases in these raw materials could have a significant adverse effect on earnings if we are unable to recover the higher costs through sales price increases or expense reductions 
our sales volume could decline as a result of competition from low cost foreign imports 
within the last two years  we have experienced increased competition in our medical and custom products segments from low cost foreign imports 
in the medical segment  the number of low cost  imported mattress products has increased in the last two years  but it has not yet had a significant impact on our medical business 
we believe that we have potentially greater exposure to low cost imports in our consumer bedding product lines because those products have more commodity like characteristics than our medical products and our customers  who are generally national retailers  are more likely to change suppliers to buy lower cost products 
therefore  we could lose significant parts of our consumer bedding business and certain parts of our medical business if we are unable to compete effectively with low cost imports 
our medical business could lose sales volume or could have lower sales growth rates as a result of government reimbursement changes in the medical market 
a number of our medical products are eligible for reimbursement by medicare 
we receive no direct reimbursements from medicare  but our customers often submit reimbursement requests to medicare 
for example  we sell therapeutic mattresses to home health care dealers who in turn rent our mattresses to patients 
medicare reimburses the dealers for some or all of the patient s rental cost 
if medicare reimbursement rates are reduced  the demand for our medical products that are covered by medicare would likely be reduced 
certain of our medical products are classified as medical devices and are regulated by the fda 
these regulations require  among other things  that medical device manufacturers register with the fda  list devices manufactured by them  and file various types of reports 
in addition  our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections by regulatory authorities and must comply with good manufacturing practices as required by the fda and state regulatory authorities 
although we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable regulations  the existence of the regulations creates the risk of a product recall and related expenses as well as the risk of additional expenses required to meet the regulatory requirements 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none item properties we own our principal office and manufacturing facility which is located in greenville  south carolina 
this facility contains approximately  square feet used by the medical and custom products segments and is located on a acre site 
in fiscal  we completed a  square foot addition to our plant in greenville  which is included in the square footage total above 
we believe our current manufacturing and storage space is adequate to support our operations during the next several years  depending on sales growth rates 
we also lease  square feet of warehouse space in salt lake city  utah for use as a distribution center for our medical products 
the lease rate for the facility is  per month 
the lease expires in august unless renewed by mutual agreement 
we currently expect to renew the agreement in  but we will evaluate other alternatives before the renewal date 
we consider the south carolina and utah facilities to be suitable and adequate for their intended purposes 
item legal proceedings from time to time we are a party to various legal actions arising in the normal course of business 
we believe that as a result of legal defenses and insurance arrangements with parties believed to be financially capable  there are no proceedings threatened or pending against us that  if determined adversely  would have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations

our revenues  profits and cash flows are derived from the development  manufacture and sale of these products 
in the medical segment  we manufacture and market a comprehensive selection of pressure management products  including geo matt  pressureguard  geo mattress  span aids  isch dish  and selan products 
in the custom products segment  we manufacture consumer mattress pads and pillows for the retail bedding market and various engineered foam products for the industrial market 
our consumer mattress pads and pillows are marketed by our exclusive distributor  louisville bedding company 
we sell the industrial product line directly to our customers 
in october  following our fiscal year end  we decided to exit the safety catheter business and sell the related assets because we had not been able to generate sufficient sales volume to make the segment a viable business 
consequently  we recorded a million impairment charge in fiscal to eliminate the book value of the safety catheter assets 
the impairment charge and related items are more fully discussed below 
we will have only two segments in fiscal medical and custom products 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal the sales increase was the result of higher sales volumes in both the medical and custom products segments 
medical sales increased to million 
sales in the custom products segment rose by to million 
net income declined in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the results included a one time  non cash impairment charge of million million  or per share  after tax related to the exit and proposed sale of our safety catheter business 
excluding the impairment charge  net income would have been million  or per diluted share  up compared with the results 
this discussion contains several references to what our expenses or earnings would have been if we had excluded the impairment charge resulting from our decision to exit the safety catheter segment 
the impairment charge was unusual  non recurring and non cash 
management considers the non gaap measures useful  and we believe they are useful to investors  to show the performance in fiscal of the two segments of our business that are continuing the medical products and custom products segments 
beginning with reports in fiscal  the safety catheter segment will be shown as a discontinued operation in accordance with gaap  and our future managements discussion and analysis will be comprised largely of a discussion of only the two continuing segments 
we believe including the non gaap measures in this report will enhance the comparability of this report to future reports 
sales total sales in the core medical business grew to million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal sales of therapeutic support surfaces our largest medical product line rose in fiscal to million and represented of total medical sales 
we sell these specialty mattresses to hospitals  long term care facilities and home care dealers throughout the united states and canada 
medical sales accounted for of total net sales in each of fiscal years and product line growth leaders within the therapeutic support surface group were the pressureguard cft  which includes private label products manufactured for hill rom  the geo mattress line of all foam support surfaces and the pressureguard easy air low air loss support surfaces 
in other medical product lines  sales of wheelchair seating products increased by  patient positioners were up by and overlays and selan skin care products each rose by 
we expect medical sales for fiscal to be affected by the expiration in may of our existing manufacturing agreement with hill rom 
hill rom was our largest medical customer in fiscal  representing sales of approximately million  which made up of medical sales and of total company sales in fiscal we expect to continue to supply hill rom under the current agreement through the may expiration date 
thereafter  we expect to continue to supply hill rom on an order by order basis 
consequently  we expect our sales to hill rom to decline in fiscal  but we are unable to forecast future hill rom sales at this time due to lack of information from them regarding expected demand for our products 
we remain optimistic about the growth prospects for the non hill rom parts of our medical business in fiscal and beyond 
we expect steady growth in our non hill rom medical business in fiscal  which should partially offset anticipated declines in sales to hill rom  however  there can be no assurance to this effect 
our product innovation has been a major factor in our past sales growth  and we plan to continue new product development efforts 
medical products introduced during the past three years accounted for approximately of medical sales in fiscal our custom products segment consists of consumer bedding products and specialty foam products for the industrial market 
sales in the custom products segment increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal all of the sales growth was attributable to consumer bedding products  which were up to million compared with million last year 
this increase was the result of sales of the new fusion mattress overlays to wal mart and other retailers through our marketing partner  louisville bedding company 
the fusion overlays combine the performance of traditional foam with the feel and features of visco foam to give customers a unique bedding choice 
wal mart has advised us that it plans to expand the number of its stores that carry the fusion consumer mattress overlay 
as a result  we expect consumer sales in fiscal to be higher than those of fiscal in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales were flat at million as sales growth from existing and new customers was offset by lost business from a key customer related to price competition 
we believe industrial sales in fiscal will be slightly higher than those of fiscal sales in the safety catheter segment were  in fiscal and consisted of  in sales of secure iv catheters and  in sales of the huberpro infusion sets 
sales of secure iv were  in fiscal and sales of huberpro were  results in the safety catheter business continued to be below our expectations 
as a result and as more fully discussed herein  we have exited the safety catheter business and are pursuing the sale of the related assets 
gross profit our gross profit increased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal gross margin rose to for fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit level was due to higher sales volumes and lower manufacturing costs as a percent of sales 
the reduction in manufacturing costs as a percent of sales was due to improved production efficiencies  cost savings from various process improvement projects  and from closing our california manufacturing plant and replacing it with a distribution center in utah 
we also benefitted from the relative stability of raw material costs during fiscal we expect our gross margin during fiscal to be lower than that of fiscal because of expected declines in sales to hill rom as described above and an expected shift in sales mix toward the lower margin custom products segment 
selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased to million  but declined to of net sales in fiscal compared with of sales and million in fiscal most of the dollar increase occurred in the medical segment and was due to costs related to our new distribution center in utah and higher commissions and shipping expenses related to higher sales volumes 
we believe that total selling and marketing expenses for fiscal will increase over levels 
total research and development expenses increased to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal in the medical segment  r d expenses increased in fiscal to  compared with  in the expense increase in the medical segment was related to new product development efforts 
in the safety catheter segment  r d expenses decreased in fiscal to  compared with  in we expect total r d expenses in fiscal to be lower than those of fiscal due to the absence of safety catheter r d expenses 
administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was mainly the result of higher incentive compensation  professional fees and bad debt expense 
we expect administrative expenses for fiscal to be similar to levels 
the safety catheter segment showed an operating loss of million in fiscal  which included the effect of the million impairment charge previously described 
excluding the impairment charge  our operating loss in the safety catheter segment would have been million  which is approximately level compared with fiscal the history of operating losses and our inability to generate sufficient sales volume to make it a viable business contributed to our decision to exit the business and the resulting impairment charge 
the impairment charge was million pre tax  or million per share after taxes  and it eliminated of the book value of the safety catheter assets 
we are now actively engaged in efforts to sell this part of our business 
proceeds from a future sale of these assets  if any  will be recorded as income from discontinued operations 
the custom products segment also showed an operating loss in fiscal but the loss decreased to  per diluted share after taxes compared with million per diluted share after taxes in fiscal the decrease in the custom products operating loss was primarily caused by the increase in sales volume of consumer bedding products and improved manufacturing efficiencies 
the custom products segment receives an allocated share of our total manufacturing overhead and administrative expenses 
since these allocated expenses are largely fixed within a reasonable range of sales volume  a sales decline within the segment can result in a proportionally larger decline in segment operating income 
however  we believe that the custom products segment makes a positive contribution to our earnings because it absorbs overhead and administrative expenses that would otherwise be reallocated to the medical segment if we exited the custom products business 
if that occurred and nothing else changed  the medical segment and the total company would be less profitable 
total operating income rose to million compared with million in fiscal excluding the million impairment charge  fiscal operating income would have been a record million  a increase over fiscal operating income 
non operating income investment income increased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase in investment income was the result of higher interest rates and slightly higher average balances of marketable securities during fiscal we expect investment income in fiscal to be significantly lower than in because we liquidated our short term investments during fiscal to partially fund the special dividend paid in june we received no royalty income in fiscal as a result of the expiration in december of our license agreement for the safety lok shielded syringe product formerly licensed to becton dickinson and company bd 
the license agreement ended due to the expiration of the related patents 
we received the final royalty payment from bd in february and recorded  of royalty income in fiscal other non operating income for included a  gain on the sale of manufacturing equipment 
other non operating income for included a  gain on the sale of manufacturing equipment 
we expect total non operating income for fiscal to be significantly lower than levels because of the liquidation of our short term investments to pay the special  one time dividend more fully described below 
interest expense fiscal results included  in interest expense incurred from the addition of million in debt to partially fund the per share special dividend paid on june  no comparable interest expense was incurred in fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion about the special dividend 
net income and dividends net income for fiscal decreased to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the results included a one time  non cash impairment charge of million million  or per share  after tax related to the exit and proposed sale of our safety catheter business 
excluding the impairment charge  net income for fiscal would have been million  or per diluted share  up compared with the results 
we expect earnings for fiscal to decline from the adjusted million per diluted share level due to our anticipated reduction in sales to hill rom as previously described 
the expected earnings decrease related to the anticipated hill rom sales decline should be partially offset by eliminating the losses associated with the safety catheter business and by expected growth in our non hill rom medical business and our custom products business  however  there can be no assurance to this effect 
see item a risk factors in this report 
overall  we expect earnings for fiscal to be higher than reported earnings for fiscal but lower than fiscal earnings adjusted to exclude the impairment charge 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of approximately million  or of net income  for the year 
this amount consisted of a special dividend of per share  one quarterly dividend of per share and three quarterly dividends of per share 
results of operations fiscal vs 
summary net sales in fiscal increased to million compared with million in fiscal the sales increase was the result of higher volumes in the medical segment where sales increased to million 
sales in the custom products segment fell by to million 
net income rose in fiscal to a record million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase in earnings resulted mainly from higher unit sales in our pressureguard line of therapeutic support surfaces for the medical segment and a decline in research and development expenses in the safety catheter segment compared with fiscal sales sales in our medical segment rose to million in fiscal compared with million the previous year 
the medical sales growth was led by our proprietary therapeutic support surfaces or mattresses  sales of which increased by over levels 
we sell these specialty mattresses to hospitals  long term care facilities and home care dealers throughout the united states and canada 
our pressureguard cft support surfaces  which are sold primarily in the acute care market  made up about two thirds of the total growth in the medical segment 
other top performing mattress products included the pressureguard apm alternating pressure mattresses  the pressureguard easy air low air loss mattress and our private label therapeutic surfaces manufactured for hill rom 
the apm and easy air products are sold primarily in the long term care and home care sections of the medical market 
in other medical product lines  selan skin care products rose by 
mattress overlay sales were up by 
sales of seating products increased  and sales of patient positioners climbed by 
the majority of the sales increases in our positioners  seating and overlay product lines were due to sales price increases that were passed along to customers in response to raw material cost increases we received in the first quarter of fiscal our medical business achieved solid growth in fiscal primarily because of increased customer demand for our therapeutic support surfaces  particularly in the long term care market  and the success of our private label support surfaces in the acute care market 
therapeutic support surfaces made up approximately of our total medical sales in fiscal  and were our fastest growing medical product lines during the year 
sales in the custom products segment declined during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the entire decline occurred in the consumer portion of the custom products segment  where sales of consumer bedding products were down to million 
the consumer sales decline was caused primarily by the phase out of our previous line of geo comfort foam overlays sold to wal mart  increased competition from imported and domestic visco foam products and lost business to one customer that was acquired by a larger company 
the weakness in consumer sales was the main factor causing the operating loss in the custom products segment during fiscal to help reverse this trend  we developed a new fusion mattress overlay during the year  which began shipping late in our fourth fiscal quarter 
the fusion pad replaces the geo comfort line and is being sold under wal mart s hometrends brand 
we are also selling the fusion products to other retailers 
in the other part of the custom products segment  industrial sales increased by to million 
the industrial sales increase was primarily attributable to higher demand from existing customers 
sales in the safety catheter segment were  in fiscal and consisted of  in sales of secure iv catheters and  in sales of the huberpro infusion sets 
sales of secure iv were  in fiscal there were no comparable huberpro sales in the year earlier period 
gross profit our gross profit level increased by during fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the gross profit margin percentage remained level at 
the increase in gross profit level was due to higher sales volumes in the medical segment 
the medical segment typically has a higher gross margin than the custom products segment because many of our medical products are patented and proprietary 
in addition  higher material costs were also partly offset by lower labor costs due to improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower overtime requirements related to higher inventory levels 
selling  research development and administrative expenses selling and marketing expenses increased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of sales  in fiscal most of the increase occurred in the medical segment and was due to higher expenses for commissions and shipping costs related to higher sales volumes 
total research and development expenses decreased to  in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the entire decrease occurred in the safety catheter segment where r d expenses dropped by  or  to  compared with  in the prior year 
r d expenses were high in the safety catheter segment during the first three quarters of fiscal because of design changes being made to secure iv the design changes were completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which significantly lowered r d expenses related to secure iv in fiscal we consider safety catheters to be a separate reportable segment based on product type and distribution channels 
see notes and in the notes to financial statements for additional information on the safety catheter segment 
in the medical segment  r d expenses increased in fiscal to  compared with  in  offsetting part of the expense decline in the safety catheter segment 
the expense increase in the medical segment was related to new product development efforts 
general and administrative expenses remained level at million in fiscal increases in incentive compensation and bad debt expense were offset by a decline in insurance expense 
the operating loss in the safety catheter segment for fiscal declined by to million per diluted share after taxes compared with million per diluted share after taxes in fiscal the decline in operating loss was primarily due to a reduction in r d expenses 
the custom products segment also showed an operating loss in fiscal the custom products operating loss for fiscal increased to million per diluted share after taxes compared with a loss of  per diluted share after taxes in fiscal the increase in the operating loss was primarily caused by the decline in sales volume of consumer bedding products as described above 
total operating profit increased to million compared to million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher sales volume in the medical segment and lower r d expenses in the safety catheter segment 
non operating income investment income increased by to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal the increase in investment income was the result of higher interest rates and slightly higher average balances of marketable securities in fiscal royalty income fell in fiscal to  compared with  in fiscal as a result of the expiration in december of our license agreement for the safety lok shielded syringe product licensed to becton dickinson and company bd 
the license agreement ended due to the expiration of the related patents 
we received the final royalty payment from bd in february other non operating income for included a  gain on the sale of manufacturing equipment 
net income and dividends net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to higher sales volume in the medical segment  lower r d expenses in the safety catheter segment and lower labor costs due to improved manufacturing efficiencies 
during fiscal  we paid dividends of approximately  or of net income  for the year 
this amount consisted of three quarterly dividends of per share and one quarterly dividend of per share 
liquidity and capital resources we generated cash from operations of million during fiscal  which was a increase compared with cash flow of million in fiscal the major factors contributing to the increased cash flow during the year were higher earnings as adjusted for the non cash impairment charge  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a smaller increase in inventory as adjusted for the non cash write off of safety catheter inventory  and decreases in prepaid expenses and other assets 
the balance sheet components of these changes are described below 
working capital decreased by million  or  to million during fiscal the decrease resulted from the payment of the special dividend as noted above 
the special dividend paid in june and the regular quarterly dividend paid at the same time were funded from the combination of million in newly acquired long term debt and million in cash on hand and cash generated from the liquidation of short term investments 
our current ratio decreased to at september  from at fiscal year end accounts receivable  net of allowances  increased to million at the end of fiscal compared with million at the end of fiscal the increase resulted from higher sales in the fourth quarter of the days sales outstanding or average collection time  calculated using a month average for accounts receivable balances  decreased to days in compared with days in the decrease in day s sales outstanding is the result of increases in consumer bedding sales and sales to hill rom  both of which tend to have faster average collection times than our broader customer base 
we expect our average collection time to increase in fiscal as the result of anticipated lower sales to hill rom and higher sales to a broader medical customer base 
all of our accounts receivable are unsecured 
inventory  net of reserves  decreased by  to million at september  compared with million at september  this decrease was the result of the impairment charge for the safety catheter segment which included a write down of inventory of  inventory turns for fiscal increased to times from times in fiscal primarily because of the impairment charge for the safety catheter segment 
excluding the safety catheter segment  inventory would have turned times in fiscal compared to times in fiscal we expect inventory levels in fiscal to be similar to fiscal year end levels 
our deferred income tax asset increased during fiscal to  from  primarily due to the impairment charge for the safety catheter segment  which was not deductible for tax purposes in fiscal  and an increase in deferred incentive compensation 
prepaid expenses decreased to  during fiscal from  at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of the receipt during fiscal of a fiscal income tax refund 
net property and equipment decreased by during fiscal the change resulted from the combination of the impairment charge for the safety catheter segment  which included an impairment charge for machinery and equipment of million  and regular depreciation expense offset by equipment purchases of million 
we expect capital expenditures in fiscal to be slightly less than those of fiscal other assets decreased by to million during fiscal compared with million at fiscal year end due to the impairment of patents of  associated with the safety catheter segment 
our trade accounts payable decreased in fiscal to million 
accrued and sundry liabilities increased by during the year to million compared with million last year 
the increase was mostly due to higher accruals for incentive compensation and income tax payable 
during fiscal  we entered into a million revolving credit agreement with a bank to partially fund the per share special dividend paid on june  and other corporate needs 
we initially borrowed million to fund the dividend 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we repaid million  leaving a balance at fiscal year end of million 
the maximum principal amount we can borrow at any one time under the agreement is million 
the maturity date is june  the agreement is unsecured and accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our leverage ratio as defined in the agreement 
the margin in effect during fiscal was basis points 
the interest rate  including the margin  at september  was 
interest only payments are required monthly 
the agreement includes financial covenants relating to tangible net worth and leverage ratios 
the agreement restricts dividends  stock repurchases  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  indebtedness  liens  and capital expenditures 
violation of loan covenants could result in acceleration of the term of the agreement 
we have pledged to grant the bank a security interest in our accounts  instruments  and chattel paper upon its request in the event of a default as defined in the agreement 
we believe that we were in compliance with these covenants as of september the credit facility restricts dividends and stock repurchases during any fiscal year to an aggregate amount of no more than of the sum of i our income from continuing operations for that fiscal year plus ii the absolute value of any aggregate after tax  non cash and extraordinary losses for that fiscal year 
we may pay a regular quarterly dividend in an amount no greater than the previous quarter s regular dividend so long as we remain in compliance with the financial covenants after giving effect to the payment of the dividend as an exception to the restriction above 
we believe that funds on hand  funds generated from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility are adequate to finance our operations and expected capital requirements during fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
for additional information regarding these obligations  see the referenced footnotes in the notes to financial statements under item below 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than more than dollars in thousands total year years years years revolving credit agreement purchase obligations note deferred compensation note total contractual obligations impact of inflation and cost of raw materials based on current conditions in the markets for our primary raw materials  we expect inflation to be a moderate factor for our operations in fiscal volatile oil prices resulting in additional increases in the cost of polyurethane foam or other raw materials could negatively affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these higher costs through sales price increases or other cost reduction efforts 
the cost of polyurethane foam  our primary raw material  is indirectly influenced by oil prices 
however  other market factors also affect foam prices  including supply availability of component chemicals  demand for related products from domestic and international manufacturers  competition among domestic suppliers  our purchase volumes and regulatory requirements 
consequently  it is difficult for us to accurately predict future changes in foam raw material costs 
critical accounting policies this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements which we prepare in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions also require the application of certain accounting policies  many of which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
any differences may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to the accounting policies which are more fully described in the notes to financial statements included in this report  we have identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken to set credit limits for all customers 
we regularly evaluate past due items in our accounts receivable listing and provide what we estimate to be adequate reserves for doubtful accounts 
customer economic conditions may change and increase the risk of non collectibility and may require additional provisions which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of september   our provision for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable  or  inventories we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimated forecast of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
as of september   our provision for excess and obsolete inventory represented approximately of total inventories  or  warranty obligations we warrant certain of our products for specific periods of time against manufacturing or performance defects 
we provide for the estimated future cost of warranty obligations in cost of goods sold when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty cost represents our best estimate at the time of sale of the total cost that we will incur to repair or replace covered products or parts 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty cost is primarily based on historical experience as well as current information on repair costs 
actual warranty cost could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
our actual warranty expense was approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal see notes and in the notes to financial statements for more information on product warranties 
impairment of goodwill as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate goodwill in our medical business unit for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of our medical business unit 
for fiscal year end  we determined that the fair value of the medical business unit exceeded its carrying value and thus no impairment charge was required 
in assessing the value of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the medical business unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which would negatively impact operating results 
as of september   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
impairment of long lived assets impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of a long lived asset or asset group is greater than its fair value 
as required by sfas no 
 we evaluate long lived assets for potential impairment whenever events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and is greater than its fair value  the asset is impaired and an impairment loss must be recognized 
accordingly we recorded an impairment charge of million in september of which eliminates of the book value of the safety catheter assets  and management has begun efforts to sell this part of the business 
proceeds from a future sale of these assets  if any  will be recorded as income from discontinued operations 
see notes and in the notes to financial statements 
present value of deferred compensation we are obligated to make fixed payments under a retirement agreement over the remaining life of span america s founder as discussed in note deferred compensation in the notes to financial statements 
this obligation can be funded from internally generated cash or from the cash value of company owned life insurance policies  which had a value of million at september  see item a below and notes and in the notes to financial statements for more information on deferred compensation and the cash value of life insurance 
we have fully accrued the present value of the expected payments due over the executive s estimated life expectancy 
in calculating this present value we estimated an effective long term interest rate of 
if actual long term interest rates declined significantly and we were required to accrue additional deferred compensation costs in the future  it would negatively affect operating results 
as of september   we had recorded a deferred compensation liability of approximately  including current and long term portions 
if we reduced the discount rate by  the deferred compensation liability would be increased by approximately  and pre tax income would be reduced by the same amount 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk because our other assets at september  included million in cash value of life insurance  which is subject to market risk related to equity pricing and interest rate changes 
the cash value is generated from life insurance policies which are being used as the funding vehicle for a retirement program for span america s founder and former chairman 
see present value of deferred compensation above 
the cash value is invested in a combination of fixed income life insurance contracts and a portfolio of mutual funds managed by an insurance company 
the fixed income contracts are similar to fixed income bond funds and are therefore subject to interest rate and company risk 
the mutual fund portfolios invest in common stocks and bonds in accordance with their individual investment objectives 
these portfolios are exposed to stock market and interest rate risk similar to comparable mutual funds 
we believe that substantial fluctuations in equity markets and interest rates and the resulting changes in cash value of life insurance would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash value of life insurance increased by  creating after tax income of approximately  our credit facility accrues interest at a variable rate equal to day libor plus a margin ranging from to basis points depending on our then applicable leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the current margin is basis points 
interest is payable monthly 
an increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our financial condition and earnings to the extent that we had outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the degree of impact would vary depending on the level of the borrowings 
using our level of long term debt at september  of million  and assuming a constant level of debt for the entire year  a basis point increase in the interest rate on the outstanding loan balance would increase our interest expense by approximately  per year
