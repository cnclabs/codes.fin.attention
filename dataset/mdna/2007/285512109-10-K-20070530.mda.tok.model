item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following overview is a top level discussion of our operating results as well as some of the trends and drivers that affect our business 
management believes that an understanding of these trends and drivers is important in order to understand our results for the fiscal year ended march   as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this form k  including in the business section and the risk factors above  the remainder of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  or the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
about electronic arts we develop  market  publish and distribute interactive software games that are playable by consumers on video game consoles such as the sony playstation and playstation  microsoft xbox and nintendo wii  personal computers  mobile platforms including cellular handsets and handheld game players such as the playstation portable psp and the nintendo ds and online over the internet and other proprietary online networks 
some of our games are based on content that we license from others eg  madden nfl football  the godfather and fifa soccer  and some of our games are based on our own wholly owned intellectual property eg  the sims and need for speed 
our goal is to publish titles with mass market appeal  which often means translating and localizing them for sale in non english speaking countries 
in addition  we also attempt to create software game franchises that allow us to publish new titles on a recurring basis that are based on the same property 
examples of this franchise approach are the annual iterations of our sports based products eg  madden nfl football  ncaa football and fifa soccer  wholly owned properties that can be successfully sequeled eg  the sims  need for speed and battlefield and titles based on long lived literary and or movie properties eg  lord of the rings and harry potter 
overview of financial results total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was billion  up percent as compared to the fiscal year ended march  total net revenue for the fiscal year ended march  was driven by sales of madden nfl  need for speed carbon  fifa  the sims pets  and ncaa football four titles sold more than five million units in the fiscal year ended march  madden nfl  need for speed carbon  fifa  and the sims pets 
net income for the fiscal year ended march  was million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  diluted net income per share for the fiscal year ended march  was as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  although net revenue increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  net income decreased due to an increase in our operating expenses as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
revised sfas no 
r  share based payment  an increase in our annual bonus expense and an increase in additional personnel related costs due to an increase in headcount 
these increases were further mitigated by a decrease in our income tax provision 
we generated million of cash from operating activities during the year ended march   as compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash generated from operating activities was primarily due to the timing of the collection of our receivables as a result of collecting a greater amount of our receivables during fiscal as compared to fiscal stock based compensation 
beginning in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r which requires us to recognize the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions in our financial statements using a fair value based method

management s overview of historical and prospective business trends transition to a new generation of consoles 
video game hardware systems have historically had a life cycle of four to six years  which causes the video game software market to be cyclical as well 
microsoft launched the xbox in november  while sony and nintendo launched the playstation and the wii  respectively  in november we have continued to develop and market new titles for prior generation video game systems such as the playstation while also making significant investments in products for the new systems 
as the prior generation systems reach the end of their life cycle and the installed base of the new systems continues to grow  our sales of video games for prior generation systems will continue to decline as we produce fewer titles for prior generation systems  consumers replace their prior generation systems with the new systems  and or consumers reduce game software purchases for certain prior generation consoles generally  for example  until they are able to purchase a new video game hardware system 
this decline in prior generation product sales could ultimately be greater than we anticipate  and sales of products for the new platforms may be lower than we anticipate 
moreover  we expect development costs for the new video game systems to be greater on a per title basis than development costs for prior generation video game systems 
we have incurred increased costs during this transition as we have continued to develop and market new titles for certain prior generation video game platforms while also making significant investments in products for the new generation platforms 
as we move through the life cycle of prior generation consoles  we will continue to devote significant resources to the development of prior generation titles while at the same time spending more for the new generation of platforms and technology 
as a result of these factors  we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal investment in online 
today  we generate net revenue from a variety of online products and services  including casual games and downloadable content marketed under our pogo brand  persistent state world games such as ultima online and dark age of camelot  pc based downloadable content and online enabled packaged goods 
as the nature of online game offerings expands and evolves  we anticipate long term opportunities for growth in this area 
for example  we expect that consumers will take advantage of the online connectivity of the new generation of consoles at a much higher rate than they have on prior generation consoles  allowing more consumers to enhance their gameplay experience through multiplayer activity  community building and downloading content 
we plan to increase the amount of content available for download on the pc  consoles and cell phones  increase the number of games with dynamic in game advertising and to increase the number of pc based games that can be downloaded digitally 
in addition  we plan to expand our casual game offerings internationally and to invest in growing genres such as mid session 
table of contents games 
to further enhance our online offerings  we acquired mythic  a developer and publisher of massively multiplayer online role playing games  in july we intend to make significant investments in online products  infrastructure and services and believe that online gameplay will become an increasingly important part of our business in the long term 
significantly increased deferred revenue for online enabled games 
the ubiquity of high speed internet access and the integration of network connectivity into new generation game consoles are expected to increase demand for games with online enabled features 
to address this demand  many of our software products are developed with the ability to be connected to and played via the internet 
in order for consumers to participate in online communities and play against one another via the internet  we or through outsourced arrangements with third parties have servers which support the various online services we provide to consumers such as matchmaking  roster updates  tournaments and player rankings 
in situations where we do not separately sell these online services  we consider the sale of the software product as a bundle sale or multiple element arrangement in which we sell both the software product and the online service for one combined price 
through fiscal  for accounting purposes  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value existed for the online service 
accordingly  we allocated the revenue collected from the sale of the software product between the online service and the software product and recognized the amounts allocated to each element separately 
however  starting in fiscal  for accounting purposes  the required vendor specific objective evidence of fair value will not exist for the online services 
this will prevent us from allocating and recognizing revenue related to the software product and the online services separately 
accordingly  we will begin to recognize all of the revenue from the sale of our online enabled software products related to the pc  playstation  playstation and the psp platforms over the estimated online service period currently expected to be recognized over six months after the month of sale 
we anticipate that  in fiscal  we will likely defer approximately to million in net revenue from the sale of these online enabled software products into fiscal on a quarterly basis  this amount will vary significantly depending upon the timing of the release of the online enabled software product and the sales volume of such products 
in addition  we will expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions when delivered 
as of march   deferred net revenue related to packaged goods and digital content ie  content delivered to the consumer via the internet including digital downloads and certain incremental content related to our core subscription services playable only online  which are types of micro transactions was million 
expansion of mobile platforms 
advances in mobile technology have resulted in a variety of new and evolving platforms for on the go interactive entertainment that appeal to a broader demographic of consumers 
our efforts to capitalize on the growth in mobile interactive entertainment are focused in two broad areas packaged goods games for handheld game systems and downloadable games for cellular handsets 
we have developed and published games for a variety of handheld platforms  including the nintendo game boy and game boy advance  for several years 
the introductions of the sony psp and the nintendo ds  with their enhanced graphics  deeper gameplay  and online functionality  provide a richer mobile gaming experience for consumers 
we expect sales of games for cellular handsets to continue to be an increasingly important part of our business worldwide 
to accelerate our position in this growing segment  in february  we acquired jamdat mobile inc  a global publisher of wireless games and other wireless entertainment applications 
as a result of this acquisition  our net revenue from games for cellular handsets increased significantly in fiscal as compared to prior years 
likewise  the acquisition  along with the additional investment required to grow this portion of our business globally  resulted in increased license royalties  development and operating expenses in fiscal as mobile technology continues to evolve and the installed base of both handheld game systems and game enabled cellular phones continues to expand  we anticipate that sales of our titles for mobile platforms for both handhelds and cellular handsets will become an increasingly important part of our business 
acquisitions  investments and strategic transactions 
we have engaged in  evaluated  and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions  including acquisitions of 
table of contents companies  businesses  intellectual properties  and other assets  and investments in new interactive entertainment businesses  such as online and mobile games 
in may  we announced that we entered into a licensing agreement with and expect to make a strategic equity investment in the limited  a leading online game operator in china  on or around may  the licensing agreement gives the exclusive publishing rights for ea sports fifa online in mainland china 
in april  we expanded our commercial agreements with and made strategic equity investments in neowiz corporation and its online gaming subsidiary  neowiz games 
based in korea  neowiz is an online media and gaming company with which we partnered in to launch ea sports fifa online in korea 
in october  the remaining outstanding shares of digital illusions ce dice were purchased  thereby completing the acquisition of the remaining minority interest of dice 
in july  we acquired mythic as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in the massively multiplayer online role playing market 
in fiscal  we also acquired singshot media  a san francisco based online karaoke community  as well as substantially all of the assets of headgate studios  a utah based developer with which we had partnered since to develop certain ea franchises  and phenomic game development  a developer of real time strategy games based in germany 
in fiscal  we acquired jamdat as part of our efforts to accelerate our growth in mobile gaming 
international expansion 
we expect international sales to remain a fundamental part of our business 
as part of our international expansion strategy  we may seek to partner with established local companies through acquisitions  joint ventures  minority investments or other similar arrangements 
we are planning to expand our development and business activities internationally 
we believe that in order to succeed internationally  it is important to locally develop content that is specifically directed toward local cultures and consumers 
as such  we expect to continue to devote resources to hiring local development talent and expanding our infrastructure 
sales of hit titles 
sales of hit titles  several of which were top sellers in a number of countries  contributed significantly to our net revenue in fiscal our top selling titles across all platforms worldwide during the year ended march  were madden nfl  need for speed carbon  fifa  the sims pets and ncaa football hit titles are important to our financial performance because they benefit from overall economies of scale 
we have developed  and it is our objective to continue to develop  many of our hit titles to become franchise titles that can be regularly iterated 
increasing licensing costs 
we generate a significant portion of our net revenue and operating income from games based on licensed content  such as fifa soccer 
we have recently entered into new licenses and renewed older licenses  some of which may contain higher royalty rates or guarantees than similar license agreements we have entered into in the past 
we believe these licenses  and the product franchises they support  will continue to be important to our future operations  but the higher costs of these licenses will negatively impact our gross margins 
foreign currency exchange impact 
net revenue from international sales accounted for approximately percent of our total net revenue during both fiscal and our international net revenue was primarily driven by sales in europe and  to a much lesser extent  in asia 
year over year  foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact on our net revenue of million  or percent  for the year ended march  critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition  sales returns  allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  xbox and wii  pcs and mobile platforms including handheld game players such as the sony psp  nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets 
we evaluate the recognition of revenue based on the criteria set forth in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we evaluate revenue recognition using the following basic criteria and recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met evidence of an arrangement 
evidence of an agreement with the customer that reflects the terms and conditions to deliver products must be present in order to recognize revenue 
delivery 
delivery is considered to occur when a product is shipped and the risk of loss and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer 
for online game services  delivery is considered to occur as the service is provided 
fixed or determinable fee 
if a portion of the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as the amount becomes fixed or determinable 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review of each customer involved in a significant transaction to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect the customer to be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as those amounts become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we recognize revenue when collection becomes probable generally upon cash collection 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements  we must make assumptions and judgments in order to determine whether and when each element has been delivered  determine whether undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  determine whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for each undelivered element  and allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver 
changes to any of these assumptions or judgments  or changes to the elements in a software arrangement  could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
for example  some of our packaged goods products are sold with online services 
prior to  and through fiscal  we had been able to determine vsoe for the online services to be delivered  therefore  we have been able to allocate the total price received from the combined product and online service sale between these two elements and recognize the related revenue separately 
however  starting in fiscal  vsoe will not exist for the online services to be delivered for certain platforms and all revenue from these transactions will be recognized over the estimated online service period 
more specifically  we will begin to recognize the revenue from sales of certain online enabled packaged goods on a straight line basis over six months after the month of sale 
accordingly  this relatively small change from having vsoe for online hosting services to no longer having vsoe will have a significant effect on our reported results 
determining whether a transaction constitutes an online game service transaction or a download of a product requires judgment and can be difficult 
the accounting for these transactions is significantly different 
revenue from product downloads is recognized when the download occurs assuming all other recognition criteria are met 
revenue from online game services is recognized as the services are rendered 
if the service period is not defined  we recognize the revenue over the estimated service period 
determining the estimated service period is inherently subjective and is subject to regular revision based on historical online usage 
product revenue  including sales to resellers and distributors channel partners  is recognized when the above criteria are met 
we reduce product revenue for estimated future returns  price protection  and other offerings  which may occur with our customers and channel partners 
in certain countries  we have stock balancing programs for our pc and video game system products  which allow for the exchange of these 
table of contents products by resellers under certain circumstances 
it is our general practice to exchange products or give credits rather than to give cash refunds 
in certain countries  from time to time  we decide to provide price protection for both our pc and video game system products 
when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and price protection allowances  we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in retail and the video game segment  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  and other related factors 
in addition  we monitor the volume of sales to our channel partners and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel could result in high returns or higher price protection costs in subsequent periods 
in the future  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns and or price protection for our products may continue to increase as the playstation console moves through its lifecycle 
while we believe we can make reliable estimates regarding these matters  these estimates are inherently subjective 
accordingly  if our estimates changed  our returns and price protection reserves would change  which would impact the total net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  our actual results would decrease our reported total net revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and or price protection were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported total net revenue 
significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends and historical experience 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense and cash collection could change significantly 
royalties and licenses our royalty expenses consist of payments to content licensors  independent software developers  and co publishing and distribution affiliates 
license royalties consist of payments made to celebrities  professional sports organizations  movie studios and other organizations for our use of their trademarks  copyrights  personal publicity rights  content and or other intellectual property 
royalty payments to independent software developers are payments for the development of intellectual property related to our games 
co publishing and distribution royalties are payments made to third parties for the delivery of product 
royalty based obligations with content licensors and distribution affiliates are either paid in advance and capitalized as prepaid royalties or are accrued as incurred and subsequently paid 
these royalty based obligations are generally expensed to cost of goods sold generally at the greater of the contractual rate or an effective royalty rate based on expected net product sales 
significant judgment is required to estimate the effective royalty rate for a particular contract 
because the computation of effective royalty rates requires us to project future revenue  it is inherently subjective as our future revenue projections must anticipate a number of factors  including the total number of titles subject to the contract  the timing of the release of these titles  the number of software units we expect to sell which can be impacted by a number of variables  including product quality and competition  and future pricing 
determining the effective royalty rate for our titles is particularly challenging due to the inherent difficulty in predicting the popularity of entertainment products 
accordingly  if our future revenue projections change  our effective royalty rates would change  which could impact the royalty expense we recognize 
prepayments made to thinly capitalized independent software developers and co publishing affiliates are generally made in connection with the development of a particular product and  therefore  we are generally subject to development risk prior to the release of the product 
accordingly  payments that are due prior to completion of a product are generally amortized to research and development over the development period as the services are incurred 
payments due after completion of the product primarily royalty based in nature are generally expensed as cost of goods sold 

table of contents our contracts with some licensors include minimum guaranteed royalty payments which are initially recorded as an asset and as a liability at the contractual amount when no performance remains with the licensor 
when performance remains with the licensor  we record guarantee payments as an asset when actually paid and as a liability when incurred  rather than recording the asset and liability upon execution of the contract 
minimum royalty payment obligations are classified as current liabilities to the extent such royalty payments are contractually due within the next twelve months 
as of march  and  approximately million of minimum guaranteed royalty obligations had been recognized in each period 
each quarter  we also evaluate the future realization of our royalty based assets as well as any unrecognized minimum commitments not yet paid to determine amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments determined before the launch of a product are charged to research and development expense 
impairments determined post launch are charged to cost of goods sold 
in either case  we rely on estimated revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties and commitments 
if actual sales or revised revenue estimates fall below the initial revenue estimate  then the actual charge taken may be greater in any given quarter than anticipated 
we had no impairments during fiscal during fiscal and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in value exists 
this evaluation requires us to estimate  among other things  the remaining useful lives of the assets and future cash flows of the business 
these evaluations and estimates require the use of judgment 
our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 
under current accounting standards  we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
in order to determine if a potential impairment has occurred  management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game consoles  handheld game players  pcs  and cellular handsets platforms 
the sales of our products are affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
due to product sales shortfalls  we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets  which may result in an impairment charge being recorded in the future 
we recognized an insignificant amount of impairment in fiscal  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires at least an annual assessment for impairment of goodwill by applying a fair value based test 
a two step approach is required to test goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
the first step tests for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology which requires significant judgment to estimate the future cash flows  determine the appropriate discount rates  growth rates and other assumptions 
the determination of fair value for each reporting unit could be materially affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions which could trigger impairment 
in fiscal  we completed the first step of the annual goodwill impairment testing as of january  and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill 
we did not recognize an impairment loss on goodwill in fiscal  or future impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with the annual impairment test 

table of contents stock based compensation on april   we adopted sfas no 
r and applied the provisions of sab no 
 share based payment  on our adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements using a fair value based method 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method of adoption 
sfas no 
r requires us to measure compensation cost for all outstanding unvested stock based awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
we recognized million of stock based compensation related to employee stock options  restricted stock units  restricted stock awards and our employee stock purchase plan espp during the fiscal year ended march  we recognized million of stock based compensation related to employee restricted stock units  stock options assumed in connection with our acquisition of jamdat and non employee stock options during the fiscal year ended march  we recognized million of stock based compensation related to stock options assumed in connection with our acquisition of criterion software group ltd 
and non employee stock options and warrants during the fiscal year ended march  for options and espp  we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the grant date fair value 
the black scholes option valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions about the future 
the determination of fair value is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding subjective and complex variables such as expected employee exercise behavior and our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award 
generally  our assumptions are based on historical information and judgment is required to determine if historical trends may be indicators of future outcomes 
we estimated the following key assumptions for the black scholes valuation calculation risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected volatility 
we use our historical stock price volatility and consider the implied volatility computed based on the price of short term options publicly traded on our common stock for our expected volatility assumption 
expected term 
the expected term represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term is determined based on historical exercise behavior  post vesting termination patterns  options outstanding and future expected exercise behavior 
expected dividends 
as required by sfas no 
r  employee stock based compensation expense recognized in fiscal was calculated based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates and an adjustment will be recognized at that time 
changes to our underlying stock price  our assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation calculation and our forfeiture rate as well as future grants of equity could significantly impact compensation expense to be recognized in fiscal and future periods 
income taxes in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the tax law and ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate prior to the completion and filing of tax returns for such periods 
this process requires estimating both our geographic mix of income and our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction where we operate 
these estimates involve complex issues  require extended periods of time to resolve  and require us to make judgments  such as anticipating the positions that we will take on tax returns prior to our actually preparing the returns and the outcomes of disputes with tax authorities 
we are also required to make determinations of the need to record deferred tax liabilities and the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is 
table of contents established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
in addition  changes in our business  including acquisitions  changes in our international corporate structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix and amount of income  as well as changes in our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters  and variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate 
as with fiscal  we expect our effective tax rate to be unusually volatile and subject to significant fluctuation

comparison of fiscal to fiscal net revenue we derive net revenue principally from sales of interactive software games designed for play on video game consoles such as the playstation  playstation  xbox and wii  pcs and handheld game players such as the sony psp  nintendo ds and nintendo game boy advance and cellular handsets 
we also derive net revenue from selling services in connection with some of our online games  programming third party web 
table of contents sites with our game content  allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products  and selling advertisements on our online web pages and in our games 
from a geographical perspective  our total net revenue for fiscal years ended march  and was as follows in millions year ended march  increase decrease change north america europe asia international total net revenue north america for fiscal  net revenue in north america was  million  driven primarily by our packaged goods business led by sales of madden nfl  need for speed carbon  and ncaa football  and to a lesser extent  growth in our cellular handset games business resulting from our february acquisition of jamdat 
overall  net revenue increased million  or percent  as compared to fiscal the increase in net revenue for fiscal  as compared to fiscal was driven primarily by a million increase in cellular handset net revenue  and a million increase in catalog a net revenue 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in frontline b net revenue 
a we refer to catalog net revenue as net revenue derived from an ea studio sku a version of a title designed for play on a particular platform for consoles  pc  psp  nintendo ds  and game boy advance subsequent to the fiscal period presented in which the sku was initially launched

cost of goods sold for fiscal years and were as follows in millions change as a march  of net march  of net of net revenue revenue change revenue in fiscal  cost of goods sold decreased by percentage points as a percentage of total net revenue as compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to lower average product costs as a percentage of total net revenue primarily driven by fewer returns and lower pricing actions taken  or expected to be taken  in fiscal as compared to fiscal and improved inventory management 
as a result  we estimate average product costs as a percentage of total net revenue decreased by approximately percent in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a percentage of total net revenue  the decrease in average product costs was partially offset by an estimated percent increase in license royalties during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to license agreements associated with our ea sports titles and from our acquisition of jamdat 
this was partially offset by lower license royalties from movie based titles in fiscal although there can be no assurance  and our actual results could differ materially  in the short term we expect our gross margin to decline as a result of increased deferred net revenue related to certain online enabled packaged goods we will expense the cost of goods sold related to these transactions when delivered  a higher mix of co publishing and distribution net revenue that has a lower gross margin  and higher license royalty rates

income taxes income taxes for fiscal years and were as follows in millions march  effective march  effective tax rate tax rate change our effective income tax rates were percent and percent for fiscal and fiscal  respectively

r and additional charges resulting from certain non deductible acquisition related costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal for fiscal  our effective income tax rate is higher than the us statutory rate of percent for fiscal due to a number of factors  including the repatriation of foreign earnings in connection with the american jobs creation act of the jobs act  as discussed below  and additional charges resulting from certain non deductible acquisition related costs during the second and fourth quarters of fiscal  which were partially offset by other items 
our effective income tax rates for fiscal and future periods will depend on a variety of factors 
for example  changes in our business such as acquisitions and intercompany transactions for example  the acquisition of and intercompany transactions related to mythic and dice  changes in our international structure  changes in the geographic location of business functions or assets  changes in the geographic mix of income  as well as changes in  or termination of  our agreements with tax authorities  valuation allowances  applicable accounting rules  applicable tax laws and regulations  rulings and interpretations thereof  developments in tax audit and other matters 
also  variations in the estimated and actual level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective income tax rate for future fiscal years 
we incur certain tax expenses that do not decline proportionately with declines in our consolidated income or increase in consolidated loss 
as a result  in absolute dollar terms  our tax expense will have a greater influence on our effective tax rate at lower levels of pre tax income than higher levels 
in addition  at lower levels of pre tax income  our effective tax rate will be more volatile 
we historically have considered undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no us taxes have been provided thereon 
with the exception of taking advantage of the one time opportunity afforded to us by the jobs act  we currently intend to continue to indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
it also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement should not be applied retrospectively to fiscal years 
table of contents beginning prior to the effective date  except as permitted with early adoption 
we are evaluating if we will adopt sfas no 
and what impact the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements if we adopt 
if we adopt sfas no 
 it may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf issued a tentative conclusion on eitf  accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development and the fasb ratified the tentative conclusion 
the fasb exposed the eitf tentative conclusion for public comment 
the comment period was expected to end in may eitf addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under this tentative conclusion  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if a final consensus is reached on this tentative conclusion  eitf would be effective for interim or annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if ratified by the fasb as currently proposed

our primary use of cash in non operating activities consisted of  million used to purchase short term investments  million in capital expenditures primarily related to investments in our worldwide development tools  technologies and equipment and expansions of our vancouver and united kingdom studios  as well as million primarily for the acquisitions of mythic and the remaining minority interest in dice 
during fiscal  we anticipate making continued capital investments in our studios  investments in the new generation of consoles  online infrastructure and mobile platforms 
in addition  
table of contents we have engaged in  evaluated  and expect to continue to engage in and evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions 
in april  we expanded our commercial agreements with and made strategic equity investments in neowiz corporation and its online gaming subsidiary  neowiz games 
we purchased stock representing in aggregate approximately percent of each of neowiz and neowiz games for approximately million 
based in korea  neowiz is an online media and gaming company with which we partnered in to launch ea sports fifa online in korea 
short term investments and marketable equity securities due to our mix of fixed and variable rate securities  our short term investment portfolio is susceptible to changes in short term interest rates 
as of march   our short term investments had gross unrealized gains of million  or less than percent of the total in short term investments  and gross unrealized losses of approximately million  or less than percent of the total in short term investments 
from time to time  we may liquidate some or all of our short term investments to fund operational needs or other activities  such as capital expenditures  business acquisitions or stock repurchase programs 
depending on which short term investments we liquidate to fund these activities  we could recognize a portion  or all  of the gross unrealized gains or losses 
marketable equity securities increased to million as of march   from million as of march   due to an increase in the fair value of our investment in ubisoft entertainment 
receivables  net our gross accounts receivable balances were million and million as of march  and  respectively 
the increase in our accounts receivable balance was primarily due to a higher percentage of net revenue recognized in the last month of our fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal reserves for sales returns  pricing allowances and doubtful accounts decreased in absolute dollars from million as of march  to million as of march  as a percentage of trailing nine month net revenue  reserves decreased from percent as of march   to percent as of march  we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns  pricing allowances and doubtful accounts 
inventories inventories increased slightly to million as of march  from million as of march  other than need for speed carbon  no single title represented more than million of inventory as of march  other current assets other current assets decreased to million as of march   from million as of march   primarily due to the timing of the collection of advertising credits owed to us by our vendors that were earned in fiscal  partially offset by an increase in value added taxes receivable 
accounts payable accounts payable increased to million as of march   from million as of march   primarily due to higher inventory purchases to support our business in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal accrued and other current liabilities our accrued and other liabilities increased to million as of march  from million as of march  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in accrued compensation and benefits and million in income taxes payable 

table of contents deferred income taxes  net our long term position of deferred income taxes changed by million  from a liability position as of march  to a net asset position as of march  primarily due to the addition of assets related to our adoption of sfas no 
r and the reduction of liabilities due to the amortization of purchased intangibles 
financial condition we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  marketable equity securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
we may choose at any time to raise additional capital to strengthen our financial position  facilitate expansion  pursue strategic acquisitions and investments or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise 
there can be no assurance  however  that such additional capital will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all  or that it will not result in substantial dilution to our existing stockholders 
the loan financing arrangements supporting our redwood city headquarters leases with keybank national association  described in the off balance sheet commitments section below  are scheduled to expire in july upon expiration of the financing  we may request  on behalf of the lessor and subject to lender approval  an additional one year extension of the loan financing between the lessor and the lenders 
in the event the lessor s loan financing with the lenders is not extended  we may loan to the lessor approximately percent of the financing  and require the lessor to extend the remainder through july  otherwise the leases will terminate

as of march   approximately  million of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and marketable equity securities that was generated from operations was domiciled in foreign tax jurisdictions 
while we have no plans to repatriate these funds to the united states in the short term  if we choose to do so  we would accrue and pay additional taxes on any portion of the repatriation where no united states income tax had been previously provided 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we repatriated million of foreign earnings in fiscal under the jobs act 
we completed the repatriation in fiscal which resulted in a tax expense of million 
we have a shelf registration statement on form s on file with the sec 
this shelf registration statement  which includes a base prospectus  allows us at any time to offer any combination of securities described in the prospectus in one or more offerings up to a total amount of billion

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and market prices 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and market prices 
we employ established policies and practices to manage these risks 
foreign exchange option and forward contracts are used to hedge anticipated exposures or mitigate some existing exposures subject to foreign exchange risk as discussed below 
we have not historically  nor do we currently  hedge our short term investment portfolio 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be exposed to significant interest rate risk because our cash and cash equivalent portfolio consists of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we also do not currently hedge our market price risk relating to our equity investments 
further  we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
foreign currency exchange rate risk cash flow hedging activities 
from time to time  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency risk related to forecasted foreign currency denominated sales and expense transactions by purchasing option contracts that generally have maturities of months or less 
these transactions are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the derivative assets associated with our hedging activities are recorded at fair value in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
the effective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value of these hedges is initially reported  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive 
table of contents income in stockholders equity and subsequently reclassified into net revenue or operating expenses  as appropriate in the period when the forecasted transaction is recorded 
the ineffective portion of gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value  if any  is reported in each period in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements in revenue and operating expenses 
as of march   we had foreign currency option contracts to purchase approximately million in foreign currencies and to sell approximately million of foreign currencies 
as of march   these foreign currency option contracts outstanding had a total fair value of less than million  included in other current assets 
as of march   we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 
balance sheet hedging activities 
we utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency risk associated with foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  primarily intercompany receivables and payables 
the forward contracts generally have a contractual term of approximately one month and are transacted near month end 
therefore  the fair value of the forward contracts generally is not significant at each month end 
our foreign exchange forward contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under sfas no 
and are accounted for as derivatives whereby the fair value of the contracts are reported as other current assets or other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  and gains and losses from changes in fair value are reported in interest and other income  net 
the gains and losses on these forward contracts generally offset the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  which are also reported in interest and other income  net  in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of march   we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 
as of march   we had forward foreign exchange contracts to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies 
of this amount  million represented contracts to sell foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars  million to sell foreign currencies in exchange for british pound sterling and million to purchase foreign currencies in exchange for us dollars 
the fair value of our forward contracts was immaterial as of march  and march  the counterparties to these forward and option contracts are creditworthy multinational commercial banks  therefore  the risk of counterparty nonperformance is not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exchange rate risks  there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
as of march   a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would result in a potential loss in fair value of our option contracts of million in both scenarios 
as of march   we had no foreign currency option contracts outstanding 
a hypothetical adverse foreign currency exchange rate movement of percent or percent would result in potential losses on our forward contracts of million and million  respectively  as of march   and million and million  respectively  as of march  this sensitivity analysis assumes a parallel adverse shift in foreign currency exchange rates  which do not always move in the same direction 
actual results may differ materially 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short maturities 
additionally  the contractual terms of the securities do not permit the issuer to call  prepay or otherwise settle the securities at prices less than the stated par value of the securities 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading 
also  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
as of march  and  our short term investments were classified as available for sale and  consequently  recorded at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses resulting from changes in fair value reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of any tax effects  in 
table of contents stockholders equity 
our portfolio of short term investments consisted of the following investment categories  summarized by fair value as of march  and in millions as of march  commercial paper us agency securities corporate bonds asset backed securities us treasury securities total short term investments notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations
