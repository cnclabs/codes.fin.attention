item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
all dollar and share amounts are presented in thousands  except per share amounts overview we provide voice and data communications products and services to consumers and businesses 
we provide these services throughout the united states in approximately metropolitan areas in states 
our telecommunications network allows us to offer services to more than million homes and businesses 
our products and services include high speed  or broadband  data communications  internet access connectivity  voice over internet protocol telephony  or voip  fixed wireless broadband  and a variety of related services 
we primarily use digital subscriber line  or dsl  and t technologies to deliver our services 
we also use fixed wireless broadband technology to deliver services in six of our metropolitan areas 
in order to provide our dsl and t services we purchase network elements  such as telecommunication lines and central office facilities  from the local telephone companies  which are often referred to as the incumbent local telephone companies  or ilecs  and other carriers  and then combine these network elements with our own nationwide facilities 
we purchase the majority of these network elements from verizon communications  or verizon  at t  inc which now includes the companies formerly known as sbc communications  or sbc  and bellsouth telecommunications  or bellsouth  or at t  and qwest corporation  or qwest  which are also known as the regional bell operating companies  or rbocs 
as of december   we had approximately  broadband access end users   voip business customers with a combined total of approximately  voip sites  and approximately  fixed wireless broadband customers in service 
we operate two business segments  wholesale and direct 
wholesale is a provider of high speed data and voice connectivity services to internet service providers  or isps  and telecommunications carrier customers 
we also offer line powered voice access service  or lpva  which enables a wholesale partner to combine analog voice service with our consumer grade data services 
as of december   wholesale had approximately  dsl and t lines in service 
the majority of our services are sold through our wholesale segment 
our direct segment sells voip  high speed data and voice connectivity  fixed wireless broadband  and related value added services 
our business grade voip services are sold exclusively through our direct segment 
we sell our direct services through multiple channels including telesales  field sales  affinity partner programs  and our website 
direct focuses on the small business market and also sells to enterprise customers that purchase our services for distribution across their enterprise 
direct ended with approximately  dsl and t lines in service 
in addition  direct provided service to approximately  voip business customers and approximately  fixed wireless broadband customers at the end of our business is subject to on going changes in telecommunications technologies  the competitive environment  particularly continued pricing pressure on our consumer grade services  federal and state telecommunications regulations  and our resellers changing market strategies 
sales of our stand alone dsl services have slowed  
table of contents and we continue to experience churn among our existing end users due to pricing pressures and other factors 
as a result of these market conditions  we have added or increased our focus on the following direct sales of bundled services  which includes voip and data communications services  to small and medium sized businesses  higher bandwidth services  like our t services  fixed wireless broadband services  and lpva service 
we believe there is a substantial business opportunity to grow our sales of these services 
while we believe we are favorably positioned to take advantage of this market opportunity  it is inherently difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty our ability to grow our sales of these services and whether our sales of these services will offset slowing sales of our stand alone dsl services 
we were originally incorporated in california as covad communications company in october in july  we were incorporated in delaware as covad communications group  inc  a holding company that conducts substantially all of its business through its operating wholly owned subsidiaries 
industry background dsl technology first emerged in the s and is commercially available today to address performance bottlenecks of the public switched telephone network 
dsl equipment  when deployed at each end of standard copper telephone lines  increases the data carrying capacity of copper telephone lines from analog modem speeds of up to kilobits per second  for the fastest consumer modems  and integrated services digital network  or isdn  speeds of up to kilobits per second to dsl speeds of up to megabits per second downstream and up to megabits per second upstream  depending on the length and condition of the copper line 
the passage of the telecommunications act created a legal framework for competitive telecommunications companies to provide local  analog and digital communications services in competition with the ilecs 
the telecommunications act allowed these competitive telecommunications companies to use certain parts of the existing infrastructure built by the ilecs rather than constructing a competing infrastructure at significant cost 
among other things  this infrastructure includes telephone lines and space in the ilecs central offices 
fixed broadband wireless service has also emerged as an alternative to wireline services 
fixed wireless differs from mobile wireless service because the location of the end user is fixed 
improvements in technology and wider acceptance of wireless services have reduced the cost to deploy fixed wireless services 
in addition  the development of the wimax standard is expected to facilitate broader deployments of these services 
our service offerings our service offerings can be grouped into two main categories  data and voice services 
we deliver these services through our broadband wireline and fixed wireless networks 
our direct customers can purchase our data services separately  while our voice services are typically offered in a bundle with our data services 
within our data suite of services  we offer a variety of business and consumer grade broadband access services  email and hosting services 
our business grade wireline data services are sold under the telespeed  telesoho and telextend brands for wireline services and under our nextweb brands for fixed wireless services 
our consumer grade wireline services are sold under the telesurfer brand 
in addition  resellers may purchase high capacity network backhaul services from us to connect their facilities to our network and to provide direct technical support for their end users 
our voice services are sold under the covad clearedge brand 
we also offer lpva  which enables a wholesale partner to combine analog voice service with our consumer grade data services 
the specific number of potential end users who qualify for dsl service varies by central office and by region and is affected by line quality  distance and type of telephone loop facility deployed in a particular area 
the specific number of potential end users who qualify for fixed wireless services depends on distance from a base station  geography such as to topology and the location of interfering buildings and trees and the availability and 
table of contents characteristics of the type of wireless spectrum being used 
prices for our end user services vary depending on the performance level of the service  the underlying technology used to deliver the service and our costs for offering a service 
our prices also vary for high volume customers that are eligible for volume discounts 
see part i  item a 
risk factors we may experience decreasing margins on the sale of our services  which may impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow for a discussion of some of the risks associated with our ability to sustain current price levels in the future 
telespeed we launched service in december with our telespeed services 
we provision telespeed services via symmetric download and upload speeds are equal dsl  or sdsl  and isdn dsl  or idsl  technologies 
these services are offered in a variety of speeds ranging from kilobits to megabits per second 
telespeed services are intended to connect individual end users on previously unused conventional telephone lines to our dsl equipment in their serving central office and from there to our network serving that metropolitan statistical area 
the particular telespeed service available to an end user depends in large part on the end user s distance to their respective central office 
telespeed services are offered with specific service levels of performance and repair times based on our service level agreements  or slas 
telesoho we introduced our telesoho service in september we designed telesoho for the small office home office  or soho  customer segment 
the service is asymmetric faster download than upload speeds  offering speeds up to megabits per second downstream and up to kilobits per second upstream  and can be delivered to customers using a self or professional installation 
telesoho is provisioned with an asymmetric dsl  or adsl  router capable of supporting multiple end users and can support one fixed internet protocol  or ip  address 
line sharing and self installations reduce the monthly recurring cost and the up front cost for installation of the service 
telesoho services provisioned over a shared line do not include service level agreements 
in july  we introduced second line telesoho services  which we provision over a dedicated line  instead of a shared line 
our second line telesoho services provide features and performance similar to our telesoho line shared services  but allow a customer to purchase this service without purchasing telephone service from the local telephone company 
in addition  our second line telesoho service includes service level commitments 
telextend we introduced our telextend services in november these services allow end users to connect to our network equipment in their local central offices over a t line 
the availability of telextend services is not limited by distance from the servicing central office and is accompanied with slas providing for our highest level of service 
telesurfer we introduced our telesurfer service in april telesurfer is designed for consumers 
this service is asymmetric  offering speeds up to megabits per second downstream and up to kilobits per second upstream and uses dynamic ip addressing 
we generally deliver this service to customers using a self installation kit over a line shared loop 
line sharing and self installations reduce the monthly recurring cost and the up front cost for installation of the service 
this service is not sold with slas 
in july  we introduced second line telesurfer services  which we provision over a dedicated telephone line 
our second line telesurfer services provide features and performance similar to the telesurfer line shared services  but allow a customer to purchase this service without purchasing telephone service from the local telephone company 

table of contents fixed broadband wireless as a result of our acquisitions of nextweb  inc  or nextweb  which we completed on february   and dataflo  inc  which we completed on november   we are currently offering business grade fixed broadband wireless services to customers in the san francisco bay area  los angeles  orange county california  santa barbara  las vegas and chicago 
this service is sold directly to end users 
we offer speeds of up to megabits per second downstream and upstream using unlicensed spectrum and up to megabits per second downstream and upstream using licensed spectrum  including spectrum leased from holders of fcc auctioned spectrum 
our fixed broadband wireless services are offered with specific service levels of performance and times for repairs based on our slas 
by offering fixed wireless broadband services  we expect that in the future we may be able to reduce our dependence on the ilecs for the network elements that we currently use to offer our services in the areas where we operate fixed wireless facilities 
we also expect our recurring costs for fixed wireless end users will be lower because in many cases we do not have to pay a monthly charge for a fixed wireless connection that is provisioned over our own network 
in many cases we also can install fixed wireless services more quickly than we can install services that rely on network elements that are purchased from the ilecs 
finally  in some cases fixed wireless allows us to offer higher speed services than we can currently offer over our wireline network 
voice over internet protocol for businesses in june  we completed our acquisition of gobeam  inc  or gobeam  and introduced our business class voip services to small and medium sized businesses 
these services enable customers to use ip and internet connections to make local and long distance telephone calls over covad s network instead of using the traditional public switched telephone network 
we sell three voip services  covad clearedge pro  covad clearedge integrated access and covad clearedge office 
covad clearedge pro is intended as a substitute for a small company s telephone private branch exchange  or pbx  system and includes call features such as find me  follow me  web conferencing  call forwarding  instant messaging and unified voicemail and fax services 
it is a hosted voice service  eliminating the need for on premise voice switching equipment 
for customers who want to keep their existing pbx system  covad clearedge integrated access has some of the same features as our covad clearedge pro service  but it works with an end user s existing pbx system to deliver local  long distance and internet services over one managed network connection  an alternative to using multiple connections 
we introduced covad clearedge office in for smaller businesses that want many of the call features of a pbx  but do not need all of the features and functionality offered by our covad clearedge pro service 
we believe that our covad clearedge pro and office services provide cost advantages over pbx based models because our customers do not need to purchase additional telephone line connections from other providers or install telephone switches at their premises 
customers of our covad clearedge pro and covad clearedge office services also can realize productivity improvements and reduce costs for in house technical personnel  who typically are required to install and maintain a pbx based telephone service 
while our voip services for businesses target a large market  we are continuing to enhance and expand our capability to market and sell these services through various channels 
as a result  we will also continue to further enhance the internal systems and processes to support these new services  channels and additional customers 
voice over internet protocol for consumers in january of  earthlink  inc  or earthlink  one of our wholesale customers  began offering a consumer grade voip service deployed over the telephone lines that we lease from the rbocs to provide data services 
we refer to the portion of this service we provide as lpva 
earthlink adds local and long distance voip and related services to our lpva service  as well as high speed internet access  using consumers existing wiring  telephone and computer equipment 
lpva service is intended to compete with the consumer voice and data bundles offered by the rbocs and the cable companies 
this service is offered as part of earthlink s voice and data bundle in twelve metropolitan areas 
in order to offer lpva service  we have deployed new digital subscriber line access multiplexers  or dslams in the rbocs central offices in these twelve major metropolitan areas 
if we decide to offer lpva service 
table of contents out of additional central offices  we will need to similarly deploy new equipment in those locations 
we do not currently intend to offer this service through our direct segment 
asynchronous transfer mode  or atm  network services we also provide ds and oc circuit backhaul services from our regional network to a reseller s site 
this service aggregates data traffic from individual end users in a region and transmits the packets of information to the reseller over a single high capacity connection 
the service utilizes atm protocol that operates at up to megabits per second for ds circuits and up to megabits per second for oc circuits 
broadband internet access service our broadband internet access service  or bia  allows our resellers to sell broadband to their end user customers without having to invest in network facilities 
this service currently bundles ip services with our high speed connectivity services to provide a complete connection to the internet 
the additional ip services include end user authentication  authorization and accounting  ip address assignment and management  domain name service and ip routing and connectivity 
value added services in addition to access and voice services  we offer value added services to our wholesale and direct customers who purchase services directly from us 
these services include email and web hosting these services allow small and medium sized businesses to have a custom domain name  for example www 
mybusiness 
com  as well as business class email and web hosting 
all services come with anti spam and anti virus protection and easy to use website building tools and templates 
installation services we offer professional installation services to our wholesale and direct customers in connection with our services 
in some cases our customer may request that we install additional equipment  services or software  such as a firewall or a virtual private network  for an additional fee 
sales and marketing wholesale we sell our broadband services to isps  telecommunications carriers and other resellers 
these resellers purchase our services on a wholesale basis and sell them under their own brand 
we had resellers as of december  for  our largest resellers collectively accounted for of our total wholesale net revenues and of our total net revenues 
for  at t and earthlink  two of our resellers  accounted for and  respectively  of our total net revenues 
as of december   approximately  end users purchased services through our resellers 
we offer our resellers a range of dsl  t and lpva services that they in turn offer to their business and consumer customers 
they can either combine our dsl and t lines with their own internet access services or purchase our bia services and resell the combination to their customers 
our agreements with our resellers generally have terms of one to three years and are non exclusive 
we generally do not require these resellers to generate a minimum number of end users or a minimum amount of revenue  but we grant volume discounts based on subscriber volume 
strategic resellers with established brand names help us deliver our services to a larger number of end users 
the cost of acquiring a customer for broadband services is significant  so leveraging the brand of our resellers  their customer bases  and embedded direct and indirect sales channels helps us reduce this cost 
we provide our resellers with sales and marketing support 
we work jointly with our resellers to develop and fund marketing programs that are specific to their target markets  product offerings and sales objectives 
we work to improve the cost of acquisition by assisting our resellers with direct marketing  promotions  and incentive programs 

table of contents direct we also sell our services directly and indirectly to end user customers 
we sell voip  high speed data and voice connectivity  fixed wireless broadband and related value added services directly through our direct sales force  telephone sales and web sales capabilities 
we also sell our services indirectly via a variety of third parties such as dealers  sales agents  referral partners and affinity groups 
our approach to this market is to combine our national network with other features to deliver services to small offices  home offices and small and medium sized businesses  as well as distributed enterprises 
as of december   we had approximately  broadband lines   voip business customers with a combined total of approximately  voip sites  and approximately  fixed wireless broadband customers in service under our covad brand 
our marketing programs and communications to small and medium sized businesses are primarily designed to increase brand awareness and encourage potential customers to contact our telesales center or visit our website 
we use national and local marketing campaigns 
we employ a wide variety of media  including on line advertisements  television  direct mail  radio and print 
our telesales and field sales teams also sell our services via outbound calling and feet on the street sales 
our telesales groups make outbound calls to individuals or organizations that have visited our website and to lists of pre qualified businesses that match the profile of customers who have purchased services from us in the past 
the field sales organization targets small businesses and also sells to enterprise customers that purchase our services for distribution across their enterprise  such as connecting remote offices back to their corporate headquarters 
our referral resources include sales agents  dealers and referral partners that receive one time or recurring commissions in exchange for referring customers to us 
in many cases  the sales agents  dealers and referral partners are telecommunications specialists that provide information technology  telecommunications  and networking services and products to business customers 
by being part of our alliance network  our partners are able to complement their existing services and provide our broadband and voip services to their customers 
network architecture and technology we designed our network to provide the following attributes  which we believe are important requirements for our existing and potential customers consistent and scalable performance we believe that packet networks will play an increasingly central role in the communications services market in the united states 
with this in mind  we designed our network for scalability and consistent performance as we add new users and services 
we have designed a nationwide network that is organized around our regional metropolitan areas and interconnected across the country 
it is likely that our continued growth and the increasing amount of bandwidth required by our customers for applications like voice and video streaming will require that we continue to upgrade our equipment and purchase additional network capacity 
intelligent end to end network management because customers lines are continuously connected  we have visibility from the isp or enterprise site across the network all the way down to the customer s line  and for certain high value customers  further down to their cpe 
because our network is centrally managed  we can identify and improve network quality  service and performance 
flexibility we have designed our network to be flexible in handling various types of network traffic  including data  voice  and potentially extending to video information in the future 
this flexibility will allow us to carry not only value added services such as voip  but will also allow us to control the prioritization of content delivery over our national network 
we accomplish the prioritization and quality of service control using atm technology  which allows us to support both non real time and real time applications and allocates bandwidth among customers 
network operations centers our entire network is managed from a network operations center located in the san francisco bay area 
we provide end to end network management using advanced network management tools on a x basis  which enhances our ability to address performance or connectivity issues 

table of contents nationwide broadband access and internet connectivity we link each of our metropolitan areas together with leased high speed private backbone network connections 
our internet access points are strategically located at high speed interconnection facilities across the country in order to increase the performance and decrease the latency of connections to the internet for our customers 
private metropolitan network we operate our own private metropolitan network in each region that we provide service 
the network consists of high speed communications circuits that we lease to connect our hubs  our equipment in individual central offices  our internet access points  and our resellers and direct customers with multiple locations 
we have leased fiber optic networks using synchronous optical network  or sonet  technology in four of our major metropolitan areas 
our metropolitan networks operate at speeds of megabits per second to gigabits per second 
central office spaces through our interconnection agreements with the ilecs  we lease space in central offices where we offer service 
we require access to these spaces for our equipment and for persons employed by or under contract with us 
we place dslams in our central office spaces to provide the high speed dsl signals on each copper line to our end users 
as of december   we had  operational central offices 
telephone lines we lease the telephone lines running to end users from the ilecs under terms specified in our interconnection agreements 
we lease lines that  in many cases  must be specially conditioned by the ilecs to carry digital signals  usually at an additional charge relative to that for voice grade telephone lines 
we also provide some of our services over telephone lines that already carry the voice service of an ilec  known as line sharing 
our continuing ability to use these line shared telephone lines is dependent on our ability to maintain and enter into agreements with the three largest ilecs  the rbocs  or to obtain favorable regulatory rulings 
fixed wireless connections we sell fixed wireless broadband services directly to end users in the san francisco bay area  los angeles  orange county california  santa barbara  chicago and las vegas 
we are evaluating whether we will offer the service in additional markets 
we offer this service using a combination of licensed and unlicensed wireless spectrum 
the advantage of using licensed spectrum is that it is easier to prevent interference from other providers 
much of the licensed spectrum we use today is licensed directly by the fcc on a point to point basis 
additionally  some licensed spectrum we use is leased from third party license holders 
for this reason  we incur additional operating expenses using licensed spectrum 
in contrast  unlicensed spectrum requires less operating expense  but the management of the interference caused by other devices and service providers requires careful engineering 
in order to offer our fixed wireless services we must deploy radios and antennas in the areas where we intend to offer the service 
this usually means that we need to secure roof or antenna rights in these markets  which requires additional expenditures 
our fixed wireless service uses pre wimax equipment 
wimax is a set of specifications for wireless equipment and services that will encourage the interoperability of solutions from different suppliers 
we currently plan to gradually upgrade our fixed wireless network to the wimax standard when this equipment is available 
dsl modems  telecommunications equipment and on site connection we buy customer premises equipment  or cpe  from our suppliers for resale to our customers 
in order to provide our business class services to an end user we currently have to configure and install cpe along with any required on site wiring needed to connect the cpe to the copper line leased from the ilec 
our fixed wireless services similarly require the deployment of cpe at the customer s location 
for our consumer access services  cpe is included in self installation kits provided by us or our resellers 
we ship the kits to end users  who  in most cases  perform their own installation 
customers who purchase our voip services from us may also purchase office telephone equipment  such as telephones and conference speakerphones competition we face significant competition in the markets for business and consumer internet access  network access  wireless broadband and voice services and we expect this competition to intensify 
the principal bases of competition in our markets include price and performance  discounted rates for bundles of services  breadth of 
table of contents service availability  reliability of service  network security  and ease of access and use 
we face competition from the following categories of companies rbocs verizon  qwest and at t  cable television companies providing broadband and voip  such as comcast corporation  cox communications  time warner  inc and charter communications  competitive telecommunications companies  such as megapath and xo communications  interexchange carriers including sprint and level communications  voip service providers  such as m networks  pingtone and cbeyond  telephone equipment providers offering voip services  such as nortel  avaya  cisco and lucent  internet service providers  such as earthlink and speakeasy 
net  online service providers  including companies such as aol  google and msn  a subsidiary of microsoft corp  and wireless and satellite service providers such as at t  sprint  verizon wireless  t mobile  starband communications inc  directv  echostar communications corporation  globalstar  lockheed  nextlink a subsidiary of xo holdings  starband communications and teledesic 
interconnection agreements with the regional bell operating companies a critical aspect of our business is our interconnection agreements with the three largest ilecs  the rbocs 
these agreements cover a number of aspects including prices we pay to lease access  both for stand alone and line shared lines  special conditioning on certain of these lines to enable the transmission of digital signals  prices and terms of central office space for our equipment  prices we pay and access we have to data transport facilities connecting our facilities in different central offices and network points of presence  interfaces that we can use to place orders  report network problems and monitor responses to our requests  dispute resolution processes we use to resolve disagreements  and terms of the interconnection agreement  its transferability to successors  its liability limits and other general aspects of the relationships 
we have entered into interconnection agreements with or otherwise obtained interconnection rights from the three rbocs in the states covering the metropolitan areas we serve 
rbocs often do not agree to our requested provisions in interconnection agreements 
when we cannot agree  the telecommunications act provides for arbitration of interconnection agreement terms before state public utility commissions  or pucs 
we have not consistently prevailed in obtaining our desired provisions in such agreements 
some of our interconnection agreements have a term of three years 
under our interconnection agreements  either party can request renegotiation prior to the agreement s expiration if there is a change in law 
we will also have to renew these agreements when they expire 
although we expect to renew the interconnection agreements that require renewal and believe the telecommunications act limits the ability of ilecs not to renew such agreements  we may not succeed in extending or renegotiating our interconnection agreements on favorable terms 
additionally  disputes have arisen and will likely arise in the future as a result of differences in interpretations of the interconnection agreements 
in the past  these disputes have delayed our deployment of our network 
such disputes have also adversely affected our service to our customers and our ability to enter into additional interconnection agreements with the rbocs in other states 
finally  the interconnection agreements are subject to state pucs  
table of contents federal communications commission  or fcc  and judicial oversight 
these government authorities may modify the terms of the interconnection agreements in a way that hurts our business 
government regulation overview our services are subject to a variety of federal laws and regulations 
with respect to certain activities and for certain purposes  we have also submitted our operations to the jurisdiction of state and local authorities who may also assert more extensive jurisdiction over our facilities and services 
the fcc has jurisdiction over our facilities and services to the extent that we provide interstate and international communications services 
to the extent we provide certain identifiable intrastate services  our services and facilities may be subject to a variety of state laws and regulations 
rates for the services and network elements we purchase from the rbocs are  in many cases  determined by the applicable state pucs 
in addition  local municipal governments may assert jurisdiction over our facilities and operations  such as through government owned rights of way and local zoning 
the precise jurisdictional reach of the various federal  state and local authorities is uncertain because it is subject to ongoing controversy and judicial review 
recent developments on june   the united states court of appeals for the dc circuit upheld the fcc s february   order changing its rules regarding the obligations of ilecs to share their networks with competitive telecommunications companies like us 
these rules include the following changes if certain criteria are met  ilecs can stop providing new transport services between the telephone companies central offices at regulated rates  which are usually lower than commercially available rates 
these criteria are based on the number of business lines served by the connected central offices and the number of alternative providers collocated in the central offices 
this rule went into effect on march  for existing transport services where the criteria are met  ilecs are required to continue to provide the services with a price increase of for either twelve or eighteen months after the order went into effect 
the twelve and eighteen month periods expired on march  and september   at which time commercially available rates prevailed 
we currently purchase interoffice transport from the ilecs in order to carry traffic over our network 
this change increased our data transport costs by approximately  in and we expect it will increase our data transport costs in by approximately  in addition  ilecs are no longer required to provide new high capacity unbundled ds and ds lines at regulated rates in locations where certain criteria are met 
these criteria are based on the number of business lines served by the central office and the number of alternative providers collocated in the central office 
this rule went into effect on march  for existing high capacity ds and ds lines where the criteria are met  ilecs are required to continue to provide the lines for a twelve month transition period with a price increase of 
the transition period expired on march   at which time commercially available rates prevailed 
we use ds lines to provide business grade services to our end users 
this change increased our cost to purchase ds lines by approximately in ilecs are no longer required to provide new dark fiber lines at regulated rates 
as of march   commercially available rates for these services prevail 
in certain areas  we purchase dark fiber to transport data traffic within our network 
currently we purchase our dark fiber from non ilec providers 
however  if we are unable to purchase dark fiber from non ilec providers in the future  we expect this change will increase our cost to purchase dark fiber lines 
at this time we cannot reliably quantify the aggregate amount of these increases  if any 
competitive telecommunications carriers  including our resellers  can no longer purchase voice services from the ilecs under an arrangement known as the unbundled network element platform  or une p  for new customers at regulated rates 
the existence of une p had allowed us to bundle our data services with the voice services of competitive telecommunications providers through line splitting arrangements 
we currently bundle services in this manner only with competitive telecommunications providers that have agreements with the ilecs to allow them continued access to une p or similar resold services 
as discussed above  we have deployed an alternative method of delivering residential voice services with our lpva service  which enables our strategic reseller  earthlink  to offer local and long distance voice services to its customers bundled with our data services in competition with the local telephone companies 

table of contents the new rules took effect on march  implementation of the rules is governed by the interconnection agreements between ilecs and competitive carriers 
the implementation and interpretation of the rules  including the dates that specific aspects of the new rules affect network elements  continue to be the subject of disputes in state pucs and other venues 
the fcc decision mentioned above was a modification of the fcc s previous triennial review order  which was issued on august   referred to as the original triennial review order 
this order also represented a significant development for us because the fcc decided to phase out its rule requiring line sharing pursuant to section of the telecommunications act over a three year period 
line sharing allows us to provision services using adsl technology over the same telephone line that the ilec is using to provide voice services 
the phase out period will be handled in the following manner our line shared customers as of october  were grandfathered indefinitely at current rates  terms and conditions 
these line shared customers provided approximately   and  or  and  of our revenues for  and  respectively 
for line shared customers acquired from october  to october   the fcc mandated maximum price for the high frequency portion of the telephone line was of the cost of a separate telephone line during the first year  of the cost of a separate telephone line from october  to october   and of the cost of a separate telephone line from october  to october  after october   we were required to transition these customers to new arrangements  which could include continued provision of services pursuant to commercial agreements 
as of october   we could no longer acquire new line shared customers at regulated rates under section of the telecommunications act of we have reached agreements that provide us with continued access to line sharing with the three rbocs at t except for the former bellsouth region that is now part of at t  verizon and qwest  accounting for approximately of our line shared customer base 
our agreements regarding line sharing with at t  verizon and qwest expire in may of  december of and october of  respectively 
in the event that we do not obtain favorable regulatory rulings for line sharing or enter into and maintain line sharing agreements with the rbocs  we will be required to purchase a separate telephone line in order to provide services to an end user in the areas served by rbocs 
if this occurs we may stop selling stand alone consumer grade services to new customers  because the cost of a separate telephone line is significantly higher than what we currently pay for a shared line and requires us to dispatch a technician to install the service 
our inability to acquire new line shared customers would limit our growth and negatively impact our ability to sell consumer dsl services 
in the original triennial review order  and subsequent orders  the fcc also decided that ilecs are not required to allow us to access certain types of fiber and fiber fed lines or the packet switching functions of fiber fed telephone lines to provision dsl services 
in a subsequent order  released october   the fcc also granted the rbocs forbearance from the obligation to provide access to the packet switching functions of fiber fed telephone lines under section of the telecommunications act of this means that  unless we reach agreements with the rbocs or obtain favorable regulatory rulings from the fcc or state regulators  we will continue to be unable to provide our most commonly used services to end users served by affected fiber fed lines 
our inability to access fiber and fiber fed packet switching functions is significant for our business because it limits the addressable market for our dsl services  thereby limiting our growth 
in addition  the rbocs are increasing their deployment of fiber lines and fiber fed remote terminal architectures  thereby limiting our addressable market 
the telecommunications act provided relief from the earnings restrictions and price controls that governed the local telephone business for many years 
since passage of the telecommunications act  the fcc has been less stringent in its review of tariff filings by the four largest ilecs  the rbocs  including filings for dsl services 
in particular  without substantive review of the cost support for the rbocs dsl services  rates for those services may be below cost and may facilitate price squeezes  predatory pricing or other exclusionary strategies by ilecs that harm our business 
on september   the fcc eliminated certain regulations that apply to the rbocs provision of broadband internet access services that are competitive with ours 
the fcc determined that rboc wireline broadband internet access services are defined under the communications act as information 
table of contents services functionally integrated with a telecommunications component  and relieved rbocs of related common carrier  tariffing  and non discrimination obligations 
the fcc also provided the rbocs with flexibility to offer the transmission component of wireline broadband internet access service to affiliated or unaffiliated isps on a common carrier basis  a non common carrier basis  or some combination of both 
the fcc s new regulatory classification of broadband internet access service does not impact competitive local exchange carriers  or clecs  ability to access unes under section of the telecommunications act and the fcc s rules 
we expect that this additional regulatory freedom and any additional regulatory freedom granted to the rbocs in this area will increase the competition we face from the rbocs services and could reduce our access to ilec facilities and services 
on february   sbc and at t filed applications at the fcc to request a transfer of at t s licenses and authorizations to sbc  pursuant to sbc s planned acquisition of at t 
on march   verizon and mci filed applications at the fcc to request a transfer of mci s licenses and authorizations to verizon  pursuant to verizon s planned acquisition of mci 
the us department of justice approved the acquisitions with certain limited divestiture conditions on october  on november   the fcc released orders approving both mergers 
the fcc s orders also contained conditions on its approval of the mergers that are favorable to competitive carriers 
such conditions include une and other service pricing freezes  recalculation of areas where the merged rbocs are required to share their networks with competitive telecommunications companies  special access availability  pricing  and service quality monitoring  and internet peering access and transparency 
these conditions are limited and are of varying durations 
on march   at t the combined sbc at t entity resulting from the merger and bellsouth filed applications at the fcc to request a transfer of bellsouth s licenses and authorizations to at t  pursuant to at t s planned acquisition of bellsouth 
the us department of justice approved the acquisition on october  on december   the fcc approved the acquisition  with conditions that are intended to be favorable to competitive telecommunications companies 
such conditions include une and other service price freezes  recalculation of areas where the merged at t bellsouth entity is required to share their networks with competitive telecommunications companies  special access availability  pricing  and service quality monitoring  internet peering access and transparency  and limitations on the use of regulatory forbearance to erode the benefits of the conditions 
another condition requires that at t offer stand alone  or naked  adsl service to its retail customers for a month  which is significantly lower that the price that our resellers charge for similar services 
these conditions are limited and are of varying durations 
each of the fcc decisions in this area has been or will likely be challenged by various participants in the telecommunications industry 
we expect that many of the components of these rules will be the subject of continuing litigation that could influence their ultimate impact 
as such  it is not possible for us to predict the final effects of these rules with assurance 
investors should review this discussion of the fcc s recent rulemaking and the actual fcc orders carefully to understand the potentially significant effects that these proceedings may have on our ability to continue to engage in our business as we have in the past  as the fcc s rulings create a number of uncertainties  risks  challenges and opportunities for us 
federal and state voip regulation as a result of the growing deployment of voip services  the fcc has taken action to extend to many voip services regulations applicable to traditional voice services 
for example  on june   the fcc released rules requiring voip carriers interconnected with the public switched telephone network  or pstn  to provide enhanced  or e  service to customers 
on september   the fcc released rules requiring certain broadband internet providers and voip carriers interconnected with the pstn to accommodate wiretaps pursuant to the communications assistance for law enforcement act  or calea 
on june   the fcc extended fusf contribution obligations to voip providers that connect through the publicly switched telephone network 
this fcc decision has been challenged by various parties and the outcome of this challenged could influence the ultimate impact of these rules 
additionally  the fcc is conducting other regulatory proceedings that could further affect our regulatory duties and rights as a voip provider 
there is regulatory uncertainty as to the imposition of access charges and other regulations  taxes  fees and surcharges on voip services 

table of contents if the fcc chose to adopt such regulations  it could impact our ability to offer new services in a cost efficient manner 
the state pucs are also conducting regulatory proceedings that could impact our rights and obligations with respect to voip 
in an order released november   the fcc determined that internet telephony services like our voip service are not subject to traditional regulation by the state pucs 
this order has been appealed to the courts  and it is unclear what the outcome of this litigation will be 
we cannot predict the outcome of these regulatory and legal proceedings or any similar petitions and regulatory proceedings pending before the fcc or state pucs 
moreover  we cannot predict how their outcomes may affect our operations or whether the fcc or state pucs will impose additional requirements  regulations or charges upon our provision of voip services 
other federal regulation we must comply with the requirements of the communications act of  as amended by the telecommunications act  as well as the fcc s regulations under the statute 
the telecommunications act eliminates many of the pre existing legal barriers to competition in the telecommunications and video communications businesses  preempts many of the state barriers to local telecommunications service competition that previously existed in state and local laws and regulations  and sets basic standards for relationships between telecommunications providers 
the law delegates to the fcc and the states broad regulatory and administrative authority to implement the telecommunications act 
among other things  the telecommunications act removes barriers to entry in the local telecommunications market 
it also requires that ilecs provide nondiscriminatory access and interconnection to potential competitors 
regulations promulgated by the fcc under the telecommunications act such as those discussed above under the heading recent developments specify in greater detail the requirements imposed on the ilecs to open their networks to competition by providing competitors interconnection  central office and remote terminal space  access to unbundled network elements  retail services at wholesale rates and nondiscriminatory access to telephone poles  ducts  conduits and rights of way 
the requirements allow companies like us to interconnect with the ilecs 
further  the telecommunications act provides the fcc with the authority to forbear from regulating entities such as us 
the fcc has exercised its forbearance authority 
as a result  we are not obligated to obtain prior approval from the fcc for our interstate services or file tariffs for such services 
we generally do not file tariffs for our interstate services 
we provide our interstate services to our customers on the basis of contracts rather than tariffs 
we believe that it is unlikely that the fcc will require us to file tariffs for our interstate services in the future 
we are  however  required to comply with certain obligations that attach to all telecommunications carriers 
for example  we are required to make payments into the federal universal service fund  or fusf  for some of our services 
the fusf is a federal fund to support various programs that ensure the availability of telecommunications services to  for example  schools  libraries  hospitals  and in high cost regions of the country 
we are required to pay a percentage of our interstate and international telecommunications and interconnected voip revenue to the fusf  and we generally pass that percentage through to our customers 
the amount we are required to pay into the fusf varies depending on the breakdown between  for example  our telecommunications revenue and non telecommunications  such as equipment sales and installation services  revenue 
in addition  we are not required to pay into the fusf for any revenues derived from information services 
the fcc has a proceeding underway to reexamine its fusf contribution rules  and the fcc and its fusf collection agent periodically change the rules related to those contributions  including the percentage and time period of interstate telecommunications revenue that a carrier must contribute to the fusf 
to the extent those rules are changed  or new interpretations of those rules results in an increase in the fusf contributions that we must make  we may be subject to increased liability for payments beyond what we have already contributed 
other state regulation to the extent we provide identifiable intrastate services or have otherwise submitted ourselves to the jurisdiction of the relevant state telecommunications regulatory pucs  we are subject to state jurisdiction 
in addition  certain states have required prior state certification as a prerequisite for processing and deciding an arbitration petition for interconnection under the telecommunications act 
we are authorized to operate as a clec in all of the states covering metropolitan statistical areas we serve 
we file tariffs in certain states for intrastate services as required by state law or regulation 
we are also subject to periodic financial and other 
table of contents reporting requirements of these states with respect to certain intrastate services 
jurisdictional determinations that some or all of our services are intrastate services could harm our business 
in particular  we could be deemed liable for payments into state universal service funds  which require telecommunications carriers providing intrastate services to pay a percentage of their intrastate revenues to support state programs that ensure universal availability of telecommunications and related services 
we do not believe that the services we offer on an interstate basis are subject to such state assessments  but a state commission or judicial decision to the contrary could subject us to liability for such payments 
each state puc has proceedings to determine the rates  charges and terms and conditions for collocation and unbundled network elements 
unbundled network elements are the various portions of an ilec s network that a competitive company can lease for purposes of building a facilities based competitive network  including telephone lines  central office collocation space  inter office transport  operational support systems  local switching and rights of way 
the rates in many of our interconnection agreements are interim rates and will be prospectively  and  in some cases  retroactively  affected by the permanent rates set by the various state pucs 
we have participated in unbundled network element rate proceedings in several states in an effort to reduce these rates 
if any state commission decides to increase unbundled network element rates our operating results would be adversely affected 
local government regulation we may be required to obtain various permits and authorizations from municipalities in which we operate our own facilities 
the issue of whether actions of local governments with respect to activities of carriers  including requiring payment of franchise fees or other surcharges  pose barriers to entry for competitive companies which may be preempted by the fcc is the subject of litigation 
although we rely primarily on the unbundled network elements of the ilecs  in certain instances we deploy our own facilities and  therefore  may need to obtain certain municipal permits or other authorizations 
the actions of municipal governments in imposing conditions on the grant of permits or other authorizations or their failure to act in granting such permits or other authorizations could harm our business 
the foregoing does not purport to describe all present and proposed federal  state and local regulations and legislation affecting the telecommunications industry 
other existing federal regulations are currently the subject of judicial proceedings  legislative hearings and administrative proposals which could change  in varying degrees  the manner in which communications companies operate in the united states 
the rbocs have periodically introduced federal and state legislation to relieve them from some or all of their obligations to provide us with access to their networks 
some states legislatures have approved these proposals 
it would be reasonable to expect that the rbocs will seek additional state and federal legislation that  if enacted into law  would adversely affect our business 
the ultimate outcome of these proceedings and the ultimate impact of the telecommunications act or any final regulations adopted pursuant to the telecommunications act on our business cannot be determined at this time but may well be adverse to our interests 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business and we can give no assurance that such future regulation or regulatory changes will not harm our business 
see part i  item a 
risk factors our services are subject to government regulation  and changes in current or future laws or regulations could adversely affect our business and part i  item a 
risk factors charges for network elements are generally outside of our control because they are proposed by the ilecs and are subject to costly regulatory approval processes 
significant customers we had approximately wholesale customers as of december  for  and  our largest wholesale customers in each such year collectively comprised  and of our total net revenues  respectively 
two of our wholesale customers each individually accounted for more than of our revenue at t accounted for  and of our total net revenues for  and  respectively  and earthlink accounted for   and of our total net revenues for  and  respectively 

table of contents intellectual property we regard certain aspects of our products  services and technology as proprietary and attempt to protect them with patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  restrictions on disclosure and other methods 
these methods may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
we also generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
currently we have fifteen patents granted and a number of patent applications pending 
we intend to seek additional patent protection for our systems and services to the extent possible 
these patents may not be issued to us 
even if they are issued  they may not protect our intellectual property from competition 
competitors may design around or seek to invalidate these patents 
further  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to control the ultimate destination of our proprietary information 
steps taken by us may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our technology 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources 
in addition  others may sue us alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights 
a manufacturer of telecommunications hardware named covid has filed an opposition to our trademark application for the mark covad and design 
covid is also seeking to cancel our trademark registration for the covad name 
we do not believe that these challenges to our trademark application and granted trademark have merit 
however  these proceedings are unpredictable and there is no guarantee we will prevail 
if we do not succeed  it could limit our ability to provide our services under the covad name 
employees as of december   we had employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
our ability to achieve our financial and operational objectives depends in large part upon the continued service of our senior management and key technical  sales  marketing  legal  finance  human resources and managerial personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical  sales  marketing  legal  accounting and managerial personnel 
competition for such qualified personnel is intense  particularly in software development  network engineering and product management

table of contents item a 
risk factors all dollar and share amounts are presented in thousands  except per share amounts investing in and holding our common stock involve a degree of risk 
many factors  including those described below and set forth elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
if any of these risks materialize  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
these risks are not the only ones we face 
additional risks that we currently do not know about or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business 
our services are subject to government regulation  and changes in current or future laws or regulations and the methods of enforcing the law and regulations could adversely affect our business 
our services are subject to federal  state and local government regulations 
in particular  the company and its resellers are dependent on certain provisions of the telecommunications act to procure certain facilities and services from the rbocs that are necessary to provide our services 
as a result  our business is highly dependent on rules and rulings from the fcc  legislative actions at both the state and federal level  and rulings from state pucs 
over the last several years the fcc has made substantial changes to the regulatory environment in which we operate 
the fcc s august  triennial review order and its release of further changes to its network unbundling rules on february   limited  and in some cases eliminated our access to some of the network elements that we use to operate our business 
these orders were challenged by several parties  but in june the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit affirmed the fcc s rules 
where we no longer have regulated access to network elements  our costs are likely to increase as a result of these orders and we may be unable to profitably offer some of our services 
we may be unable to adapt to the changed regulatory environment  in its current form  or to future changes  whether resulting from these orders or from subsequent action by congress  state legislatures  the courts  the fcc  or other regulatory authorities 
in addition  the fcc s august triennial review order and related subsequent orders provided that rboc fiber based facilities and packet based facilities were no longer required to be unbundled and made available to competitive carriers like us 
the rbocs have each announced plans to aggressively deploy new fiber and packet based facilities as replacements for the copper loop based facilities that we use to provide our services 
this substitution of fiber and packet based facilities and related phase out of copper lines will reduce the portion of the market for data and voice services that we can reach utilizing our wireline network 
while we are pursuing alternative means of providing services where this occurs  including commercial access agreements with the rbocs and alternative means of providing services  such as fixed wireless  we may not be successful in these efforts  and there may be material adverse effects on our financial condition 
most recently  on september   verizon filed petitions at the fcc requesting forbearance from the regulatory requirement to provide competitors access to lines and transport at cost based rates in the metropolitan statistical areas of boston  new york  philadelphia  pittsburgh  providence  and virginia beach 
ongoing access to these network elements at cost based rates  particularly in the boston  new york  and philadelphia markets  is material to our ability to profitably offer our services 
the fcc is required to act on these petitions by december grant of the verizon petitions  in whole or in part  could significantly increase the costs of providing our services and have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
charges for network elements are generally outside of our control because they are proposed by the ilecs and are subject to costly regulatory approval processes 
ilecs provide the copper lines that connect the vast majority of our end users to our equipment located in their central offices 
the telecommunications act generally requires that charges for these unbundled network elements be cost based and nondiscriminatory 
nonetheless  the nonrecurring and recurring monthly charges for copper lines that we require vary greatly 
these rates are subject to negotiations between us and the ilecs and to the approval of the state pucs 
consequently  we are subject to the risk that the non recurring and recurring charges for lines and other unbundled network elements will increase based on higher rates proposed by the ilecs and 
table of contents approved by state pucs from time to time  which would increase our operating expenses and reduce our ability to provide competitive products 
the impact of regulatory and judicial decisions on access to or the prices we pay to the ilecs for collocation and unbundled network elements is uncertain 
there is a risk that ongoing access to collocation and unbundled network elements will be reduced or eliminated in particular markets over time 
there is also a risk that any new prices set by the regulators could be significantly higher than current prices 
if we are denied access to collocation or network components or are required to pay higher prices to the ilecs for collocation and network components  it could materially increase our operating expenses and reduce our ability to provide competitive products 
our business will be adversely affected if our interconnection agreements are not renewed or if they are modified on unfavorable terms 
we are required to enter into interconnection agreements covering each of the states we serve with the appropriate ilecs in order to provide service in those regions 
many of our existing interconnection agreements have a maximum term of three years 
therefore  we will have to renegotiate these agreements with the ilecs when they expire 
a number of these agreements have expired and we are currently in the process of renegotiating them 
we may not succeed in extending or renegotiating these interconnection agreements on favorable terms or at all 
as the fcc modifies changes and implements its rules related to unbundling and collocation  we generally have to renegotiate our interconnection agreements to implement those new or modified rules 
for example  we are involved in a number of renegotiations of interconnection agreements to reflect the fcc s recent decisions 
we may be unable to renegotiate these agreements in a timely manner  or we may be forced to arbitrate and litigate in order to obtain agreement terms that fully comply with fcc rules 
additionally  disputes have arisen and will likely continue to arise in the future as a result of different interpretations of the interconnection agreements 
these disputes have delayed and could further delay the deployment of network capabilities and services  and resolution of any litigated matters will require ongoing expenditures and management time 
in addition  the interconnection agreements are subject to state puc  fcc and judicial oversight 
these government authorities may modify the terms of the interconnection agreements in a way that reduces our access to  or increases the cost of  the network components that we purchase from the ilecs 
we depend on a limited number of customers for the preponderance of our revenues  and we are highly dependent on sales through our resellers 
the majority of our revenue comes from internet service providers  telecommunications carriers and other customers who resell our internet access and other services to their business and consumer end users 
our agreements with our resellers are generally non exclusive  and many of our customers also resell services offered by our competitors 
our agreements with our resellers generally do not contain purchase commitments 
a limited number of resellers account for a significant portion of our revenues 
our top resellers accounted for approximately of our net revenues for we expect that our reseller customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue and new end user additions 
if we were to lose one or more of our key resellers or if one or more of our key resellers stopped providing us with orders or removed end users from our network  our revenue and line growth could be materially adversely affected 
consolidations  mergers and acquisitions involving our key resellers have occurred in the past and may occur in the future 
these consolidations  mergers and acquisitions may cause key resellers to stop providing us with orders or to remove end users from our network 
on january   one of our major resellers  at t corp  was acquired by sbc  one of the largest rbocs and also one of our larger resellers 
the surviving company is now known as at t  inc on january   another one of our resellers  mci  was acquired by verizon 
the combined at t entity and verizon including mci are both our competitors and resellers of our services and account for a significant portion of our revenues 
at this time  we cannot predict the effects of these transactions on our revenues derived from the new combined at t or from mci  or the timing of any such effects 

table of contents the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively  especially against established industry competitors with significantly greater financial resources 
we face significant competition in the markets for business and consumer internet access  network access and voice services and we expect this competition to intensify 
we face competition from the rbocs  cable modem service providers  competitive telecommunications companies  traditional and new national long distance carriers  internet service providers  on line service providers and wireless and satellite service providers 
many of these competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  better strategic relationships and significantly greater financial  technical or marketing resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to develop and adopt new or emerging technologies  respond to changes in customer requirements more quickly  devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services  form new alliances and rapidly acquire significant market share  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and devote substantially more resources to developing new services 
the intense competition from our competitors  including the rbocs  the cable modem service providers and the competitive telecommunications companies could harm our business 
the rbocs represent the dominant competition in all of our target service areas  and we expect this competition to intensify 
the rbocs have established brand names and reputations for quality service  possess sufficient capital to deploy new dsl equipment and other competing products and services rapidly  have their own telephone lines and can bundle digital data services with their existing voice  wireless and other services to achieve economies of scale in serving customers 
they can also offer service to end users using fiber and fiber fed lines that they are not required to make available to us 
certain rbocs are aggressively pricing their consumer dsl service subscription fees below per month when ordered as part of a bundle  which has slowed sales of consumer dsl services by our reseller partners and increased the rate of churn among our existing users 
we believe that we pose a competitive risk to the rbocs and  as both our competitors and our suppliers  they have the ability and the motivation to disadvantage our business 
if we are unable to enter into and maintain our agreements with the rbocs that provide us with access to line sharing at reasonable rates  we will be unable to price our consumer services at a price that is competitive with the rbocs 
cable modem service providers  such as cox communications  comcast  and time warner  and their respective cable company customers  have deployed high speed internet access services over coaxial cable networks 
these networks provide similar  and in some cases  higher speed data services than we provide 
in addition  cable providers are bundling voip telephony and other services  such as video on demand  with their internet access offerings 
as a result  competition with the cable modem service providers may have a significant negative effect on our ability to secure customers and may create downward pressure on the prices we can charge for our services 
new competitors in the market for voip services and improvements in the quality of voip service provided by competitors over the public internet could increase competition for our voip services 
our business plan is based partly on our ability to provide local and long distance voice services at a lower rate than our competitors 
we expect price competition to increase in the voip market due to increasing emphasis on voip by the local telephone companies and new entrants to the voip market 
because networks using voip technology can be deployed with less capital investment than traditional networks  there are lower barriers to entry in this market and it may be easier for new competitors to emerge 
increasing competition may cause us to lower our prices or may make it more difficult to attract and retain customers 

table of contents we believe that our voip service does not compete with providers who use the public internet to transmit communications traffic  as these providers generally cannot provide the quality of service necessary for business grade services 
future technology advances  however  may enable these providers to offer an improved quality of services to business customers over the internet with lower costs than we incur by using a private network 
this could also lead to increased price competition 
failure to complete development  upgrades  testing and introduction of new services  including voip services  could affect our ability to compete in the industry 
we continuously develop  test and introduce new services that are delivered over our network 
these new services are intended to allow us to address new segments of the communications marketplace and to compete for additional customers 
in some cases  the introduction of new services requires the successful development of new technology 
in addition  some of the equipment in our network will need to be replaced as it becomes obsolete and in order to accommodate the increasing bandwidth that our customers require 
to the extent that upgrades of existing technology are required for the introduction of new services  the success of these upgrades may depend on the conclusion of contract negotiations with vendors and vendors meeting their obligations in a timely manner 
in addition  new service offerings may not operate as intended and may not be widely accepted by customers 
if we are not able to successfully complete the development and introduction of new services and enhancements to our existing services  including voip  lpva  and fixed wireless services  in a timely manner  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we may need to raise additional capital under difficult financial market conditions 
we believe our current cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments in debt securities should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures until we become cash flow positive 
we have a business plan for that we believe will take us to the point where our operations will yield a positive cash flow without raising additional capital 
this business plan is based upon several assumptions  including growth of our subscriber base with a reasonable per subscriber profit margin and improvements in productivity 
if actual events differ from these assumptions  we may be required to alter our business plan to reflect these changes 
we will continue to monitor events to determine if such adjustments to our business plan are appropriate 
we are currently facing a variety of challenges that may affect the assumptions contained in our business plan  including  among others customer disconnection rates that reduce our revenues  significant price reductions by our competitors  higher levels of marketing expense required to acquire and retain end users that purchase our services from us and from our resellers  the need to upgrade our systems by investing in our existing and future technology and infrastructure  investment opportunities in complementary businesses  acquisitions or other opportunities  changes in government regulations and legal actions challenging government regulations  and additional risk factors mentioned throughout this section 
in march we issued a  senior secured convertible note to earthlink  inc  or earthlink  and in september we issued an additional  senior secured convertible note to earthlink collectively the earthlink convertible notes 
this note is due in and  under specified circumstances  we may be required to repay the principal amount prior to in addition  the terms of the earthlink convertible notes and our  senior secured credit facility with silicon valley bank  or svb  include restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business 
if we do not comply with such covenants  or if any other event of default occurs under these agreements  our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings 
these restrictive covenants and the collateralization of the earthlink convertible 
table of contents notes and the silicon valley bank senior secured credit facility  in addition to the existence of  in convertible debentures  may also limit our ability to raise additional capital through sales of debt or equity securities 
adverse business  regulatory or legislative developments may require us to raise additional financing  raise our prices or substantially decrease our cost structure 
we also recognize that we may not be able to raise additional capital under the current capital market conditions 
if we are unable to acquire additional capital or are required to raise it on terms that are less satisfactory than we desire  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
in order to become cash flow positive and to achieve profitability  we must add end users and sell additional services to our existing end users while minimizing the cost to upgrade and expand our network infrastructure 
we must increase the volume of internet  data and voice transmission on our network in order to realize the anticipated cash flow  operating efficiencies and cost benefits of our network 
if we do not add new customers and maintain our relationships with current customers  we may not be able to substantially increase traffic on our network  which would adversely affect our ability to become profitable 
to accomplish this strategy  we must  among other things acquire new end users  efficiently deploy lpva services under our agreement with earthlink  enter into and maintain agreements with the rbocs or obtain favorable regulatory rulings that provide us with access to unbundled network elements on terms and conditions that allow us to profitably sell our consumer services  enhance  improve and increase sales of our voip services  upgrade our network to improve reliability and remain competitive  efficiently expand fixed wireless broadband services  expand our direct sales capability and infrastructure in a cost effective manner  and continue to implement and improve our management information systems  including our client ordering  provisioning  dispatch  trouble ticketing  customer billing  accounts receivable  payable tracking  collection  fixed assets  transaction based taxes and other management information systems 
our growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our management and operations 
our customers are using increasing amounts of bandwidth as they use applications like voip and streaming video 
we expect to replace equipment in our network as it becomes obsolete  implement system upgrades  new software releases and other enhancements which will require additional expenditures and may cause disruption and dislocation in our business 
if we are successful in implementing our marketing strategy  we may have difficulty responding to demand for our services and technical support in a timely manner and in accordance with our customers expectations 
we expect these demands may require increased outsourcing of covad functions to third parties 
we may be unable to do this successfully  in which case we could experience an adverse effect on our financial performance 
our end user disconnection rate reduces our revenue and end user growth 
we experience high disconnection or churn rates 
our high end user churn rate continues to impair the growth we need to cover the cost of maintaining our network 
these disconnections occur as a result of several factors  including end users who move to a new location  disconnect because of better offers in the market  or disconnect because they do not like our service or the service provided by our resellers 

table of contents while we are working to address problems with the end user experience  many of these factors are beyond our control 
as a result  our churn rates may increase even if we improve the customer experience 
in addition  promotions and rebates that we offer to our resellers and end users are based on an assumption that a given end user will maintain our service for a period of time 
if our disconnection rate increases for more recently added end users  we may not recoup the money we spend on these promotions and rebates 
we may experience decreasing margins on the sale of our services  which may impair our ability to achieve profitability or positive cash flow 
prices for our services have steadily decreased since we first began operations 
we expect we will continue to experience an overall price decrease for our services due to competition  volume based pricing and other factors 
we currently charge higher prices for some of our services than some of our competitors do for similar services 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our customers will select our services over those of our competitors 
in addition  prices for digital communications services in general have fallen historically  and we expect this trend to continue 
as a result of these factors  we cannot predict whether demand for our services will exist at prices that enable us to achieve profitability or positive cash flow 
if our internal controls over financial reporting do not comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  our business  reputation and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to annually attest to  and report on  management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting 
although our management has determined  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december   we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal controls in the future 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered adequate  we may experience a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and our stock price 
some of our resellers are facing financial difficulties  which makes it more difficult to predict our revenues 
some of our reseller customers may experience financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
if a customer cannot provide us with reasonable assurance of payment  then we only recognize revenue when we collect cash for our services  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  and only after we have collected all previous accounts receivable balances 
although we will continue to try to obtain payments from these customers  it is likely that one or more of these customers will not pay us for our services 
with respect to resellers that are in bankruptcy proceedings  we similarly may not be able to collect sums owed to us by these customers and we also may be required to refund pre petition amounts paid to us during the days prior to the bankruptcy filing 
the existence of our direct business poses challenges and may cause our resellers to place fewer orders with us or may cause us to lose resellers 
although the majority of our revenue comes from resellers who purchase our services  sales of services directly to end user customers represent a significant and growing part of our business 
as we expand our direct business  we face multiple challenges 
these challenges include  but are not limited to  our ability to recruit  hire and train additional direct sales teams  reduce our cost of acquiring new customers  improve our voip provisioning  network management and monitoring and billing systems  manage expanding and increasingly diverse distribution channels  
table of contents effectively manage additional vendors  and continue to enhance our network and improve our voip services 
in addition  some of our existing resellers may perceive us as a potential or actual competitor 
as a result  these resellers may stop or slow their purchases of our services 
the communications industry is undergoing rapid technological changes and new technologies may be superior to the technology we use 
the communications industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes  including continuing developments in dsl and voip technology and alternative technologies for providing broadband and telephony communications  such as cable modem  satellite and wireless technology 
in addition  much of the equipment in our network has been in service for several years and may become inferior to new technologies 
as a consequence  our success may depend on third parties  including some of our competitors and potential competitors  to develop and provide us with access to new communications and networking technology  our ability to anticipate or adapt to new technology on a timely basis  and our ability to adapt to new products and technologies that may be superior to  or may not be compatible with  our products and technologies 
the investments required to address technological changes are difficult to predict and may exceed our available resources 
if we fail to adapt successfully to technological changes or fail to obtain access to important technologies  our business will be adversely affected 
a system failure could delay or interrupt service to our customers  which could reduce demand for our services 
our operations depend upon our ability to support our highly complex network infrastructure and avoid damage from fires  earthquakes  terrorist attacks  floods  power losses  excessive sustained or peak user demand  telecommunications failures  network software flaws  transmission cable cuts and similar events 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problem at our network operations center or any of our regional data centers could cause interruptions in our services 
similarly  if our third party providers fail to maintain their facilities properly or fail to respond quickly to network or other problems  our customers may experience interruptions in the service they obtain from us 
our voip and lpva services rely on internet protocol  or ip  technology  which is different from  and much newer than  the legacy circuit switch technology used by the traditional telephone companies and other providers of traditional communications services 
although we believe that ip technology is well designed for the provision of a broad array of communications services to high numbers of users  we cannot assure that our ip based network can handle increasingly higher volumes of voice and data traffic as we grow our business or as our customers usage increases  that it can adapt to future technological advancements  or that it will be reliable over long periods of time 
we have experienced some interruptions in our voip service as a result of network and equipment issues as we enhance and improve this service 
any damage or failure that interrupts our operations negatively impacts our reputation and makes it more difficult to attract and retain customers 
our use of fixed broadband wireless technology presents several challenges 
as a result of our acquisition of nextweb and the assets of dataflo in  we now offer fixed broadband wireless service to a small portion of our customers 
fixed broadband wireless services are not as widely used as our dsl and t services  which creates several unique challenges 
first  there are fewer providers of equipment that we need to provide this service and the providers that exist are smaller than our traditional providers of network equipment 
this may result in shortages of the equipment that we require or may cause us to pay more for this equipment 
our fixed wireless service uses pre wimax equipment 
wimax is a set of specifications for wireless equipment and services that will encourage the interoperability of solutions from different suppliers 
we currently 
table of contents plan to gradually upgrade our fixed wireless network to the wimax standard when this equipment is available  which will require additional capital expenditures 
our use of unlicensed spectrum to provide fixed wireless service also presents unique challenges 
since the spectrum is unlicensed  there may be a large number of users of this spectrum in the areas where we offer our service 
we carefully manage the interference caused by other devices and service providers  but this could become increasingly difficult as additional users of unlicensed spectrum emerge 
if we are unsuccessful in managing this interference  our customers may become dissatisfied and stop purchasing our services 
a breach of network security could delay or interrupt service to our customers  which could reduce demand for our services 
our network may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses  worms and trojan horses and other disruptions 
internet service providers  telecommunications carriers and corporate networks have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  interruptions in service as a result of accidental or intentional actions of internet users  current and former employees and others 
unauthorized access could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in our computer systems  our end users and our reseller s end users 
this might result in liability to us and also might deter potential customers from purchasing or selling our services 
while we attempt to implement and develop additional security measures we have not implemented all of the security measures commercially available  and we may not implement such measures in a timely manner or at all 
moreover  these measures  if and when implemented  may be circumvented  and eliminating computer viruses and alleviating other security problems may require interruptions  delays or cessation of service to our customers and our reseller s customers  which could harm our business 
our success depends on our retention of certain key personnel  our ability to hire additional key personnel and the maintenance of good labor relations 
we depend on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
in particular  our senior management has significant experience in the telecommunications industry and the loss of any of them could negatively affect our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our future success also depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train and retain other highly qualified technical  operations  sales  marketing  finance  legal  human resource  and managerial personnel as we add end users to our network 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
our reduced stock price has greatly reduced or eliminated the value of stock options held by many of our employees  making it more difficult to retain employees in a competitive market 
in addition  in the event that our employees unionize  we could incur higher ongoing labor costs and disruptions in our operations in the event of a strike or other work stoppage 
we depend on a limited number of third parties for equipment supply  software utilities  service and installation and if we are unable to obtain these items from these third parties we may not be able to deliver our services as required 
we rely on outside parties to manufacture our network equipment and provide certain network services 
these services  software and equipment include dslams  cpe  including modems  routers  bridges and other devices  network routing and switching hardware  customer support  installation services  customized software design and maintenance  network management software  
table of contents systems management software  database management software  collocation space  software used in our products  hosting  email and ip provisioning services  softswitches  used to provide voip services  and internet connectivity and internet protocol services 
we have in the past experienced supply problems with certain vendors 
these vendors may not be able to meet our needs in a satisfactory and timely manner in the future  which may cause us to lose revenue 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional vendors when needed 
our reliance on third party vendors involves additional risks  including the possibility that some of our vendors will leave the dsl equipment business or will stop supporting equipment that we already have installed  the absence of guaranteed capacity  the possibility that vendors will stop supporting software or equipment that we use or will no longer offer supplemental or replacement parts  and reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  production yields and costs 
any of these events could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we use third party vendors offshore for tasks that were previously done by our employees 
since we have used offshore vendors to assist us with software development and certain customer support functions 
because we are using a third party vendor to manage these day to day operations  we do not have as much control over the hiring and oversight of the vendors employees 
in addition  the differences in time zones  languages and culture also present challenges 
as a result  this arrangement may impair our ability to modify and improve our software and to develop new software in a timely manner 
in addition  we have provided these vendors with access to our intellectual property 
while we have taken certain contractual and procedural steps to protect our intellectual property  if any of the vendors or their employees improperly uses our intellectual property  it may be more difficult for us to assert our intellectual property rights because we may not be able to use united states courts to enforce our rights 
in outsourcing certain support functions to offshore vendors  we face similar challenges as with our software outsourcing arrangements 
in addition  these vendors may have difficulties communicating with our customers and resolving non standard customer issues 
we also may experience difficulties integrating the vendor s systems with our own 
some of these offshore locations have experienced civil unrest and terrorism and have been involved in conflicts with neighboring countries 
if some of these locations become engaged in armed hostilities  particularly if these hostilities are protracted or involved the threat of or use of weapons of mass destruction  our vendors operations could be adversely affected 
while we have attempted to contractually protect ourselves against calamities  if our vendors operations are adversely affected  our customer service and software development efforts could be negatively impacted 
we have made and may make acquisitions of complementary technologies or businesses in the future  which may disrupt our business and be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
we intend to consider acquisitions of businesses and technologies in the future on an opportunistic basis 
acquisitions of businesses and technologies involve numerous risks  including the diversion of management 
table of contents attention  difficulties in assimilating the acquired operations  loss of key employees from the acquired company  and difficulties in transitioning key customer relationships 
in addition  these acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt and large one time expenditures 
any such acquisition may not provide the benefits originally anticipated  and there may be difficulty in integrating the service offerings and networks gained through acquisitions and strategic investments with our own 
although we attempt to minimize the risk of unexpected liabilities and contingencies associated with acquired businesses through planning  investigation and negotiation  unexpected liabilities nevertheless may accompany such strategic investments and acquisitions 
in addition  the purchase price of an acquired business may exceed the current fair value of the net tangible assets of the acquired business 
as a result  we would be required to record material amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets  which could result in significant impairment charges and amortization expense in future periods 
these charges  in addition to the results of operations of such acquired businesses  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot forecast the number  timing or size of future acquisitions  or the effect that any such acquisitions might have on our operating or financial results 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we are required to review our goodwill on at least an annual basis 
if presently unforeseen events or changes in circumstances arise which indicate that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable  we will be required to perform impairment reviews of these assets  which have carrying values of  and  respectively  as of december  an impairment review could result in a write down of all or a portion of these assets to their fair values 
we will perform an annual impairment review of our goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in light of the large carrying value associated with our goodwill and intangible assets  any write down of these assets may result in a significant charge to our statement of operations in the period any impairment is determined and could cause our stock price to decline 
we must pay federal  state and local taxes and other surcharges on our services  the applicability and levels of which are uncertain 
telecommunications providers pay a variety of surcharges and fees on their gross revenues from interstate and intrastate services 
interstate surcharges include fusf and common carrier regulatory fees 
in addition  state regulators impose similar surcharges and fees on intrastate services and the applicability of these surcharges and fees to our services is uncertain in many cases 
the division of our services between interstate and intrastate services  and between services that are subject to surcharges and fees and those that are not  is a matter of interpretation and may in the future be contested by the fcc or state authorities 
the fcc is currently considering the nature of internet service provider bound traffic and new interpretations or changes in the characterization of jurisdictions or service categories could cause our payment obligations  pursuant to the relevant surcharges  to increase or result in liabilities 
for example  the fcc recently determined that  beginning in the fourth quarter of  carriers will be required to collect fusf on voip services  which will increase the amount that our customers pay for our service 
in addition  periodic revisions by state and federal regulators of the applicable surcharges may increase the surcharges and fees we currently pay 
in addition  we may be required to pay certain state taxes  including sales taxes  depending on the jurisdictional treatment of the services we offer 
the amount of those taxes could be significant  depending on the extent to which the various states choose to tax our services 
the federal government and many states apply transaction based taxes to the sales of our products and services and to our purchases of telecommunications services from various carriers 
we are in discussions with federal and state tax authorities regarding the extent of our transaction based tax liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of our transaction based tax liabilities could materially change in the near term 
we may or may not be able to recover some of those taxes from our customers 

table of contents we are a party to litigation and adverse results of such litigation matters could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
we are a defendant in some of the litigation matters described in part i  item legal proceedings 
while we are vigorously defending these lawsuits  the total outcome of these litigation matters is inherently unpredictable  and there is no guarantee we will prevail 
adverse results in any of these actions could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations and  in some circumstances result in a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  defending such actions could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our intellectual property protection may be inadequate to protect our proprietary rights 
we regard certain aspects of our products  services and technology as proprietary 
we attempt to protect them with patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  restrictions on disclosure and other methods 
these methods may not be sufficient to protect our technology 
we also generally enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees and consultants  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  or to develop similar technology independently 
currently  we have been issued fifteen patents and we have a number of additional patent applications pending 
we intend to prepare additional applications and to seek patent protection for our systems and services 
these patents may not be issued to us 
if issued  they may not protect our intellectual property from competition 
competitors could design around or seek to invalidate these patents 
effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
the global nature of the internet makes it virtually impossible to control the ultimate destination of our proprietary information 
the steps that we have taken may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our technology 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could harm our business 
third parties may claim we infringe their intellectual property rights 
we periodically receive notices from others claiming we are infringing their intellectual property rights  principally patent rights 
we expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows  the functionality of products overlap  and the volume of issued patents and patent applications continues to increase 
responding to infringement claims  regardless of their validity  could be time consuming  costly and result in litigation  divert management s time and attention from developing our business  require us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable  require us to stop selling or to redesign certain of our products  or require us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be adversely affected 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile  which may result in losses to investors 
we believe that a number of factors contribute to this fluctuation and may cause our 
table of contents stock price to decline in the future 
while it is not possible to foresee all of the events that could adversely affect the price of our common stock or cause such price to remain volatile  the factors include state and federal regulatory and legislative actions  general economic conditions and the condition of the telecommunications industry  our ability to maintain existing customers and add new customers and recognize revenue from distressed customers  our ability to execute our operational plan and reach profitability and cash flow positive from operations  our ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to fund our operations  adverse litigation results  announcements of new products  services or pricing by our competitors or the emergence of new competing technologies  our failure to meet the expectations of investors or of analysts  the adoption of new  or changes in existing  accounting rules  guidelines and practices  which may materially impact our financial statements and may materially alter the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the level of demand for broadband internet access services and voip telephony services  departures of key personnel  and effective internal controls over financial reporting 
the stock market has periodically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of common stock of technology companies 
these changes have often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may also negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
substantial leverage and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
refer to part ii  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for additional information we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of  interest on and other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness when due 
in particular  under certain circumstances we may be required to repay our existing  convertible notes payable to earthlink  our  in convertible notes and any amounts outstanding pursuant to our  senior secured credit facility with svb prior to the scheduled maturity dates for those loans 
we may also add equipment loans and lease lines to finance capital expenditures and may obtain additional long term debt  working capital lines of credit and leases  some of which may be on less than optimal terms 
our substantial leverage could have significant negative consequences  including increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  requiring the dedication of a portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes  including capital expenditures  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources

item legal proceedings several stockholders filed complaints in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  on behalf of themselves and purported classes of stockholders  against us and several former and current officers and directors in addition to some of the underwriters in our stock offerings 
these lawsuits are so called ipo allocation cases  challenging practices allegedly used by certain underwriters of public equity offerings during the late s and on april  the plaintiffs amended their complaint and removed us as a defendant 
certain directors and officers are still named in the complaint 
the plaintiffs claim that we and others failed to disclose the arrangements that some of these underwriters purportedly made with certain investors 
the plaintiffs and the other issuer defendants have reached a tentative agreement to settle the matter  and we believe the tentative settlement will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
that settlement  however  has not been finalized 
if the settlement is not finalized  we believe these officers and directors have strong defenses to these lawsuits and intend to contest them vigorously 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable and there is no guarantee these officers and directors will prevail 
in june  dhruv khanna was relieved of his duties as our general counsel and secretary 
shortly thereafter  mr 
khanna alleged that  over a period of years  certain current and former directors and officers had breached their fiduciary duties to the company by engaging in or approving actions that constituted waste and self dealing  that certain current and former directors and officers had provided false representations to our auditors and that he had been relieved of his duties in retaliation for his being a purported whistleblower and because of racial or national origin discrimination 
he threatened to file a shareholder derivative action against those current and former directors and officers  as well as a wrongful termination lawsuit 
mr 
khanna was placed on paid leave while his allegations were being investigated 
our board of directors appointed a special investigative committee  which initially consisted of l 
dale crandall and hellene runtagh  to investigate the allegations made by mr 
khanna 
richard jalkut was appointed to this committee shortly after he joined our board of directors 
this committee retained an independent law firm to assist in its investigation 
based on this investigation  the committee concluded that mr 
khanna s allegations were without merit and that it would not be in the best interests of the company to commence litigation based on these allegations 
the committee considered  among other things  that many of mr 
khanna s allegations were not accurate  that certain allegations challenged business decisions lawfully made by management or the board  that the transactions challenged by mr 
khanna in which any director had an interest were approved by a majority of disinterested directors in accordance with delaware law  that the challenged director and officer representations to the auditors were true and accurate  and that mr 
khanna was not relieved of his duties as a result of retaliation for alleged whistleblowing or racial or national origin discrimination 
mr 
khanna has disputed the committee s work and the outcome of its investigation 

table of contents after the committee s findings had been presented and analyzed  we concluded in january that it would not be appropriate to continue mr 
khanna on paid leave status  and determined that there was no suitable role for him at covad 
accordingly  he was terminated as an employee of covad 
based on the events mentioned above  in september  mr 
khanna filed a purported class action and a derivative lawsuit against our current and former directors in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county 
on august   mr 
khanna amended his complaint and two additional purported shareholders joined the lawsuit 
in this action the plaintiffs seek recovery on behalf of the company from the individual defendants for their purported breach of fiduciary duty 
the plaintiffs also seek to invalidate our election of directors in  and because they claim that our proxy statements were misleading 
on may   the court dismissed several of the claims for breach of fiduciary duty as well as the claims relating to our proxy statements 
the court also determined that mr 
khanna could no longer serve as a plaintiff in this matter 
the litigation with respect to the remaining claims is still pending  and we are unable to predict the outcome of this lawsuit 
we are also a party to a variety of other pending or threatened legal proceedings as either plaintiff or defendant  and are engaged in business disputes that arise in the ordinary course of business 
failure to resolve these various legal disputes and controversies without excessive delay and cost and in a manner that is favorable to us could significantly harm our business 
we do not believe the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
however  litigation is inherently unpredictable and there is no guarantee we will prevail or otherwise not be adversely affected 
we are subject to state public utility commission  fcc and other regulatory and court decisions as they relate to the interpretation and implementation of the telecommunications act 
in addition  we are engaged in a variety of legal negotiations  arbitrations and regulatory and court proceedings with multiple ilecs 
these negotiations  arbitrations and proceedings concern the telephone companies denial of central office space  the cost and delivery of transmission facilities and telephone lines and central office spaces  billing issues and other operational issues 
other than the payment of legal fees and expenses  which are not quantifiable but are expected to be material  we do not believe that these matters will result in material liability to us and the potential gains are not quantifiable at this time 
an unfavorable result in any of these negotiations  arbitrations and proceedings  however  could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows if we are denied or charged higher rates for transmission lines or central office spaces
