item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the company has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is the most significant accounting policy for the company 
the company recognizes revenue from time and material contracts as services are performed 
during the years ended december   and  revenues from time and material contracts constituted  and  respectively of total revenues 
revenue from fixed price  application management  and maintenance and support engagements is recognized as earned  which generally results in straight line revenue recognition as services are performed continuously over the term of the engagement 
during the years ended december   and  revenues from fixed price application management and support engagements constituted  and  respectively 
revenue on fixed price development projects is measured using the proportional performance method of accounting 
performance is generally measured based upon the efforts incurred to date in relation to the total estimated efforts to the completion of the contract 
the company monitors estimates of total contract revenues and cost on a routine basis throughout the delivery period 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimates of the contract revenues or costs is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
in the event that a loss is anticipated on a particular contract  provision is made for the estimated loss 
the company issues invoices related to fixed price contracts based on either the achievement of milestones during a project or other contractual terms 
differences between the timing of billings and the recognition of revenue based upon the proportional performance method of accounting are recorded as revenue earned in excess of billings or deferred revenue in the accompanying financial statements 
during the years ended december  and  revenues from fixed price development contracts constituted  and  respectively 
significant accounting estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition 
the use of the proportional performance method of accounting requires that the company make estimates about its future efforts and costs relative to the fixed price contracts 
while the company has procedures in place to monitor the estimates throughout the performance period  such estimates are subject to change as each contract progresses 
the cumulative impact of any such changes is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of aged receivables 
the provision for the allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
at december  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million respectively 
these estimates are based on our assessment of the probable collection from specific customer accounts  the aging of the accounts receivable  analysis of credit data  bad debt write offs  and other known factors 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates and reserves for tax contingencies 
when preparing our financial statements  the company records provisions for income taxes based on enacted tax laws and rates in the various taxing jurisdictions in which it operates 
in determining the tax provisions  the company also provides for tax contingencies based on the company s assessment of future regulatory reviews of filed tax returns 
such reserves  which are recorded in income taxes payable  are based on management s estimates and accordingly are subject to revision based on additional information 
the reserve no longer required for any particular tax year  is credited to the current year s income tax provision 
during  the company has reversed million of the accrual for income taxes related to the year and credited it to the current year s income tax provision 
the revision in estimates noted above had an after tax impact of increasing the diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  by per share 
during  the company has reversed million of the accrual for income taxes related to the year and credited it to the current year s income tax provision 
in addition  during the company has also reversed million related to the payroll tax provision and provided for valuation allowance of million attributable to certain deferred tax benefits  on write off of certain investments in  which are not expected to be materialized 
the revision in estimates noted above had an after tax impact of increasing the diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  by per share 
accruals for legal exposures 
the company estimates the costs associated with legal exposures that it has and the related legal expenses and records the probable liability if it can be reasonably estimated or otherwise  the lower end of an estimated range of potential liability 
the accrual related to litigation and legal fees at december  and  was million and million  respectively

on applications outsourcing engagements  the company typically assumes responsibility for engagement management and generally is able to allocate certain portions of the engagement to on site  off site and offshore personnel 
applications outsourcing revenues generally are recognized on either a time and materials or fixed price basis

in  state street bank also contributed of the company s total consolidated revenues 
although the company does not currently foresee a credit risk associated with accounts receivable from these customers  credit risk is affected by conditions or occurrences within the economy and the specific industries in which these customers operate 
as a result of the continued uncertainty and weakness in the global economic and political environment  companies continue to seek to outsource their it spending offshore 
however  the company also sees clients needs to reduce their costs and the increased competitive environment among it companies 
the company expects these conditions to continue in the next few quarters

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations

the company s exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company s investments are in high quality indian mutual funds and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
at any time  changes in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings for our investment portfolio 
the company strives to protect and preserve our invested funds by limiting default  market and reinvestment risk 
investments in interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if there is a decline in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  the company s future investment income may fall short of expectations  or the company may suffer a loss in principal if the company is forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates as stated above 
foreign currency risk the company s sales are primarily sourced in the united states and its subsidiary in the united kingdom and are mostly denominated in us dollars or uk pounds  respectively 
its foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the risk is partially mitigated as the company has sufficient resources in the respective local currencies to meet immediate requirements 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations
