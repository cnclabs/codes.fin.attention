item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  under the headings critical accounting estimates and assumptions  certain trends and uncertainties and elsewhere in md a 
we are impacted by the competitiveness of the markets in which we compete and market demand for coal 
we compete with coal producers in various regions of the us and overseas for domestic and international sales 
continued domestic demand for our coal and the prices that we will be able to obtain primarily will depend upon coal consumption patterns of the domestic electric utility industry and the domestic steel industry 
consumption by the domestic utility industry is affected by the demand for electricity  environmental and other governmental regulations  technological developments and the price of competing coal and alternative fuel supplies including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  including hydroelectric power 
consumption by the domestic steel industry is primarily affected by economic growth and the demand for steel used in construction as well as appliances and automobiles 
in recent years  the competitive environment for coal has been impacted by sustained growth in a number of the largest markets in the world  including the us  china  japan and india  where demand for both electricity and steel have supported pricing for steam and metallurgical coal 
the cost of ocean transportation and the valuation of the us dollar in relation to foreign currencies significantly impact the relative attractiveness of our coal as we compete on price with other foreign coal producing sources 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
portions of our coal reserves possess quality characteristics that enable us to mine  process and market them as either metallurgical coal or high quality steam coal  depending on the prevailing conditions in the metallurgical and steam coal industries 
a decline in the metallurgical market relative to the steam market could cause us to shift coal from the metallurgical market to the steam market 
if demand for metallurgical coal declined to the point where we could earn a more attractive return marketing the coal as steam coal  there could be a material impact on cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
demand for our coal depends on its price and quality and the cost of transporting it to customers 
coal prices are influenced by a number of factors and may vary dramatically by region 
the two principal components of the price of coal are the price of coal at the mine  which is influenced by mine operating costs and coal quality  and the cost of transporting coal from the mine to the point of use 
the cost of mining the coal is influenced by geologic characteristics such as seam thickness  overburden ratios and depth of underground reserves 
underground mining is generally more expensive than surface mining as a result of higher costs for labor including reserves for future costs associated with labor benefits and health care and capital costs including costs for mining equipment and construction of extensive ventilation systems 
as of january   we operated active underground mines  including longwall mines  and active surface mines  with highwall miners 
see item business  under the headings mining methods  mining operations and competition for further discussion 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on our ability to compete with other energy sources and on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
on the other hand  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
a significant decline in coal prices in general could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our results are highly dependent upon the prices we receive for our coal 
decreased demand for coal  both domestically and internationally  could cause spot prices and the prices we are able to negotiate on long term contracts to decline 
the lower prices could negatively affect our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition  if we are unable to increase productivity and or decrease costs in order to maintain our margins 

table of contents we depend on continued demand from our customers 
reduced demand from or the loss of our largest customers could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve projected revenue 
decreases in demand may result from  among other things  a reduction in consumption by the electric generation industry and or the steel industry  the availability of other sources of fuel at cheaper costs and a general slow down in the economy 
when our contracts with customers reach expiration  there can be no assurance that the customers either will extend or enter into new long term contracts or  in the absence of long term contracts  that they will continue to purchase the same amount of coal as they have in the past or on terms  including pricing terms  as favorable as under existing arrangements 
in the event that a large customer account is lost or a long term contract is not renewed  profits could suffer if alternative buyers are not willing to purchase our coal on comparable terms 
see item business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
the level of our indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to grow and compete and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our contracts and agreements 
at december   we had  million of total indebtedness outstanding  which represented of our total book capitalization 
we have significant debt  lease and royalty obligations 
our ability to satisfy debt service  lease and royalty obligations and to effect any refinancing of indebtedness will depend upon future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the markets that we serve as well as financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and future borrowings  or other financings may be unavailable in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service  lease and royalty payment obligations or our other liquidity needs 
our relative amount of debt could have material consequences to our business  including  but not limited to i making it more difficult to satisfy debt covenants and debt service  lease payments and other obligations  ii making it more difficult to pay quarterly dividends as we have in the past  iii increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  iv limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate requirements  v reducing the availability of cash flows from operations to fund acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  vi limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in the business and the industry in which we compete  or vii placing us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors with relatively lower amounts of debt 
the covenants in our credit facility and the indentures governing debt instruments impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility 
our asset based loan credit facility and the indentures governing our notes contain a number of significant restrictions and covenants that may limit our ability and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things i incur liens and debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other person  ii increase common stock dividends above specified levels  iii make loans and investments  iv prepay  redeem or repurchase debt  v engage in mergers  consolidations and asset dispositions  vi engage in affiliate transactions  vii create lien or security interests in any real property or equipment  viii engage in sale and leaseback transactions  and ix restrict distributions from subsidiaries 
operating results below current levels or other adverse factors  including a significant increase in interest rates  could result in us being unable to comply with certain debt covenants 
if we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers from our lenders  our debt under these agreements would be in default and could be accelerated by the lenders 
if the indebtedness is accelerated  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if we are able to obtain new financing  it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us 
if our debt is in default for any reason  our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of the notes and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions 
we depend on our ability to continue acquiring and developing economically recoverable coal reserves 
a key component our future success is our ability to continue acquiring coal reserves for development that have the geological characteristics that allow them to be economically mined 
replacement reserves may not be available or  if available  may not be capable of being mined at costs comparable to those characteristics of the depleting mines 
an inability to continue acquiring economically recoverable coal reserves could have a material impact on cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents we face numerous uncertainties in estimating economically recoverable coal reserves  and inaccuracies in estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by us 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  iii the effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties may vary substantially 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
defects in title or loss of any leasehold interests in our properties could limit our ability to mine these properties or result in significant unanticipated costs 
a significant portion of our mining operations occurs on properties that we lease 
title defects or the loss of leases could adversely affect our ability to mine the reserves covered by those leases 
our current practice is to obtain a title review from a licensed attorney prior to leasing property 
we generally have not obtained title insurance in connection with acquisitions of coal reserves 
in some cases  the seller or lessor warrants property title 
separate title confirmation sometimes is not required when leasing reserves where mining has occurred previously 
our right to mine some of our reserves may be adversely affected if defects in title or boundaries exist 
in order to obtain leases to conduct our mining operations on property where these defects exist  we may have to incur unanticipated costs 
in addition  we may not be able to successfully negotiate new leases for properties containing additional reserves  or maintain our leasehold interests in properties where we have not commenced mining operations during the term of the lease 
if the coal industry experiences overcapacity in the future  our profitability could be impaired 
the recent strong coal market and increased demand for coal has attracted new investors to the coal industry  spurring the development of new mines  and resulting in added production capacity throughout the industry 
several of our competitors have announced plans for substantial increases in productive capacity over the next several years  although recent weakness in coal pricing has led to the deferral of some of these projects 
a rebound in the price levels of coal could further encourage the development of expanded capacity by new or existing coal producers 
any resulting increases in capacity could further reduce coal prices and reduce our margins 
see item  business  under the heading competition  for further discussion 
decreased availability or increased costs of key equipment  supplies or commodities such as diesel fuel  steel  explosives and tires could decrease our profitability 
our operations are dependant on reliable supplies of mining equipment  replacement parts  explosives  diesel fuel  tires  and steel related products including roof bolts 
if the cost of any mining equipment or key supplies increases significantly  or if they should become unavailable due to higher industry wide demand or less production by suppliers  there could be an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
in the past two years  industry wide demand growth has exceeded supply growth for certain surface and underground mining equipment and heavy equipment tires 
transportation disruptions could impair our ability to sell coal 
we are dependent on our transportation providers to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lockouts or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers 
in recent years  our ability to ship coal has been negatively impacted by a reduction in available and timely rail service 
lack of sufficient resources to meet the rapid increase in demand  a greater demand for transportation to export terminals and rail line congestion all seem to have contributed to the disruption and slowdowns in rail service 
although the railroads continue to take action to remedy these issues  including the purchase of new locomotives and railcars  and the hiring and training of additional crews  such actions may not be sufficient to cure the disruption and slowdowns in rail service 

table of contents severe weather may affect our ability to mine and deliver coal 
severe weather  including flooding and excessive ice or snowfall  when it occurs  can adversely affect our ability to produce  load and transport coal  which may negatively impact cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
federal and state government regulations applicable to operations increase costs and may make our coal less competitive than other coal producers 
we incur substantial costs and liabilities under increasingly strict federal  state and local environmental  health and safety and endangered species laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens  the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations  the suspension or revocation of permits and other enforcement measures that could have the effect of limiting production from our operations 
we may also incur costs and liabilities resulting from claims for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations 
see item business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion of this risk 
new legislation and new regulations may be adopted which could materially adversely affect our mining operations  cost structure or our customers ability to use coal 
new legislation and new regulations may also require us  as well as our customers  to change operations significantly or incur increased costs 
the epa has undertaken broad initiatives aimed at increasing compliance with emissions standards and to provide incentives to our customers for decreasing emissions  often by switching to an alternative fuel source or by installing scrubbers at their coal fired plants 
msha or other federal or state regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers demands 
msha or other federal or state regulatory agencies may order certain of our mines to be temporarily or permanently closed 
our customers may challenge our issuance of force majeure notices in connection with such closures 
if these challenges are successful  we may have to purchase coal from third party sources to satisfy those challenges  negotiate settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  terminate customers contracts or face claims initiated by our customers against us 
the resolution of these challenges could have an adverse impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
we must obtain governmental permits and approvals for mining operations  which can be a costly and time consuming process and can result in restrictions on our operations 
our operations are principally regulated under surface mining permits issued pursuant to the smcra and state counterpart laws 
such permits are issued for terms of five years with the right of successive renewal 
additionally  the clean water act requires permits for operations that fill waters of the us valley fills and refuse impoundments are typically authorized under nationwide permits that are revised and renewed periodically by the us army corps of engineers 
additionally  certain surface mines and preparation plants have permits issued pursuant to the clean air act and state counterpart clean air laws allowing and controlling the discharge of air pollutants 
regulatory authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing of permit issuance 
requirements imposed by these authorities may be costly and time consuming and may result in delays in the commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
see item  business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
the loss of key personnel or the failure to attract qualified personnel could affect our ability to operate our company effectively 
the successful management of our business is dependent on a number of key personnel 
our future success will be affected by our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there are no assurances that key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future 
failure to retain or attract key personnel could have an adverse affect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
union represented labor creates an increased risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs 
at december   of our total workforce was represented by the umwa 
six of our coal preparation plants and one smaller surface mine have a workforce that is represented by the umwa 
in  these six preparation plants handled approximately of our coal production 
there may be an increased risk of strikes and other related work actions  in addition to higher labor costs  associated with these operations 
if some or all of our current open shop operations were to become union represented  we could be subject to additional risk of work stoppages and higher labor costs  which could adversely affect the stability of production and reduce net income 

table of contents we are subject to being adversely affected by a decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of our customers 
in an effort to mitigate credit related risks in all customer classifications  we maintain a credit policy  which requires scheduled reviews of customer creditworthiness and continuous monitoring of customer news events that might have an impact on their financial condition 
negative credit performance or events may trigger the application of tighter terms of sale  requirements for collateral or  ultimately  a suspension of credit privileges 
the creditworthiness of customers can limit who we can do business with and at what price 
we have contracts to supply coal to energy trading and brokering companies who resell the coal to the ultimate users 
we are subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition and creditworthiness of these energy trading and brokering companies 
in addition  as the largest supplier of metallurgical coal to the american steel industry  we are subject to being adversely affected by any decline in the financial condition or production volume of american steel producers 
see item  business  under the heading customers and coal contracts for further discussion 
we are subject to various legal proceedings  which may have a material effect on our business 
we are parties to a number of legal proceedings incident to normal business activities 
some of the allegations brought against us are with merit  while others are not 
there is always the potential that an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
see item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
we have significant reclamation and mine closure obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are materially inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering expertise related to these requirements 
the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed periodically by management and engineers 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
see item business  under the heading environmental  safety and health laws and regulations for further discussion 
our future expenditures for postretirement benefit and pension obligations could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions are incorrect 
we are subject to long term liabilities under a variety of benefit plans and other arrangements with current and former employees 
these obligations have been estimated based on actuarial assumptions  including actuarial estimates  assumed discount rates  estimates of life expectancy  expected returns on pension plan assets and changes in healthcare costs 
if our assumptions relating to these benefits change in the future or are incorrect  we may be required to record additional expenses  which would reduce our profitability 
in addition  future regulatory and accounting changes relating to these benefits could result in increased obligations or additional costs  which could also have a material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
for a further discussion  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the heading critical accounting estimates and assumptions and notes and to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions we undertake  as acquisitions entail a number of inherent risks 
from time to time we expand our business and reserve position through acquisitions of businesses and assets  mergers  joint ventures or other transactions 
such transactions involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental liabilities of  acquisition or other transaction candidates  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale 

table of contents any one or more of these and other factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets or could result in unexpected liabilities associated with these acquisitions 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad 
we rely on customers in other countries for a portion of our sales  with shipments to countries in north america  south america  europe  asia and africa 
we compete in these international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets 
terrorist attacks and threats  escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or acts of war may negatively affect our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
our business is affected by general economic conditions  fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending  and market liquidity  which can decline as a result of numerous factors outside of our control  such as terrorist attacks and acts of war 
future terrorist attacks against us targets  rumors or threats of war  actual conflicts involving the us or its allies  or military or trade disruptions affecting customers may materially adversely affect operations 
as a result  there could be delays or losses in transportation and deliveries of coal to customers  decreased sales of coal and extension of time for payment of accounts receivable from customers 
strategic targets such as energy related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the us in addition  such disruption may lead to significant increases in energy prices that could result in government imposed price controls 
it is possible that any  or a combination  of these occurrences could have a material impact on cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
coal mining is subject to inherent risks  some of which we insure against and some of which we self insure 
our operations are subject to certain events and conditions that could disrupt operations  including fires and explosions  accidental minewater discharges  natural disasters  equipment failures  maintenance problems and flooding 
we maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some  but not all  of these risks 
even where insurance coverage applies  there can be no assurance that these risks would be fully covered by insurance policies 
we self insure our highwall miners and underground equipment  including our longwalls 
we do not currently carry business interruption insurance

coal reserves we estimate that  as of december   we had total recoverable reserves of approximately billion tons consisting of both proven and probable reserves 
reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as that part of a mineral deposit  which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination 
recoverable reserves means coal that is economically recoverable using existing equipment and methods under federal and state laws currently in effect 
approximately billion tons of reserves are classified as proven reserves 
proven measured reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops  trenches  workings or drill holes  grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection  sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size  shape  depth and mineral content of reserves are well established 
the remaining billion tons of our reserves are classified as probable reserves 
probable reserves are defined by the sec industry guide as reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proven measured reserves  but the sites for inspection  sampling  and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced 
the degree of assurance  although lower than that for proven measured reserves  is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our internal engineers  geologists and finance associates 
reserve estimates are updated annually using geologic data taken from drill holes  adjacent mine workings  outcrop prospect openings and other sources 
coal tonnages are categorized according to coal quality  seam thickness  mineability and location relative to existing mines and infrastructure 
in accordance with applicable industry standards  proven reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced no more than  feet apart 
probable reserves are those for which reliable data points are spaced  feet to  feet apart 
further scrutiny is applied using geological criteria and other factors related to profitable extraction of the coal 
these criteria include seam height  roof and floor conditions  yield and marketability 
as with most coal producing companies in central appalachia  the majority of our coal reserves are controlled pursuant to leases from third party landowners 
these leases convey mining rights to the coal producer in exchange for a per ton or percentage of gross sales price royalty payment to the lessor 
however  approximately of our reserve holdings are owned and require no royalty or per ton payment to other parties 
royalty expense for coal reserves from our producing properties owned and leased was approximately of produced coal revenue for the year ended december

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we operate coal mines and processing facilities in central appalachia  which generate revenues and cash flow through the mining  processing and selling of steam and metallurgical grade coal  primarily of a low sulfur content 
we also generate income and cash flow through other coal related businesses  including the management of material handling facilities and a synfuel production plant 
other revenue is obtained from royalties  rentals  gas well revenues  gains on the sale of non strategic assets  and miscellaneous income 
for the year ended december   approximately of produced tons sold were to us electricity generators  were to steel manufacturers in the us and abroad  and were to the us industrial sector 
we reported net income for the year ended december  of million  or per basic share  compared to net loss for of million  or per basic share 
net income in included pre tax gains totaling approximately million million after tax or per diluted share related to the sale of our falcon reserves 
included in the loss was an after tax charge of million  or per basic share related to a capital restructuring 
results in also included gains totaling approximately million after tax or per basic share related to the sale of our ownership interest in the property known as big elk mining company and a non cash exchange of coal reserves 
produced tons sold were million in  compared to million in shipments were negatively affected during the year by productivity issues at underground mines  including the loss of six months of production from our logan county resource group s aracoma longwall mine due to a fire in january and geological difficulties at several underground mines  especially at our revolution and rockhouse longwall mines located at our independence and sidney resource groups  respectively 
we also continued to experience railroad congestion due to heightened coal demand and a lack of rail cars and a tight labor market that lead to high turnover and inexperienced workers 
we produced million tons during  compared to million tons produced in exports decreased to million tons compared to million tons exported in in an effort to better manage our production in to adjust to the changing coal markets  we closed several low margin coal mines  including our rockhouse longwall and replaced some of the production capacity by adding a dragline at our twilight surface mine and purchasing new  more productive surface and underground mine equipment 
during  produced coal revenue increased by over the prior year on fewer tons shipped as we benefited from higher prices secured in new agreements as lower priced contracts expired 
these higher priced contracts were negotiated during a period of strong economic growth in china  india  the us and other regions of the world  during which a worldwide shortage of certain grades of coal existed  stockpile inventories at utilities were low  and the cost of natural gas and oil was high 
as progressed  spot coal prices dropped as a warm winter and relatively mild summer weather in the us allowed utilities to rebuild their stockpiles and lowered the price of natural gas  resulting in natural gas storage injections that reached record levels 
our average produced coal revenue per ton sold in increased by to compared to in and by over a five year period compared to in our average produced coal revenue per ton in for metallurgical tons sold increased by to from in we experienced a significant increase in costs during the past year period  with average cash cost per ton sold increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal a reconciliation of these non gaap figures is presented in footnote of item selected financial data 
the increased cost level is mainly due to increased sales related costs resulting from the growth in average per ton realization  materially higher supply costs  including diesel fuel  steel  copper and explosives  higher labor and benefit costs  and lower operating productivity  as discussed above 
in june  congress passed and president bush signed the miner act  which  among other things  requires mine specific emergency response plans  enhanced communication systems  and more available mine rescue teams  as well as larger penalties by msha for noncompliance by mine operators 
in december  msha similarly passed its final rule on emergency mine evacuation  which includes requirements for increased availability and storage of scsrs  improved emergency evacuation drills and scsr training  and the installation and maintenance of lifelines in underground coal mines 
coal producing states  including west virginia and kentucky  passed similar legislation in while the full cost of compliance remains unknown  we spent over million in and estimate that we will spend a total of million to million over two to three years to fully comply with these laws 
these costs were capitalized in net property  plant and equipment for

table of contents contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations that are recorded as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
other obligations  such as certain purchase commitments  operating lease agreements  and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities within the consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed 
the following table is a summary of our significant obligations as of december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
the table does not include current liabilities accrued within the consolidated financial statements  such as accounts payable and payroll and employee benefits 
payments due by period in thousands total within year years years beyond years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations coal lease obligations other purchase obligations total obligations long term debt obligations reflect the future interest and principal payments of our fixed rate senior unsecured notes outstanding as of december  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
capital lease obligations include the amount of imputed interest over the terms of the leases 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
coal lease obligations include minimum royalties paid on leased coal rights 
certain coal leases do not have set expiration dates but extend until completion of mining of all merchantable and mineable coal reserves 
for purposes of this table  we have generally assumed that minimum royalties on such leases will be paid for a period of years 
other purchase obligations primarily include capital expenditure commitments for surface mining and other equipment as well as purchases of materials and supplies 
we have purchase agreements with vendors for most types of operating expenses 
however  our open purchase orders which are not recognized as a liability until the purchased items are received under these purchase agreements  combined with any other open purchase orders  are not material and are excluded from this table 
other purchase obligations also include contractual commitments under transportation contracts 
since the actual tons to be shipped under these contracts are not set and will vary  the amount included in the table reflects the minimum payment obligations required by the contracts 
additionally  we have liabilities relating to pension and other postretirement benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  the estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements and in critical accounting estimates and assumptions of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  operating leases  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets  and  except for the operating leases  which are discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  we do not expect any material impact on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
we use surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments  and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   we had million of outstanding surety bonds 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment and collection bonds of million  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
generally  the availability and market terms of surety bonds continue to be challenging 
if we are unable to meet certain financial tests  or to the extent that surety bonds otherwise become unavailable  we would need to replace the surety bonds or seek to secure them with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
as of december   we had secured million of surety obligations with letters of credit 
from time to time we use bank letters of credit to secure obligations for worker s compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
the office of workers claims for the commonwealth of kentucky has applied a new actuarial methodology for deriving surety obligations for existing claims  which has resulted in an assessment of an additional million of surety 
we have protested the assessment and  pending final resolution of the protest  the requirement for additional surety has been stayed 
any additional surety that is ultimately required will likely be satisfied with a bank letter of credit 
at december   we had million of letters of credit outstanding including the million noted above that secure surety obligations  of which million was collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts pledged to issuing banks and million was issued under our asset based lending arrangement 
no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit as of december  certain trends and uncertainties our inability to satisfy contractual obligations may adversely affect profitability 
from time to time  we have disputes with customers over the provisions of sales agreements relating to  among other things  coal pricing  quality  quantity  delays and force majeure declarations 
our inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in the purchase of coal from third party sources to satisfy those obligations  the negotiation of settlements with customers  which may include price reductions  the reduction of commitments or the extension of the time for delivery  and customers terminating contracts  declining to do future business with us  or initiating claims against us 
we may not be able to resolve all of these disputes in a satisfactory manner  which could result in the payment of substantial damages or otherwise harm our relationships with our customers 
we are subject to being adversely affected by the potential inability to renew or obtain surety bonds 
federal and state laws require bonds to secure our obligations to reclaim lands used for mining  to pay federal and state workers compensation  and to satisfy other miscellaneous obligations 
these bonds are typically renewable annually 
surety bond issuers and holders may not continue to renew the bonds or may demand additional collateral upon those renewals 
we are also subject to increased in the amount of surety bonds required by federal and state laws as these laws change or the interpretation of these laws changes 
our failure to maintain  or inability to acquire  surety bonds that are required by state and federal law would have a material impact on us 
that failure could result from a variety of factors including the following i lack of availability  higher expense or unfavorable market terms of new bonds  ii restrictions on availability of collateral for current and future third party surety bond issuers under the terms of our senior notes or revolving credit facilities  iii our inability to meet certain financial tests with respect to a portion of the post mining reclamation bonds  and iv the exercise by third party surety bond issuers of their right to refuse to renew or issue new bonds 
high oil prices could lead to a phase out of irc section k tax credits formerly section  which would reduce our earnings from our operating and financial arrangements with a synfuel facility we previously owned and currently manage 
owners of facilities that produce synthetic fuels can qualify for tax credits under the provisions of irc section k formerly section section k 
in and  we sold most of our interest in a synfuel facility and subsequently entered into an agreement to manage the facility 
as part of the compensation for the sale  we received a contingent promissory note that is paid on a cents per section k credit dollar earned based on synfuel tonnage shipped through the payments to be received under the 
table of contents contingent promissory note may be reduced or eliminated if the price of oil remains above a certain threshold price set by the irs the threshold price 
once the threshold price is reached  the section k credits will be phased out ratably over a per barrel range above the threshold price 
the threshold price for was set by the irs in april and at a level where there was no phase out of section k tax credits 
the threshold price for is expected to be set by the irs in april for fiscal year  the average price of west texas intermediate crude oil was approximately per barrel 
at this price level a portion of the section k credits for will likely be phased out  which reduced the amount of income we accrued in from payments to be received under the contingent promissory note 
if the price of oil rises too high in  the majority owner of the synfuel facility may decide to close the facility  which would eliminate all of our future earnings from our operating and financial arrangements with the synfuel facility 
shortages of skilled labor in the central appalachian coal industry may pose a risk in achieving high levels of productivity at competitive costs 
coal mining continues to be a labor intensive industry 
in recent years  we have experienced a shortage of experienced mine workers when the demand and prices for all specifications of coal we mine increased appreciably 
the hiring of these less experienced workers has negatively impacted our productivity and cash costs 
a continued lack of skilled miners could continue to have an adverse impact on our labor productivity and cost and our ability to meet current production requirements to fulfill existing sales commitments or to expand production to meet the increased demand for coal 
fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for coal 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make coal a less competitive source of energy 
such increases could have a material impact on our ability to compete with other energy sources and on our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
conversely  significant decreases in transportation costs could result in increased competition from coal producers in other parts of the country or the world  including coal imported into the us several us ports have recently announced plans to increase their capacity to import coal 
for instance  coal mines in the western us could become an increasingly attractive source of coal to consumers in the eastern part of the country if the costs of transporting coal from the west were significantly reduced and rail capacity was increased 
inflationary pressures on supplies and labor may adversely affect our profit margins 
generally  inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years 
however  over the course of the last two years  we have been significantly impacted by price inflation in many of the components of our cost of produced coal revenue  such as fuel  steel  copper and labor 
for instance  the prices of diesel fuel and copper increased approximately and  respectively  over the two year period ending december  if the prices for which we sell our coal do not increase in step with rising costs  our profit margins will be reduced 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
significant changes to the estimates and assumptions used in determining certain liabilities described below could introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension the estimated cost and benefits of non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with management s review and approval  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the applicable liabilities could be effectively settled as of the measurement date 
in estimating the discount rate  forecasted cash flows were discounted using each year s associated spot interest rate on high quality fixed income investments 
at december  and  the discount rate used to determine defined benefit pension liability was and  respectively 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon our long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels used was for the years ended december  and the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets is based on long term historical return information and future estimates of long term investment returns for the target asset allocation of investments that comprise plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was   and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a decrease in the expected rate of return assumption increases the defined benefit pension expense

table of contents coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
an annual evaluation is prepared by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by management  use various assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs trend  cost of living trend  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
we record expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the black lung liability was and  respectively 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a medical cost trend and cost of living trend sensitivity analysis 
workers compensation our operations have workers compensation coverage through a combination of either self insurance  participation in a state run program  or commercial insurance 
we accrue for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability we utilize the services of third party administrators who derive claim reserves from historical experience 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with management with regards to actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured liabilities 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the self insured workers compensation liability obligation was 
a decrease in the assumed discount rate increases the workers compensation self insured liability and related expense 
actual experience in settling these liabilities could differ from these estimates  which could increase our costs 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on workers compensation 
other postretirement benefits our sponsored health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
we pay costs as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of the retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  after review and approval by massey management  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs 
at december  and december   the discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit liability was and  respectively 
at december   our assumptions of the company health care plans cost trend were projected at an annual rate of ranging down to by ranging down to by at december   and remaining level thereafter 
included in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements is a sensitivity analysis on the health care trend rate assumption 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the smcra establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and engineering estimates related to these requirements 
we account for our reclamation liabilities under sfas sfas requires that asset retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on fair value  which is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
management and engineers periodically review the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability and the expected period in which reclamation work will be performed 
in estimating future cash flows  we considered the estimated current cost of reclamation and applied inflation rates and a third party profit  as necessary 
the third party profit is an estimate of the approximate markup that would be charged by contractors for work performed on our behalf 
the discount rate applied is based on the rates of treasury bonds with maturities similar to the estimated future cash flow  adjusted for our credit standing 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
contingencies we are parties to a number of other legal proceedings  incident to our normal business activities 
these matters include contract disputes  personal injury  property damage and employment matters 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings  based on our current estimates  we do not believe that any liability arising from these matters individually or in the aggregate should have a material impact upon our consolidated cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
however  it is reasonably possible that the ultimate liabilities in the future with respect to these lawsuits and claims may be material to our cash flows  results of operations or financial condition 
see item legal proceedings and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our contingencies 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in evaluating the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from the assumptions made in the evaluation of our valuation allowance  we record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
we have a reserve for taxes that may become payable as a result of audits in future periods with respect to previously filed tax returns included in other noncurrent liabilities separate disclosure has not been made because the amount is not considered material 
it is our policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities 
we establish the reserves based upon management s assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences ie  tax depletion expense  etc  tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments 
the tax reserves are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the reserve 
we are currently under audit from the irs for the fiscal year ended october  and calendar years ended december  and management believes that we have adequately provided for any income taxes and interest that may ultimately be paid with respect to all open tax years 
coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our internal engineers  geologists and financial associates 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include i geological conditions  ii historical production from similar areas with similar conditions  iii the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  iv assumptions governing future prices  and v future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
stock options prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  as amended apb no 

generally no stock based employee compensation cost for stock options was reflected in net income as all options granted under the plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r eliminates the option of using the intrinsic value method of accounting previously available under apb no 
 and requires companies to recognize in the financial statements the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
we recorded stock option expense of million  pre tax  in selling  general and administrative in  as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
we anticipate the future expense of sfas r to approximate current year expense 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date 
various inputs are utilized in the black scholes pricing model  such as stock price on measurement date  exercise price defined in the award  expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts  risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate  expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior  and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of our stock and public peer group stock 

table of contents these factors can significantly impact the value of stock option expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk our net interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
at december   the outstanding  million of our debt was under fixed rate instruments 
upon the termination of our million interest rate swap agreement in december  our interest expense is no longer sensitive to changes in the general level of short term interest rates 
however  if it should become necessary to borrow under our asset based revolving credit facility  those borrowings would be made at a variable rate 
interest income is sensitive to changes in short term interest rates 
assuming that cash and cash equivalents was fixed at the december  level of million  a hypothetical basis point decrease in money market interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in interest income 
we manage market price risk for coal through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of one year or more in duration  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
we estimate that the percentage of sales pursuant to these long term contracts was for our fiscal year ended december  we anticipate that in  the percentage of our sales pursuant to long term contracts will be comparable with the percentage of our sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of our sales that are subject to these long term agreements  we have less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts typically allow the customer to elect volume flexibility  our ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or our exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons
