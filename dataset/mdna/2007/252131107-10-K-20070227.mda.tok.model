overview we are a medical device company focused on the design  development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring systems for people with diabetes 
on march   we received approval from the us food and drug administration  or fda  for our short term continuous glucose monitoring system  or sts 
we commenced initial commercial shipments of our sts throughout the united states on march  our approval allows for the use of our sts by adults with diabetes to detect trends and track glucose patterns  to aid in the detection of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia and to facilitate acute and long term therapy adjustments 
our sts is indicated for use as an adjunctive device to complement  not replace  information obtained from standard home blood glucose monitoring devices 
our sts must be prescribed by a physician and includes a disposable sensor  a transmitter and a small cell phone sized receiver 
the sensor is inserted by the patient and is intended to be used continuously up to three days after which it is removed and may be replaced by a new sensor 
our sts transmitter and receiver are reusable 
since inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to start up activities  raising capital and research and development  including product design  testing  manufacturing and clinical trials 
more recently  we have devoted considerable resources for the commercialization of our sts  as well as the continued development of our technology platform and future generations of products 
to support our national product launch  we have built a direct sales organization to call on endocrinologists  physicians and diabetes educators who can educate and influence patient adoption of continuous glucose monitoring 
to complement our direct sales efforts  we also employ clinical specialists who educate and provide clinical support in the field 
we are leveraging our technology platform to enhance the capabilities of our sts and develop additional continuous glucose monitoring products 
we filed a pma supplement in the second quarter of for approval of our next generation sts  which is expected to used continuously for up to seven days 
in october  we received a written request from the fda for additional information  and in november we responded to that request 
we are currently awaiting additional questions or a decision from the fda for this pma supplement 
we are continuing clinical development of a third generation sts which we expect will further improve sensor reliability  stability and accuracy over the useful life of the sensor  may be calibrated using any brand of home blood glucose meter  and will be more comfortable for patients to wear 
we also intend to seek approval for a pediatric indication patients under years of age for our sts product platform in the future 
we are also developing a product platform specifically for the in hospital glucose monitoring market  with an initial focus on a sensor specifically for the critical care market 
we conducted initial human feasibility studies for this product in the first quarter of our clinical trials may be delayed due to scheduling issues with patients and investigators  institutional review boards  sensor performance and manufacturing supply constraints  among other factors 
support of these clinical trials requires significant resources in research and development  manufacturing  quality assurance  and clinical and regulatory personnel 
even if our development and clinical trial efforts are successful  the fda may not approve our products  and if approved  we may not achieve acceptance in the marketplace by physicians and patients 
we currently manufacture our devices at our headquarters in san diego  california  and a new facility located nearby 
in these facilities we have approximately  square feet of laboratory space and  square feet of controlled environment rooms 
in january  both our facilities were subject to a post approval pma and qsr audit by the fda 
based on the results of this inspection  we believe we are in substantial compliance with the regulatory requirements for a commercial medical device manufacturer and there were no major observations from the fda resulting from this audit 
at the close of the inspection  the fda issued a form identifying several inspectional observations and  although we have no formal requirements or obligations to provide anything further to the fda regarding these observations  we intend to voluntarily provide formal written evidence to the fda of our actions taken to address these minor observations as soon as practical 
we manufacture our sts with components supplied by outside vendors and with parts manufactured by us internally 
key components that we manufacture internally include our wire based sensor for our sts 
the remaining components and assemblies are purchased from outside vendors 
we then assemble  test  package and ship the finished product  which includes a transmitter  a receiver and a disposable sensor 
we are expanding our manufacturing capacity in our two facilities in san diego  california 
our capacity expansion could be constrained by the lack of material availability  equipment design  production and validation  regulatory approval of our new facility  personnel staffing and other factors 
revenues are generated from sales of our sts transmitter and receiver and from the recurring sales of disposable sensors 
the disposable sensor is inserted by the patient and intended to be used continuously for up to three days  after which it may be replaced with a new disposable sensor 
our sts transmitter and receiver are reusable 
in the event we establish an installed base of patients using our sts  we expect to generate an increasing portion of our revenues through recurring sales of our disposable sensors 
we recognize revenue on our products upon shipment and our sales terms provide for customer payment at the time of order 
through december   we had generated million of revenue  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in may through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect our losses to continue and increase as we expand our clinical trial activities and continue commercialization activities 
we have financed our operations primarily through offerings of equity securities 
in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
as of december   we had million in borrowings under our loan and security agreement 
in may we completed a follow on offering of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
financial operations revenue through december   we generated million in revenue from the sale of our continuous glucose monitoring systems after launching our system on march  we expect that revenues we generate from the sales of our sts will fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
cost of sales cost of sales includes direct labor and material costs related to each product sold or produced including assembly and test labor and scrap  as well as factory overhead supporting our manufacturing operations 
factory overhead includes facilities  material procurement and control  manufacturing engineering  quality control  supervision and management 
these costs are primarily salary  fringe benefits  stock based compensation  facility expense  supplies and purchased services 
the majority of our costs are currently fixed due to the relatively low production volumes compared to our potential capacity 
from our inception until december   all of our manufacturing costs were included in research and development expense due to our development stage 
from january  these costs are included in cost of sales 
research and development our research and development expenses primarily consist of engineering and research expenses related to our continuous glucose monitoring technology  clinical trials  regulatory expenses  materials and products for clinical trials 
until december  our manufacturing costs were included in research and development expense 
research and development expenses are primarily related to employee compensation  including salary  fringe benefits  recruitment  stock based compensation  relocation and temporary employee expenses 
we also incur significant expenses to operate our clinical trials including trial design  clinical site reimbursement  data management  clinical trial product and associated travel expenses 
our research and development expenses also include fees for design services  contractors and development materials 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to support the development and clinical trials of additional products 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salary  fringe benefits and stock based compensation for our executive  financial  sales  marketing and administrative functions 
other significant expenses include trade show expenses  sales samples  insurance  professional fees for our outside legal counsel and independent auditors  litigation expenses and expenses for board meetings 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to support the commercialization of our sts platform 
results of operations fiscal year ending december  compared to december  revenue  cost of sales and gross margin 
we recorded revenues of million for the twelve months ending december  after launching our first product on march  no revenues were recorded in cost of sales increased million to million for the twelve months ending december  compared to zero for the twelve months ending december  the million of cost of sales for the twelve months ending december  reflects a million increase compared to the million of these expenses that were included in research and development expense during included in the costs were a charge of million to write down component inventory to the lower of cost or market value 
the increase in fiscal year cost of sales in was primarily related to variable costs to produce our revenues including a million increase in compensation expense  million in increased scrap and million in increased depreciation  offset by million in lower expensed materials and a benefit of million for materials purchased in and utilized in research and development 
research and development expense  including stock based compensation  decreased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in development expenses increased million and clinical and regulatory costs increased million and these increases were more than offset by a million decrease in manufacturing expenses that are now classified in cost of sales for changes in research and development and clinical expenses were driven by million in increased compensation expenses  and  in increased facility and depreciation costs  partially offset by million in lower outside design costs 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense  including stock based compensation  increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to million in higher sales and marketing costs and million in higher administrative costs 
changes in selling  general and administrative expense were driven by million in increased compensation costs  primarily in sales and marketing where we have hired a direct sales force in  million in increased advertising and promotions and million in increased legal expenses 
interest income and expense  net 
interest income and expense  net  increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was due to higher combined average cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities balances due to our april follow on public offering partially offset by  in interest expense on our bank equipment line 
fiscal year ending december  compared to december  revenue 
we generated no revenue during or research and development 
research and development expense  including stock based compensation  increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily related to million in increased manufacturing expenses  million in higher development costs and million in increased clinical and regulatory expense as we scaled our operations after completing our approval support trial and submitting our pma to the fda 
included in the higher r d spending were million in higher material procurements which includes a million loss on firm purchase commitments  million in increased salary  fringe and temporary employee expenses  million in greater product and tooling design costs  million in higher clinical trial expense and million in increased depreciation 
to date  we have expensed purchases of materials  some of which may be used to generate product sales  if and when we receive fda approval 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense  including stock based compensation  increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to million in initial marketing costs  million related to expenses associated with operating as a public company  and increased litigation expenses 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income increased million to million for the twelve months ended december   compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase was due to higher combined average cash  cash equivalents  and short term marketable securities balances due to our april ipo along with higher interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources we are in the early commercialization stage and have incurred losses since our inception in may as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and had working capital of million  which included million in cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities 
we have funded our operations primarily from the sale of equity securities and our bank line  raising aggregate net proceeds of million from equity sales through december  in april  we completed our initial public offering in which we sold  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
on march   we entered into a loan and security agreement that provides for a loan of up to million to finance various equipment purchases 
as of december  we had drawn million under our bank equipment loan 
on may  we completed the sale of  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
net cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period in the increase in cash used in operations was primarily due to a million increase in our net loss and million in lower accounts payable and accrued liabilities  as well as million in higher inventories  partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation and a million increase in depreciation  which are non cash expenses 
net cash used in investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period of the increase was primarily due to million in net purchases and sales of short term marketable securities as we invested the proceeds from our follow on offering 
for the twelve months ending december   we invested million in equipment and facilities to support manufacturing capacity increases and sales and marketing expansion  a decrease of million compared to the million invested in net cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities increased  to million for the twelve months ending december   compared to million for the same period of the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchases 
the proceeds from our follow on offering and our bank line draws in were approximately equal to our ipo proceeds 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we recently commercialized our first product  the sts continuous glucose monitoring system 
however  we anticipate that we will continue to incur net losses for the next several years as we incur expenses to commercialize our sts  develop new continuous glucose monitoring products  and expand our sales  marketing  manufacturing and corporate infrastructure 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities balances  and the interest we earn on these balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements with respect to the commercial launch of our sts  clinical trials  pma applications and to meet our other anticipated cash needs for if our available cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities and the funds available under our loan and security agreement are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain an additional credit facility 
the sale of additional equity and debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we may require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay or eliminate some or all of our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could harm our business 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of continuous glucose monitoring technologies  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current research and development and commercialization efforts 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to the revenue generated by sales of our sts and other future products  the expenses we incur in manufacturing  developing  selling and marketing our products  the quality levels of our products and services  potential reimbursement to purchasers of our products by third party payors  our ability to efficiently scale our manufacturing operations to meet demand for our current and any future products  the costs to produce our monitoring systems  the costs and timing of additional regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  including  but not limited to  defending the patent infringement lawsuit filed against us by abbott  the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities  the success of our research and development efforts  the emergence of competing or complementary technological developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the acquisition of businesses  products and technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
contractual obligations in march  the company entered into a loan and security agreement that provides for a loan of up to million to finance various equipment and leasehold improvement purchases through march as of december   there was an outstanding balance of million on our loan and million available for future borrowings that must be accessed by march  we are required to repay the outstanding balance in monthly installments beginning april until september in april  we entered into an office lease agreement for approximately  square feet of additional facilities located near our headquarters in san diego  ca 
we also have a five year option to renew the lease upon the expiration of the initial term 
in connection with the lease  we entered into a  letter of credit to secure future payments under the lease and paid a security deposit in the amount of  in april excluding real estate taxes and operating costs  we are required to make future monthly payments as of december through april totaling million 
our facility leases have annual rental escalation clauses and are expensed on a straight line basis 
we are party to various purchase arrangements related to components used in production and research and development activities 
as of december   the company had purchase commitments with certain vendors totaling approximately million due within one year 
there are no purchase commitments due beyond one year 
the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years notes payable operating leases royalty obligations purchase commitments total off balance sheet arrangements we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities 
related party transactions our chairman is a director of oracle corporation 
we incurred costs totaling   and  relating to an oracle erp system for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the chairman was not involved in the selection of the company s erp system 
we believe that the aforementioned arrangement was at no less favorable rates to us than those that could have been obtained from unrelated third parties based on review of price quotations with third parties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in our annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to a full understanding and evaluation of our reported financial results 
share based compensation our share based employee compensation plans are described in note to our financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under apb and sfas  for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the securities and exchange commission issued sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year our statement of operations as of and for the year ended december  reflects the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s statements of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  was  share based compensation expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  was related to the grant of certain options to employees during which represented the difference between the fair value of the common stock and the option exercise price at the date of grant accounted for in accordance with apb as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding options that is expected to be recognized as a component of our operating expenses through compensation costs will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
prior to january   we had adopted the disclosure only provision of sfas accordingly  we had not previously recognized compensation expense  except for share based compensation expense accounted for in accordance with apb sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods as share based compensation expense in the company s statement of operations 
for the year ended december   the statement of operations included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we changed our method of attributing the value of share based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted on or prior to december  will continue to be recognized using the accelerated multiple option approach while compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  is recognized using the straight line single option method 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the statement of operations in fiscal is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in our pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
as permitted by sfas r  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model as our method of valuation for share based awards granted 
the black scholes model was previously utilized for our pro forma information required under sfas our determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the our employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented deferred compensation as a separate component of stockholders equity 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  on january  we reclassified the balance in deferred compensation to additional paid in capital on our balance sheet 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
we make adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  for estimated excess  obsolete and potential scrapped inventories 
we estimate excess and obsolete inventories by identifying the amount of on hand and on order materials and comparing those to expected future sales for the next twelve months  taking into account clinical trial and development usage along with new product introductions 
we utilize a standard cost system to track inventories on a part by part basis that approximates first in  first out 
if necessary  adjustments are made to the standard materials  standard labor and standard overhead costs to approximate actual labor and actual overhead costs 
the labor and overhead elements of our standard costs are based on full utilization of our manufacturing capacity 
bonus accrual for the bonus pool  the compensation committee authorized an amount of up to of salary and wages for non sales employees to be awarded from the pool based on the weighted average achievement measured against certain objectives 
no company wide bonus was paid for and the  that had been accrued in prior quarters was reversed to the statement of operations in the fourth quarter of revenue recognition we sell products through a direct sales force in the united states 
we recognize revenue on product sales upon shipment 
we accrue for estimated returns at the time of shipment 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical study expenses  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations  physicians and participating hospitals 
these expenses can be a significant component of research and development expenses 
we accrue expenses for clinical studies performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
expenses for setting up clinical trial sites and study initiation are accrued immediately 
clinical expenses related to patient enrollment and ongoing monitoring are accrued as the trials progress 
warranty accrual we accrue for estimated warranty costs at the time of shipment 
we estimate warranty accruals by analyzing the timing  cost and amount of returned product 
we evaluate assumptions and historical warranty experience on at least a quarterly basis to determine the continued appropriateness of such assumptions 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for us beginning october  only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve these objectives  our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including money market funds  us treasury debt and corporate debt securities 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
to date we have recorded no product sales and have not entered into any agreements denominated in other than us dollars 
accordingly we believe we have no material exposure to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates
