item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we provide proprietary  value added products to a diverse customer base covering a broad spectrum of industries 
this strategic customer diversification means that demand for our products depends  in part  upon certain general economic conditions  which affect our markets in varying ways from year to year 
similar to and  during the company continued to benefit from a strong manufacturing economy and from significant military and defense spending 
as a result  the company experienced strong demand for its specialty products from various key markets including defense  wind energy  heavy equipment  medical equipment  aerospace  and petrochemical processing  which resulted in record annual sales of million 
benefiting from the record sales  the company generated net income of million  and cash flow from operations of million during cash and cash equivalents increased million during the year 
the total order book for equaled million  compared to million in  and million in our year end backlog of million provides a firm foundation for operating performance in the company continues to focus on programs intended to reduce costs  improve capacity utilization  increase efficiencies  and grow market share and cash flow  thereby positioning the company to capitalize on future opportunities in targeted end markets  especially during a period of sustained economic growth 
during  the company announced two major growth initiatives to increase its capacity to provide performance critical specialty bearing assemblies to serve the rapidly growing wind energy and medical and security equipment markets 
we believe that these initiatives will be important growth drivers for both north american and international sales in the years ahead 
in addition  the company continued a company wide six sigma effort and continued its investments in lean manufacturing and information systems to strengthen the company s operational excellence 
the company s effective tax rate of percent reflects reductions to the tax provision totaling million related to deductions recognized for financial reporting purposes  after examinations by certain taxing authorities  or after the expiration of applicable review periods 
absent any similar items  we currently expect the effective tax rate for to be approximately percent 
maintaining the company s strong balance sheet and financial flexibility remains a key strategy of the company 
the company s current cash balances  its million revolving credit facility  its million shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  and other available financial resources enhance liquidity and provide additional financial strength to support the company s objectives  including strategic acquisitions 
as disclosed in item of this annual report  the company has concluded that its system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of december  our independent registered public accounting firm s report on internal control over financial reporting is also included in item under the heading report of independent registered public accounting firm internal control 
in summary  in the future the company expects to benefit from a favorable manufacturing economy and resultant capital spending levels  continued strong military and defense spending  the growth of key markets such as the wind energy industry and medical equipment industries  and the utilization of current liquidity levels in completing both internal growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions 
however  because many of these factors are external to the company  it is difficult to predict the specific impact they may have on the company s future operating results 
the discussion which follows should be reviewed in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report to assist in understanding the company s results of operations  its financial condition  cash flows  capital structure and other relevant financial information

table of contents specifically  the friction and motion control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million or percent compared to sales of million 
the increase is principally the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to various defense related markets of million  the wind energy market of million  the heavy equipment market of million  the medical equipment market of million  the specialty electronics market of million  and the machinery market of million 
sales of split roller bearings  used globally in various industrial markets  increased million compared to last year 
our velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million  reflecting increased sales of gas springs  hydraulic dampers  and other products in germany and other euro bloc countries 
our sealing products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  an increase of million  or percent from sales of million  as demand increased from both the aerospace and petroleum processing markets 
our other businesses achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
sales growth in our other businesses was due primarily to growth in our air and liquid filtration businesses 
gross profit from continuing operations for equaled million or percent of sales as compared to million or percent of sales for compared to  gross margin for was favorably impacted by the full year effect of selling price and capacity increases implemented during the second half of  increased demand  and the company s ongoing focus on improving operating efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses of continuing operations totaled million or percent of sales in  compared to million or percent of sales for primarily as a result of the company s effort to reduce its exposure to changes in exchange rates applicable to non functional currency assets and liabilities  we recorded an exchange gain of million in  compared to an exchange loss of million in  resulting in a million decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses when comparing to in addition  in the company s selling  general  and administrative expenses were favorably impacted by million resulting from an insurance refund  and a reduction in the company s environmental reserves 
operating income from continuing operations equaled million during  compared to million in  with operating margins of percent and percent in and on a reporting segment basis  operating income from the friction and motion control products reporting segment was million during as compared to million during the increase is the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to the wind energy  defense  heavy equipment and medical equipment markets  and of split roller bearing products used globally in various industrial markets 
the growth of operating income was also positively affected by the full year benefit of actions taken in the second half of to increase certain selling prices and achieve improved operating efficiencies 
the velocity control products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during operating income growth was due primarily to higher sales in the sealing products reporting segment contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during the increased operating income was due primarily to higher sales in our other businesses contributed million to our consolidated operating income during as compared to million during each of our other businesses generated increased operating income in compared with  as a result of either higher sales or improved operating efficiencies 
during both and  million of interest and amortization of issuance costs related to our million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes was charged to interest expense 
we expect a similar amount to be charged to interest expense during as a result of higher investment interest rates and higher cash and cash equivalent balances  interest income increased to million during  compared with million during the effective tax rate for continuing operations for was percent compared to percent in the effective tax rates for both and reflect reductions to the tax provisions related to deductions recognized for financial reporting purposes  after examinations by certain taxing authorities  or after the expiration of applicable review periods  totaling million in and million in we expect the effective tax rate for to be approximately percent 
the final consensus of the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf  the effects of contingently convertible instruments on diluted earnings per share  states that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s contingent convertible senior subordinated notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether or not the market price trigger has been met 
the notes are

specifically  the friction and motion control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million or percent compared to sales of million 
the increase is the result of increased sales of custom engineered bearings to various defense related markets of million  the wind energy market of million  the heavy equipment market of million  and the medical equipment market of million 
also  sales of split roller bearings  used globally in various industrial markets  increased million compared to these increases were partially offset by reduced sales of custom engineered bearings to the specialty electronics manufacturing equipment market of million and to the machinery market of million  and by reduced sales to specialty ball markets of million 
our velocity control products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
the small product line acquisition completed in late contributed million to the sales increase 
our sealing products reporting segment achieved sales of million during  an increase of million  or percent from sales of million  as sales of new industrial seal products and industrial seal maintenance services increased million as a result of increased spending by refining and petrochemical plants for equipment upgrades and overhaul activities 
also  sales were affected by a work stoppage at the baltimore  maryland facility late in the year 
our other businesses achieved sales of million during  up million  or percent from sales of million 
sales of million by a january acquisition and million of additional sales of metal forming equipment were partially offset by reduced sales of certain liquid filtration products 
gross profit from continuing operations for equaled million or percent of sales as compared to million or percent of sales for compared to  gross margin for was negatively affected early in the year by a shift in product mix and increased material costs  particularly in our specialty bearings business 
higher material costs related to both higher prices for raw materials and to more production processes being outsourced during the start up phases of new product programs in the military and wind energy markets 
during the third quarter of certain selling price increases were initiated  substantially offsetting the higher raw material costs  and capital equipment additions completed in the second half of the year reduced the amount of outsourcing required 
these selling price and capacity increases had a positive affect on our fourth quarter gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses of continuing operations totaled million or percent of sales in  compared to million or percent of sales for generally  selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as a result of higher sales volume 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million due to additional amortization costs associated primarily with acquisitions

liquidity  working capital  and cash flows one of our financial strategies is to maintain a high level of liquidity and cash flow  which continued in historically  we have generated significant cash flows from operating activities to fund capital expenditures  dividends and other operating requirements 
cash flow generation has been enhanced by our continuing efforts to improve operating efficiencies  cost reductions and the management of working capital requirements 
one of our strengths is our ability to generate cash from operations in excess of requirements for capital investments and dividends 
net cash from operating activities equaled million in  million in  and million in net cash from operating activities in improved over due to higher net income  improved working capital management  and the absence of a million tax payment related to the gain on the sale of the power and data transmission products group 
net capital expenditures to reduce costs  improve quality and expand productive capacity equaled million in  million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures in compared to was driven by two major growth initiatives to increase the company s capacity to provide performance critical specialty bearing assemblies to serve the rapidly growing wind energy and medical and security equipment markets

during capital expenditures totaled million for these two growth initiatives 
during we expect to invest approximately million in net capital expenditures 
common stock dividends paid in  and equaled million in each year 
during  the company entered into an amended and restated agreement for its senior credit facility with its syndicate of lenders  replacing the company s previous million credit facility 
the credit agreement provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility

the revolving credit facility contains restrictive financial covenants on a consolidated basis including leverage and coverage ratios  utilizing measures of earnings and interest expense as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement 
under the leverage ratio restriction  the company may not allow the ratio of total indebtedness  net of domestic cash in excess of million  to adjusted earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization to exceed to under the interest coverage ratio restriction  the company may not allow the ratio of adjusted earnings before interest expense and taxes to interest expense to be less than to the company is in compliance with all restrictive covenants contained in the revolving credit facility at december  after consideration of the facility s covenants and million of letters of credit issued under the facility  the company has available credit under its revolving credit facility of million at december  fees related to the revolving credit facility of approximately million are being amortized as a component of interest expense over a five year period 
revolving credit facility fees included in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   equaled million 
during  we completed the sale of the power and data transmission products group for million cash  resulting in an after tax gain of million or per diluted share  which is being reported as a component of income from discontinued operations 
the company continues its corporate development efforts to complement internal growth through the acquisition of additional companies that meet kaydon s well disciplined criteria  and in january  acquired purafil  inc for million 
an independent appraiser was engaged to assist in determining the fair values of separately recognized intangible assets of purafil 
after allocating cost to other assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  the excess cost of the acquisition  equal to million  was recognized as goodwill

the notes may not be redeemed by us until may  but are redeemable at any time thereafter at par  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
holders of the notes will have the option to require us to purchase their notes at par for one day each at the end of   and years after issuance 
in addition  the holders have the right to require redemption of the notes before the specified maturity dates in the event of a change of control of the company  as identified in the notes indenture 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires us to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate on the notes 
the deductibility for tax purposes of the additional interest beyond the stated coupon rate may have to be recaptured  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed at par for cash instead of surrendered for conversion 
redemption of the notes at par for cash may cause volatility in tax payments  cash flows and the liquidity of the company

refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note for further information 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
we continually evaluate the estimates  judgments  and assumptions used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  our estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from the current estimates made by the company 
we have identified certain accounting policies and estimates  described below  that are the most critical to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions regarding future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known or anticipated engineering change orders  new products  and other factors 
we believe the accounting estimates related to inventories to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine the valuation of inventories  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
impairment of long lived assets we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived assets including fixed assets and amortizable intangible assets may warrant revision or that remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we use an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining lives of the long lived assets that are compared to the carrying value of the asset to evaluate whether the asset costs are recoverable 
we believe the accounting estimates related to long lived asset impairment to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of undiscounted future cash flows  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  and projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note in this annual report for additional information regarding long lived assets 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets the company annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a need  tests the carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we identify impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of each of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
the fair value of each of our reporting units is derived from an estimate of discounted future cash flows including estimates for terminal value 
in we used an percent discount rate  and a growth assumption of percent in perpetuity to calculate terminal value 
in a percent discount rate was utilized 
the discount rate used each year is the value weighted average of the company s estimated cost of equity and estimated cost of debt cost of capital derived using both known and estimated  customary  marketplace metrics 
the principal marketplace metrics used in the estimation of the discount rate  which changed from to  were an increase in the variability of market returns on kaydon equity and  to a lesser extent  an increase in long term interest rates 
our calculation methodology was unchanged during  and the consistent application of this methodology may result in changes in the discount rate in future periods 
potential goodwill impairment is identified if a reporting unit s carrying amount is more than a reporting unit s fair value 
if this occurs  normally a third party valuation specialist is utilized to assist the company in determining the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the amount of any actual impairment loss is calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
trademarks are the company s only indefinite lived intangible assets 
we identify impairment of these trademarks by comparing their fair value to their carrying amounts 
the fair values of the trademarks are calculated based on estimates of discounted future cash flows related to the net amount of royalty expenses avoided due to the existence of the trademarks 
we believe the accounting estimates related to impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets to be critical accounting estimates because the estimate of discounted future cash flows and terminal values  while based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  requires the company s subjective judgments  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often 
table of contents lengthy which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made  projected outcomes based on the assumptions made can vary  and the calculation of implied fair value is inherently subject to estimates 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
contingent convertible senior subordinated notes we have outstanding million of contingent convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes 
the notes are convertible into a total of  shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  provided certain contingencies are met 
the notes become convertible during any calendar quarter if the closing sale price of company common stock is more than for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter 
based on this formula  holders will be able to convert their notes during the first quarter of generally accepted accounting principles require that the impact of contingently convertible instruments that are convertible into common stock upon the achievement of a specified market price of the issuer s shares  such as the company s notes  should be included in diluted earnings per share computations regardless of whether or not the market price trigger has been met 
accordingly  net income used in the calculation of diluted earnings per share amounts is adjusted by adding back the after tax interest expense  including amortization of debt issuance costs  attributable to the notes and total shares outstanding are increased by the number of shares that would be issuable upon conversion 
in addition  the contingent interest feature of the notes requires the company to deduct for tax purposes an amount of interest expense that is greater than the stated coupon rate on the notes 
the deductibility for tax purposes of the additional interest beyond the stated coupon rate may have to be recaptured  in part or in whole  if the notes are redeemed at par for cash instead of surrendered for conversion 
should this happen  depending on other factors  tax payments may increase 
we believe that the impact the notes have on the accounting for our diluted earnings per share calculations  and tax related account balances as discussed above are critical to the understanding of our current financial condition and results of operations 
the existence of the notes has caused further dilution to our diluted earnings per share calculation  and redemption of the notes at par for cash may cause volatility in tax payments  cash flows and the liquidity of the company 
to better understand the notes and their impact on the company s financial reporting  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note and note and other discussions in this annual report 
retirement benefits our employee pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations recorded in the financial statements are dependent on the company s estimates provided to and used by our actuaries in calculating such amounts 
we believe the accounting estimates related to retirement benefits to be critical accounting estimates because of the wide range of assumptions used in deriving yearly contribution and expense amounts as well as the amounts recorded for retirement benefits in our financial statements 
significant assumptions include judgments regarding discount rates  health care cost trend rates  salary growth rates  and long term returns on plan assets 
we have developed estimates based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other judgments and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current facts and circumstances 
in developing the discount rate assumption used to determine the pension and postretirement benefit obligations at september  and  the company calculated the cash flows represented by the projected benefit obligations of three pension plans constituting greater than percent of the company s pension plans total projected benefit obligation 
these cash flows were discounted at corresponding interest rates derived from a hypothetical yield curve constructed using the top quartile of high rated aa or aa non callable bonds with at least million of par value outstanding 
the equivalent weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the interest rate that equates the total present value with the stream of future cash flows 
the discount rate applicable to the company s three largest pension plans was also used for several smaller pension plans and the company s postretirement benefit plans 
in  a similar  independent development of the discount rate assumption was used for the non qualified pension plan 
prior to using the yield curve approach  the discount rate assumptions used for the pension and postretirement net periodic benefit costs in and were based on investment yields available on long term corporate bonds 
health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical data  the near term outlook  and on an assessment of likely long term trends 
salary growth assumptions reflect our long term experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
long term return on plan assets is based on an evaluation of historical and expected returns of the individual asset classes comprising the total plan assets 
assumed discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  and rate of compensation increase have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the pension 
table of contents plans 
a percent increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have increased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent increase in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and a percent decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during a percent increase in the rate of compensation increase would have increased the net periodic benefit cost by million during  and would have increased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
a percent decrease in the rate of compensation increase would have decreased the net periodic benefit cost by million  and would have decreased the projected benefit obligation as of the measurement date by million 
the following table summarizes certain of the company s assumptions postretirement pension benefits benefits weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate qualified pension plans and postretirement benefit plans discount rate non qualified pension plan n a n a rate of compensation increase weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets n a n a rate of compensation increase actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension and postretirement benefits costs and obligations 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding costs  obligations  and assumptions for employee pension and postretirement benefits 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates for the effect of differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
these deferred tax assets and liabilities are reviewed for recoverability by using estimates of future taxable income streams and the impact of tax planning strategies 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
reserves are also estimated for ongoing audits regarding federal  state and international issues that are currently unresolved 
income tax is provided based upon an effective tax rate that is dependent upon tax regulations governing the regions in which we conduct business  geographic composition of worldwide earnings  the availability of tax credits and other factors 
in each of the last three years our effective tax rate has been affected by reductions to our tax provision related to deductions recognized for financial reporting purposes  after examinations by taxing authorities  or after the expiration of applicable review periods 
we believe the accounting estimates related to income taxes to be critical accounting estimates because the range of assumptions used to determine deferred tax assets and liabilities and to record current tax benefits and liabilities  while based on reasonable and supportable information  may change from year to year causing projected outcomes based on the assumptions to vary 
to better understand this accounting policy and its impact on the company  readers should refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements note in this annual report for additional information regarding income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which exist as part of our ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in cash and cash equivalents 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
we place our investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for would not have a material impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  mexico  and asia 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of countries in these regions affect our financial condition and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
we have mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of our currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which certain costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  we enter into derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition and cash flows
