general we provide staffing services primarily in suburban and rural markets secondary markets  as well as in the downtown areas of certain major urban centers primary markets in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
through our network of company owned  franchise agent and licensed offices  we offer a wide range of staffing solutions  including permanent placement  replacement  supplemental and on site temporary programs to businesses and government agencies 
our primary focus is on recruiting and placing clerical administrative and light industrial personnel 
we have over years of experience in the staffing industry and  as of october   operated through offices in states and three foreign countries 
as of october   of these offices were owned by us and were operated by franchise agents and one licensee 
we have four reportable segments domestic business services  united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
domestic business services provides a variety of staffing services  primarily in clerical and light industrial positions  through a network of company owned and franchise agent offices 
the segment consists of eight geographically diverse company regions under the direction of regional managers and one combined franchise region 
the international reportable segments comprise company owned offices  primarily providing clerical and light industrial staffing services 
we employ a managing director who oversees operations in the united kingdom and a managing director who oversees operations in australia and new zealand 
revenue is attributed to each country based on the location of the respective country s principal offices 
please see discussions in note to our consolidated financial statements attached to this annual report of form k for a discussion on financial information on our segments for the past three fiscal years 
we were founded in and incorporated in california in in october  we reincorporated in delaware 
our corporate name was changed to westaff  inc in september our executive offices are located at north wiget lane  walnut creek  california  and our telephone number is we transact business through our subsidiaries  the largest of which is westaff usa  inc  a california corporation  which is the primary operating entity 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we sold our operations in norway and denmark  and  during fiscal  we sold our medical business  primarily operated through western medical services  inc western medical  a wholly owned subsidiary of us 
as a result  we have classified these operations as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
services our service offerings are focused primarily on placing clerical administrative and light industrial personnel into both temporary and permanent positions 
clerical administrative services 
clerical administrative services personnel are placed for a broad range of general business positions including receptionists  administrative assistants  data entry operators  word processors  customer service representatives  telemarketers and various other general office  accounting  bookkeeping and clerical staff 
clerical administrative positions also include call center agents  such as customer service  help desk and technical support staff 
light industrial services 
light industrial services personnel are placed for a variety of assignments including general factory and manufacturing work including production  assembly and support workers  merchandise packers and machine operators  warehouse work such as general laborers  stock clerks  material handlers  order pickers  forklift operators and shipping receiving clerks  technical work such as lab technicians  inspectors  quality control technicians and drafters and general services such as maintenance and repair personnel  janitors and food service workers 
permanent placement services 
permanent placement services are typically contingent fee based services to recruit and fill regular staff positions for customers 
these services include locating  screening and assessing candidates on behalf of customers 
if the candidate is hired by the customer  we are generally paid a fee based on a percentage of the annual starting compensation for the candidate placed 
management believes that clerical administrative and light industrial staffing services are the foundation of the staffing industry and will remain a significant market for the foreseeable future 
management also believes that employees performing clerical administrative and light industrial staffing functions are  and will remain  an integral part of the labor market in local  regional and national economies in which we operate 
we also provide other services within the clerical administrative and light industrial staffing market such as temp to hire services  payrolling  on site and on location services  and other professional services including skills and behavioral assessments and coordination of drug testing and background checking 
temp to hire services represent the placement of temporary staff with a customer with the option to convert the temporary staff to a permanent customer employee at a later date 
payrolling typically involves the transfer of some of the customer s short term seasonal or special use employees to our payroll for a designated period 
on site programs provide administrative services for our customers such as coordinating all temporary staffing services throughout a customer s location  including skills assessment and training 
on location programs provide for an independent branch office located at the customer s facility 
they are typically intended for large non seasonal accounts with more than million in annual revenue 
this type of branch office is generally staffed by at least one manager level employee 
both on site and on location relationships provide customers with dedicated account management  which can more effectively meet the customer s changing staffing needs with high quality  consistent service 
these programs tend to have comparatively lower operating expenses and relatively longer customer relationships 
to complement our service offerings  we utilize a number of tools focused on increasing the pool of qualified candidates using advanced selection procedures for potential candidates talent trak as well as technology based management services that allow clients to maximize workforce productivity time trak 
we believe that these tools enhance our competitive edge and position us to more effectively pursue high growth market niches such as financial services  customer interaction centers and high end administrative placement 
talent trak 
to ensure high quality placements for customers and employees  we use talent trak to strengthen the quality of our selection process 
this comprehensive selection process includes flexible recruiting methods  interviewing and reference checking 
we conduct advanced skills and behavioral assessments using talent trak  and also provide the option for both background and drug testing that can be customized to meet a customer s specific needs 
we maintain contracts with national drug testing and background testing service providers to help ensure high quality and consistency in assessing our candidates 
time trak 
this tool provides customers with a web based management system to assist in maximizing workforce productivity 
time trak is a flexible system allowing customers access to information to track a variety of performance measurements such as workforce hours  labor costs  attendance and staff performance 
time trak also includes features to automate timecard and payroll processing 
markets we provide staffing services primarily in secondary markets  as well as in the downtown areas of certain primary markets in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and new zealand 
we capitalize on our presence in secondary markets to build market share by targeting small to medium sized customers  including divisions of fortune companies 
we believe that in many cases  such markets are less competitive and less costly to operate in than in the more central areas of primary markets  where a large number of staffing services companies frequently compete for business and occupancy costs are relatively high 
in addition  management believes that secondary markets are more likely to provide the opportunity to sell commercial and recurring business that is characterized by relatively higher gross margins 
we augment this concentration on secondary markets by also focusing on selected national contracts with customers having a large presence in these marketplaces 
such accounts include large clients in multiple locations supported by a dedicated corporate level business relationship manager 
we currently have existing national accounts across many different business sectors such as manufacturing  government  financial services  technology and communications 
we maintain a professional sales team that services and leverages existing relationships to retain and grow these accounts 
in addition  we continue to develop aggressive marketing programs to target and acquire additional clients that fit our branch system footprint 
management believes that our geographic alignment allows us to effectively compete for some of these national contracts 
we market our staffing services to local and regional customers through a network of company owned and franchise agent offices  as well as through our on site and on location service locations and through one licensed office 
domestically  our national marketing campaigns are coordinated through our corporate headquarters in cooperation with us field offices 
marketing efforts for regional and international markets are generally conducted at the local level 
new customers are developed by the field offices primarily through direct sales efforts and referrals 
we have a robust targeted marketing program and a consultative sales process that includes telemarketing  e mail marketing and direct mail campaigns 
recruiting we believe that a key component of our success is the ability to recruit and maintain a pool of qualified personnel and regularly place them into desirable and appropriate positions 
we use comprehensive methods to identify  assess  select and  when appropriate  measure the skills of our temporary employees and permanent placement candidates to meet the needs of our customers 
domestically  we believe one of our key competitive advantages in attracting and retaining staffing personnel is our payroll system  which provides us with the ability to print payroll checks at virtually all of our branch offices within hours after receipt of a timecard 
most company owned offices offer temporary employees a benefit package  including a service bonus and holiday pay 
franchise agent offices have the option to offer this benefit 
all eligible temporary employees have the option to participate in our k plan and discounted employee stock purchase plan 
operations we operate each company owned office as a separate profit center and provide managers considerable operational autonomy and financial incentives 
we also operate franchise agent offices in appropriate markets 
managers focus on business opportunities within markets and are provided centralized support to achieve success in those markets 
we believe that this structure allows us to recruit and retain highly motivated managers who have demonstrated the ability to succeed in a competitive environment 
this structure also allows managers and staff to focus on market development while relying on centralized services for support in back office operations  such as risk management programs and unemployment insurance  credit  collections  accounting  advice on legal and regulatory matters  quality standards and marketing 
as of october   we operated through a network of offices in states and three foreign countries 
in addition  from time to time we establish recruiting offices both for recruiting candidates and for testing demand for our services in new market areas 
our operations are decentralized with branch  market and district managers  regional vice presidents and franchise agents enjoying considerable autonomy in hiring  determining business mix and advertising 
the following table sets forth information as to the number of offices in operation as of the dates indicated nov

 number of offices by ownership company owned franchise agent licensed total number of offices by location domestic international total excludes company owned recruiting offices 
company owned offices 
employees of each company owned office typically report to a branch or market manager who is responsible for day to day operations and the profitability of a market that consists of one to several offices 
domestically  branch or market managers typically report to district managers or regional vice presidents 
district managers report to regional vice presidents who  in turn  report to the president and chief executive officer 
as of december   there were six regional vice presidents and eight district managers 
we have a variety of incentive plans in place for our domestic and international offices 
one or more of these plans may be offered to branch staff as well as market and district managers and regional vice presidents 
these plans are designed to motivate employees to maximize the growth and profitability of their office  district or region  as well as to achieve budgeted goals 
management believes that our incentive based compensation plans encourage employees in our company owned offices to increase sales and profits  resulting in a creative and committed team 
franchise agent offices 
our franchise agents have the exclusive right by contract to sell certain of our services and to use our service marks  business names and systems in a specified geographic territory 
our franchise agent agreements generally allow franchise agents to open multiple offices within their exclusive territories 
as of october   our franchise agents operated franchise agent offices 
sales generated by franchise agent operations and related costs are included in our consolidated revenue and costs of services  respectively  and during fiscal   and franchise agent sales represented   and respectively  of our revenue 
the franchise agent  as an independent contractor  is responsible for establishing and maintaining an office and paying related administrative and operating expenses  such as rent  utilities and salaries of its branch office staff 
each franchise agent functions as a limited agent of the company in recruiting job applicants  soliciting job orders  filling those orders and assisting and cooperating with collection matters upon request  but otherwise functions as an independent contractor 
as franchisor  we are the employer of the temporary employees and the owner of the customer accounts receivable and are responsible for paying the wages of the temporary employees and all related payroll taxes and insurance 
as a result  we provide a substantial portion of the working capital needed for the franchise agent operations 
franchise agents are required to follow our operating procedures and standards in recruiting  screening  classifying and retaining temporary personnel 
our sale of franchises is regulated by the federal trade commission and by state business opportunity and franchise laws 
we have filed registrations  been exempted from registration or filed a notice in all states that require pre sale registration or a notice filing under franchise investment laws in order to offer the sale of franchises 
we have not sought registration in one state in which no pre sale notice is required 
licensed offices 
as of october   one licensee operated one licensed office 
we are no longer offering the license program 
the licensee is the employer of the temporary employees and the owner of the customer accounts receivable 
we finance the licensee s temporary employee payroll  payroll taxes and insurance 
this indebtedness is secured by a pledge of the licensee s accounts receivable  tangible and intangible assets  and the license agreement 
borrowings under the lines of credit bear interest at a rate equal to the reference rate of bank of america  na plus two percentage points 
interest is charged on the borrowings only if the outstanding balance exceeds certain specified limits 
the licensee is required to operate within the framework of our policies and standards  but must obtain its own workers compensation  liability  fidelity bonding and state unemployment insurance coverage  which determines its payroll costs 
our franchise and license agreements have an initial term of five years and are renewable for multiple five year terms 
the agreements generally contain two year non competition covenants which we vigorously seek to enforce 
efforts to enforce the non competition covenants have resulted in litigation brought by us following termination of certain franchise agent and license agreements 
seasonality we have experienced significant fluctuations in our operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations will continue 
operating results may fluctuate due to a number of factors  including seasonality  the demand for our services  the level of competition within our markets  our ability to increase the productivity of our existing offices  control costs and expand operations and the availability of qualified personnel 
in addition  our results of operations could be  and have in the past been  adversely affected by severe weather conditions 
our fourth fiscal quarter generally consists of weeks  while our first  second and third fiscal quarters consist of weeks each 
moreover  our results of operations have also historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations 
demand for our services historically has been greatest during our fourth fiscal quarter due largely to the planning cycles of many of our customers 
furthermore  sales for the first fiscal quarter are typically lower due to national holidays as well as customer shutdowns during and after the holiday season 
these shutdowns and post holiday season declines in economic activity negatively impact job orders received by us  particularly in the light industrial sector 
customers we service small and medium sized companies as well as divisions of fortune companies and local  state and federal government agencies 
as is common in the staffing industry  our engagements to provide temporary services to our customers are generally of a non exclusive  short term nature and subject to termination by the customer with little or no notice 
during fiscal  no single customer accounted for more than of our revenue 
our ten highest volume customers in fiscal accounted for an aggregate of of our revenue 
competition the staffing industry is highly competitive with few barriers to entry 
we believe that the majority of commercial staffing companies are local  full service or specialized operations with less than five offices 
within local markets  typically no single company has a dominant share of the market 
we also compete for qualified candidates and customers with larger  national full service and specialized competitors in local  regional  national and international markets 
the principal national competitors are adecco sa  spherion corporation commercial staffing segment  kelly services  inc  manpower inc  remedy intelligent staffing  express personnel services  inc  and randstad north america 
many of our principal competitors have greater financial  marketing and other resources than us 
in addition  there are a number of medium sized firms which compete with us in certain markets where they may have a stronger presence  such as regional or specialized markets 
we believe that the competitive factors in obtaining and retaining customers include understanding customers specific job requirements  providing qualified temporary personnel and permanent placement candidates in a timely manner  monitoring quality of job performance and pricing of services 
we believe that the primary competitive factors in obtaining qualified candidates for temporary employment assignments are wages  benefits and flexibility and responsiveness of work schedules 
management information systems our domestic management information systems provide support to both branch office locations and the corporate back office 
branch offices utilize a proprietary application designed to assist in candidate searches  recruiting  customer order management  customer service  sales management and payroll entry and submission 
the application also provides for the sharing of information between branch offices and corporate headquarters 
utilizing this system  field offices capture and input customer  employee  billing and payroll information 
this information is electronically captured on centralized servers where payroll  billing and financial information is processed 
these systems allow us to print checks at our branch offices within hours or less after receipt of the timecard 
invoices are also processed daily and distributed from our centralized corporate office 
these systems also support branch office operations with daily  weekly  monthly and quarterly reports that provide information ranging from customer activity to office profitability 
each of our international operations have implemented customized or third party front office and or back office operating systems that are designed to meet the specific information technology and reporting requirements within the local jurisdiction 
during fiscal  we entered into a license agreement for a domestic business process management  or bpm  system which is being implemented in three phases 
the initial phase  which consisted of the human resources system for our regular employees  was successfully implemented in july the second phase  which includes the core financial systems and the accounts receivable module  went live in the beginning of fiscal year the final phase  which will include fully integrated front office functionality along with payroll and billing for temporary associates  is currently scheduled to go live in the fourth quarter of fiscal in addition  we made certain technology infrastructure upgrades in our australian operation during fiscal and are in the process of implementing a new front office system in our united kingdom operation 
risk management programs domestically  we are responsible for all employee related expenses for the temporary staff employees of our company owned and franchise agent offices including workers compensation  unemployment insurance  social security taxes  state and local taxes and other general payroll expenses 
we provide workers compensation insurance covering our domestic regular and temporary employees through a long term relationship with travelers property casualty company of america travelers 
for fiscal years and  we retained a  deductible per occurrence for these policies 
this retention was  per claim for fiscal we also purchase workers compensation insurance coverage based upon actual payroll classifications in the monopolistic state of north dakota  and we are self insured in the states of ohio and washington 
we are contractually required to collateralize our recorded obligations under the workers compensation insurance contracts with travelers through irrevocable letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
as of october   these aggregate collateral requirements have been satisfied through million of letters of credit 
our nationwide risk management program is managed by our risk management department consisting of risk management and workers compensation professionals as well as claim administrators who monitor the disposition of all claims and oversee  through an on line system  all workers compensation claim activity 
the department utilizes a variety of creative and aggressive workers compensation loss prevention and claim management strategies 
the risk management program includes safety programs  claim strategy reviews with the carrier and third party administrator  a return to work modified duty program  pre placement customer safety evaluations and light industrial job approvals  the use of personal protective equipment  and the use of individual local office expense allocation formulas 
employees as of october   we had approximately  temporary employees on assignment and employed regular staff 
our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements 
management believes that its relationships with its employees are good 
service marks we have various service marks registered with the united states patent and trademark office  with the state of california and in various foreign countries  including our primary westaff service mark 
we also own other service marks  including the westaff logo  talent trak  time trak  ms 
carmen courtesy  and staff for business jobs for people 
we have filed applications to register the service marks learning traksm and west teksm 
federal and state service mark registrations may be renewed indefinitely as long as the underlying mark remains in use

risk factors 
factors affecting future operating results this form k contains forward looking statements concerning our future programs  products  expenses  revenue  liquidity and cash needs as well as our plans and strategies 
these forward looking statements are based on current expectations and we assume no obligation to update this information  except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
numerous factors could cause actual results to differ significantly from the results described in these forward looking statements  including the following risk factors 
investing in our securities involves risk 
the following risk factors  issues and uncertainties should be considered when evaluating our future prospects 
in particular  please consider these risk factors when reading forward looking statements which appear throughout this report 
forward looking statements relate to our expectations for future events and time periods 
generally  words such as expect  intend  anticipate and similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
each of these forward looking statements involves risks and uncertainties  and future events and circumstances could differ significantly from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
any one of the following risks could harm our operating results or financial condition and could result in a significant decline in value of an investment in us 
further  additional risks and uncertainties that have not yet been identified or which we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our operating results and financial condition 
price competition in the staffing industry continues to be intense  and pricing pressures from both competitors and customers could adversely impact our financial results 
the staffing industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry and continues to undergo consolidation 
we compete in regional and local markets with large full service agencies  specialized temporary and permanent placement services agencies and small local companies 
while some competitors are smaller than us  they may enjoy an advantage in discrete geographic markets because of a stronger local presence 
other competitors have greater marketing  financial and other resources than us that  among other things  could enable them to attempt to maintain or increase their market share by reducing prices 
furthermore  in past years there has been an increase in the number of customers consolidating their staffing services purchases with a single provider or with a small number of providers 
the trend to consolidate staffing services purchases has in some cases made it more difficult for us to obtain or retain business 
we expect the level of competition to remain high in the future  and competitive pricing pressures will continue to make it difficult for us to raise our prices to immediately and fully offset increased costs of doing business  including increased labor costs  costs for workers compensation and  domestically  state unemployment insurance 
if we are not able to effectively compete in our targeted markets  our operating margins and other financial results will be harmed and the price of our securities could decline 
the amount of collateral that we are required to maintain to support our workers compensation obligations could increase  reducing the amount of capital that we have available to support and grow our field operations 
we are contractually obligated to collateralize our workers compensation obligations under our workers compensation program through irrevocable letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
as of october   our aggregate collateral requirements under these contracts have been secured through million of letters of credit  however  under certain circumstances  such as an inability to maintain minimum borrowing availability  we could be required to increase our letters of credit by million 
further  our workers compensation program expires november   and as part of the renewal  could be subject to an increase in collateral 
these collateral requirements are significant and place pressure on our liquidity and working capital capacity 
we believe that our current sources of liquidity are adequate to satisfy our immediate needs for these obligations  however  our available sources of capital are limited 
depending on future changes in collateral requirements  we could be required to seek additional sources of capital in the future  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms 
our reserves for workers compensation claims may be inadequate to cover our ultimate liability  and we may incur additional charges if the actual amounts exceed the reserved amounts 
we maintain reserves to cover our estimated liabilities for workers compensation claims based upon actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses which have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
the determination of these reserves is based on a number of factors  including current and historical claims activity  medical cost trends and developments in existing claims 
reserves do not represent an exact calculation of liability and are affected by both internal and external events  such as adverse development on existing claims  changes in medical costs  claims handling procedures  administrative costs  inflation  legal trends and legislative changes 
reserves are adjusted as necessary to reflect new claims and existing claims development  and such adjustments are reflected in the results of the periods in which the reserves are adjusted 
while we believe our judgments and estimates are adequate  if our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses  an adjustment could be charged to expense that may be material to our earnings 
workers compensation costs for temporary employees may continue to rise and reduce margins and require more liquidity 
in the united states  we are responsible for and pay workers compensation costs for our regular and temporary employees 
in recent years  these costs have risen substantially as a result of increased claims  general economic conditions  increases in healthcare costs and governmental regulations 
in fiscal  the increase in the volume of claims has fallen despite an increase in our domestic revenue  yet the increases in cost per claim have continued 
under our workers compensation insurance program  we maintain per occurrence insurance  which only covers claims for a particular event above a  deductible 
our workers compensation insurance policy expires november  and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully renew such policy 
further  there are covenants associated with the continuation of the policy and there can be no guarantee that we will continue to meet those covenants going forward 
should our workers compensation premium costs continue to increase in the future  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers to keep pace with increased costs or if we were unable to obtain insurance on reasonable terms or forced to significantly increase our deductible per claim  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity could be adversely affected 
we have significant working capital requirements and are heavily dependent upon our ability to borrow money to meet these working capital requirements 
we require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business and to pay expenses relating to employment of temporary employees 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
as a result  we must maintain sufficient cash availability to pay temporary personnel prior to receiving payment from customers 
we finance our operations primarily through borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and also through cash generated by our operating activities 
as of october   our total borrowing capacity was million consisting of million for the domestic operations  million for the united kingdom operations and million for the australian operations 
the amount we are entitled to borrow under our revolving credit facilities is calculated daily and is dependent on eligible trade accounts receivable generated from operations  which are affected by financial  business  economic and other factors  as well as by the daily timing of cash collections and cash outflows 
if we experience a significant and sustained drop in operating profits  or if there are unanticipated reductions in cash inflows or increases in cash outlays  we may be subject to cash shortfalls 
if such a shortfall were to occur for even a brief period of time  it may have a significant adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  our receivables may not be adequate to allow for borrowings for other corporate purposes  such as capital expenditures or growth opportunities  and we would be less able to react to changes in the market or industry conditions 
the credit facilities contain covenants which  among other things  require us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
at the end of fiscal  the minimum ebitda covenant increased to million on a trailing thirteen period basis 
we failed to comply with that covenant and were required to obtain a waiver from our lenders  which we did in conjunction with our tenth amendment executed january  any future failure to comply with the covenants under our credit facilities could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could trigger prepayment obligations 
if we were forced to refinance borrowings under the current facilities  there can be no assurance that such financing would be available or that such financing would not have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
even if such refinancing were available  the terms could be less favorable and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates 
we typically experience significant seasonal and other fluctuations in our borrowings and borrowing availability  particularly in the united states  and have  in the past  been required to aggressively manage our cash to ensure adequate funds to meet working capital requirements 
such steps included working to improve collections and adjusting the timing of cash expenditures  reducing operating expenses where feasible and working to generate cash from a variety of other sources 
we have historically experienced periods of negative cash flow from operations and investment activities  especially during seasonal peaks in revenue experienced in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the year 
in addition  we are required to pledge amounts to secure letters of credit that collateralize certain workers compensation obligations  and these amounts may increase in future periods 
any such increase in pledged amounts or sustained negative cash flows would decrease amounts available for working capital purposes and could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition 
any significant economic downturn could result in our customers using fewer staffing services  which could materially adversely affect our business 
demand for staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity 
as economic activity slows  many customers reduce their utilization of temporary employees before undertaking layoffs of their regular full time employees 
further  demand for permanent placement services also slows as the labor pool directly available to our customers increases  making it easier for them to identify new employees directly 
typically  we may experience increased pricing pressures from other staffing companies during periods of economic downturn  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the domestic economic recession of and did have a material adverse effect on our business 
additionally  in geographic areas where we derive a significant amount of business  a regional or localized economic downturn could adversely affect our operating results and financial position 
we assume the obligation to make wage  tax  and regulatory payments to our temporary employees and are then exposed to accounts receivable risks from our customers 
we generally assume responsibility for and manage the risks associated with our payroll obligations  including liability for payment of salaries and wages  payroll taxes as well as group health insurance 
these obligations are fixed and become a liability of ours  whether or not the associated client where these employees have been assigned makes payments required by our service agreement  which exposes us to credit risks 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by billing on a frequent basis  which typically occurs daily or weekly 
in addition  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required and timely payments 
further  we carefully monitor the timeliness of our customers payments and impose strict credit standards 
finally  the majority of our accounts receivable is used to secure our revolving credit facilities  which we rely on for liquidity 
if we fail to adequately manage our credit risks associated with accounts receivable  our financial position could be adversely impacted 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from franchise agent operations 
franchise agent operations comprise a significant portion of our revenue 
for fiscal  of our total revenue was derived from franchise agent operations 
in addition  our ten largest franchise agents for fiscal based on sales volume accounted for of our revenue 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to attract new franchisees or that we will be able to retain our existing franchisees 
the loss of one or more of our franchise agents and any associated loss of customers and sales could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are subject to business risks associated with international operations and fluctuating exchange rates 
we presently have operations in the united kingdom  australia and new zealand  which comprised of our revenue during fiscal operations in foreign markets are inherently subject to certain risks  including in particular different cultures and business practices  overlapping or differing tax structures  economic and political uncertainties  compliance issues associated with accounting and reporting requirements  and changing  complex or ambiguous foreign laws and regulations  particularly as they relate to employment 
all of our sales outside of the united states are denominated in local currencies and  accordingly  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in exchange rates  which could cause a reduction in our profits 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
the loss of any of our key personnel could harm our business 
our future financial performance is significantly impacted by our ability to attract  motivate and retain key management personnel including our chief executive officer and other members of the senior management team 
competition for qualified management personnel is very competitive and in the event that we experience turnover in senior management positions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to recruit suitable replacements on a timely basis 
we must also successfully integrate all new management and other key positions within our organization to achieve our operating objectives 
even if we are successful  turnover in key management positions could temporarily harm our financial performance and results of operations until the new management becomes familiar with our business 
our success is impacted by our ability to attract and retain qualified temporary and permanent candidates 
we compete with other staffing services to meet our customers needs  and we must continuously attract reliable candidates to meet the staffing requirements of our customers 
consequently  we must continuously evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel to keep pace with changing customer needs and emerging technologies 
furthermore  a substantial number of our temporary employees during any given year will terminate their employment with us and accept regular staff employment with our customers 
competition for individuals with proven skills remains intense  and demand for these individuals is expected to remain strong for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance that qualified candidates will continue to be available to us in sufficient numbers and on acceptable terms to us 
the failure to identify  recruit  train and place candidates as well as retain qualified temporary employees over a long period of time could materially adversely affect our business 
our service agreements may be terminated on short notice  leaving us vulnerable to loss of a significant amount of customers in a short period of time 
our service agreements are generally cancellable with little or no notice by the customer to us 
as a result  our customers can terminate their agreement with us at any time  making us particularly vulnerable to a significant decrease in revenue within a short period of time that could be difficult to quickly replace 
the cost of unemployment insurance for temporary employees may rise and reduce our margins 
in the united states  we are responsible for and pay unemployment insurance premiums for our temporary and regular employees 
at times  these costs have risen as a result of increased claims  general economic conditions and government regulations 
should these costs continue to increase  there can be no assurance that we will be able to increase the fees charged to our customers in the future to keep pace with the increased costs  and if we do not  our results of operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 
our information technology systems are critical to the operations of our business 
our information management systems are essential for data exchange and operational communications with branches spread across large geographical distances 
we have replaced key component hardware and software including backup systems within the past twelve months and are currently working towards replacing further key components over the next twelve to eighteen months 
any interruption  impairment or loss of data integrity or malfunction of these systems could severely impact our business  especially our ability to timely and accurately pay employees and bill customers 
further  any significant delay in our plans to replace the remaining key components could adversely affect the business 
issues with either would require that we commit significant additional capital as well as management resources in order to resolve the interruption or delay 
we may be exposed to employment related claims and costs that could materially adversely affect our business 
we are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplace of other businesses on either a temporary or permanent basis 
as a result  we are subject to a large number of laws and regulations relating to employment 
the risks related to engaging in such business include but are not limited to claims of discrimination and harassment  violations of wage and hour laws  criminal activity  claims relating to actions by customers including property damage and personal injury  misuse of proprietary information and misappropriation of assets  and immigration related claims 
in addition  some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation  which could be time consuming to our management team  and therefore  could have a negative effect on our business 
in some instances  we have agreed to indemnify our customers against some or all of these types of liabilities 
we have policies and guidelines in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks and have purchased insurance policies against certain risks in amounts that we currently believe to be adequate 
however  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover these types of liabilities or that we will be able to secure insurance coverage for such risks on affordable terms 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will not experience these issues in the future or that they could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our founder and chairman controls a significant amount of our outstanding stock thus allowing him to exert significant influence on our management and affairs 
our chairman and founder  w 
robert stover  beneficially owns directly or indirectly  or has voting power over  in excess of of our outstanding stock 
as the principal stockholder of westaff  mr 
stover has the ability to materially influence all matters submitted to the stockholders for approval and to exert significant influence on our management and affairs 
for example  mr 
stover has the ability to sell his shares independently and to strongly influence the election of the board of directors and the appointment of executive management 
he also has the ability to strongly influence any merger  consolidation  sale of substantially all of our assets or other strategic decisions affecting us or the market value of the stock 
this concentration of stock and voting power could be used by mr 
stover to delay or prevent an acquisition of westaff or other strategic action or result in strategic decisions that could negatively impact the value and liquidity of our outstanding stock 
the market for our stock may be limited  and the stock price may continue to be extremely volatile 
the average daily trading volume for our common stock on the nasdaq global market was approximately  shares from january   through december  accordingly  the market price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations that have been  and may continue to be  exaggerated because an active trading market has not developed for the stock 
we believe that the common stock price has also been negatively affected by the fact that our stock is thinly traded and also due to the absence of analyst coverage 
the lack of analyst reports about our stock may make it difficult for potential investors to make decisions about whether to purchase our stock and may make it less likely that investors will purchase the stock  thus further depressing the stock price 
these negative factors may make it difficult for stockholders to sell our common stock  which may result in losses for investors 
the compliance costs associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act regarding internal control over financial reporting could be substantial  while failure to achieve and maintain compliance could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and current securities and exchange commission sec regulations and proposed rules  beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ended november   we expect to be required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
further  we expect that our external auditors will be required to audit our internal control over financial reporting report and include their attestation on that report in our annual report on form k starting from our annual report for the fiscal year 
the process of fully documenting and testing our internal control procedures in order to satisfy these requirements will result in increased general and administrative expenses and may shift management time and attention from profit generating activities to compliance activities 
furthermore  during the course of our internal control testing  we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the reporting deadline under section failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment or complete our section certifications could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
we are involved in an action taken by the california employment development department 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were notified by the california employment development department  or edd  that our domestic operating subsidiaries unemployment tax rates would be increased retroactively for both calendar years and  which would result in additional unemployment taxes of approximately million 
we have timely appealed the ruling by the edd and are working with our outside counsel to resolve this matter 
although we believe that we have properly calculated our unemployment insurance tax and are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  there can be no assurances this will be settled in our favor 
we are a defendant in a variety of litigation and other actions from time to time  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are regularly involved in a variety of litigation arising out of our business and  in recent years  have paid significant amounts as a result of adverse arbitration awards 
we do not have insurance for some of these claims  and there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage we have will cover all claims that may be asserted against us 
should the ultimate judgments or settlements not be covered by insurance or exceed our insurance coverage  they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
there can also be no assurance that we will be able to obtain appropriate and sufficient types or levels of insurance in the future or that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to the results of operations and financial condition of westaff  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended october  cautionary statement this notice is intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by the private securities litigation reform act of with respect to forward looking statements 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed should be considered forward looking statements and readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on those statements 
the forward looking statements in this discussion are made based on information available as of the date hereof and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause the company s actual results and financial position to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements and to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a 
risk factors under the heading factors affecting future operating results 
the company undertakes no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events  except as required by applicable laws and regulations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported within those financial statements 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  workers compensation costs  collectibility of accounts receivable  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  contingencies  litigation and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experiences and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results under circumstances and conditions different than those assumed could result in differences from the estimated amounts in the financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
there have been no material changes to these policies during fiscal revenue recognition 
we record revenue from the sale of temporary staffing  permanent placement fees  and temp to hire fees by our company owned and franchised operations 
temporary staffing revenue and the related labor costs and payroll taxes are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
temp to hire fees are generally recorded when the temporary employee is hired directly by the customer 
permanent placement fees are recorded when the candidate commences full time employment and  if necessary  sales allowances are established to estimate losses due to placed candidates not remaining employed for the permanent placement guarantee period  which is typically four weeks 
we account for our revenue and the related direct costs of our franchise arrangements in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  recording revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we first assess whether we act as a principal in our transactions or as an agent acting on the behalf of others 
when we are the principal in a transaction and have the risks and rewards of ownership  we record the transaction gross in our income statement 
where we act merely as an agent  only the net fees earned are recorded in the income statement 
under our traditional franchise agreement  we have the direct contractual arrangements with our customers and the contracts are binding on us 
we are also the employer of all temporary employees in the franchise agents operations and  as such  are obligated for the temporary employee payroll  related payroll taxes and the risk of loss for accounts receivable collection 
as we retain the risks and rewards of ownership  the revenue and costs of services of our franchise agents are included in our results of operations 
each accounting period  we remit to each franchisee either a portion of the gross profit or a portion of the sales generated by its office s  based on what the relevant franchise agreement dictates 
franchise agents sales represented  and of the company s total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to the franchise agents for their services in marketing to customers  recruiting temporary employees and servicing customer accounts 
we also have a licensing program in which the lone licensee has the direct contractual relationships with the customers  holds title to the related customer receivables and is the legal employer of the temporary employees 
accordingly  revenue and costs of services generated by the license operation are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
we advance funds to our licensee for payroll  payroll taxes  insurance and other related items 
fees are paid to us based either on a percentage of revenue or of gross profit generated by the licensee and such license fees are recorded by us as license fees and included in revenue 
we are no longer offering license agreements to new prospects 
workers compensation reserves 
we self insure the deductible amount related to domestic workers compensation claims  which was  per claim for policy years and  and  per claim for policy year we maintain reserves for workers compensation costs based upon actuarial methods utilized to estimate the remaining undiscounted liability for the deductible portion of all claims  including those incurred but not reported 
this process includes establishing loss development factors based on our historical claims experience and the staffing industry  and applying those factors to current claims information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claims liability 
the calculated ultimate liability is computed for each policy year and is then reduced by the cumulative claims payments to determine the required reserves 
we evaluate the reserve and the underlying assumptions regularly throughout the year and make adjustments accordingly 
at least annually  we obtain an independent actuarially determined calculation of the estimated costs of claims actually made to date  as well as claims incurred but not yet reported 
if the actual costs of such claims and related expenses exceed the amounts estimated  additional reserves may be required 
these reserves amounted to million and million at october   and october   respectively 
while we believe that the recorded reserves are adequate  there can be no assurances that future  unfavorable changes to estimates relied upon in the determination of these reserves will not occur 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on an estimation of losses which could occur if customers are unable to make required payments 
we evaluate this allowance on a regular basis throughout the year and make adjustments as the evaluation warrants 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these allowances were million at october   and million at october  our estimates are influenced by numerous factors including our large  diverse customer base  which is disbursed across a wide geographical area 
no single customer accounted for more than of accounts receivable for fiscal year goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized but instead be subject to an impairment test performed on an annual basis or whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
intangible assets with finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we utilize an independent third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of our individual reporting units 
the valuation methodologies considered include analyses of discounted cash flows at the reporting unit level  publicly traded companies multiples within the temporary staffing industry and historical control premiums paid by acquirers purchasing companies similar to ours 
we perform our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes by utilizing an asset and liability approach that requires recording deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future year consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
as required under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we measure these expected future tax consequences based upon provisions of tax law as currently enacted 
the effects of future changes in tax laws are not anticipated 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
we also provide a reserve for tax contingencies when we believe a probable and estimatable exposure exists 
at october   substantially all of our net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
as a result of our positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  our long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in our financial position  we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed our full domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million 
reserves for legal and regulatory liabilities 
there are various claims  lawsuits and pending actions against us incident to our operations for which we have recorded liabilities that we believe are appropriate 
we evaluate this reserve regularly throughout the year and make adjustments as needed 
if the actual outcome of these matters is different than expected  an adjustment is charged or credited to expense in the period the outcome occurs or the period in which the estimate changes 
whereas management believes the recorded liabilities are adequate  there are inherent limitations in the estimation process whereby future actual losses may exceed projected losses  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
executive overview fiscal marks our highest revenue since fiscal and the highest gross profit since fiscal we are also very pleased to report a third consecutive profitable year following three challenging years in fiscal through our gross profit grew steadily quarter over quarter during the year to conclude at a increase over fiscal and a increase over fiscal gross margins mirrored these results  increasing from in fiscal to in fiscal and to in fiscal our continued success with permanent placement revenue  which increased as compared to fiscal  along with a focus on higher margin business are the predominant reasons underlying these increases 
at this point  we believe margins will continue to grow into fiscal  although there can be no assurance this will occur 
we closed fiscal with an improved financial position  including working capital of million and borrowing capacity of million 
these  coupled with strong cash flow from our operating activities  should be more than sufficient to meet expected working capital requirements for fiscal we believe that we are well positioned  both strategically and financially  to continue generating improved operating results in fiscal discontinued operations effective june   we sold our norway and denmark operations to personalhuset as  a recruitment and staffing company headquartered in norway 
net proceeds from the sale were approximately million 
of the total proceeds  approximately million is being held in an interest bearing escrow account as security for potential westaff norway pension claims 
the escrowed funds  net of any claim payments  will be remitted to us in june we recorded a net gain on the sale of million 
we have classified the operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and notes thereto 
as required under the terms of our multicurrency credit agreement  the net proceeds from the sale of the norway and denmark operations were used to pay down borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
interest expense has been allocated to these discontinued operations in accordance with eitf during fiscal  we discontinued our medical business western medical principally through a sale to intrepid usa under the terms of the sale  we retained the majority of accounts receivable  including trade and medicare accounts receivable balances 
during the third quarter of  we resolved certain significant legal and liability claims and evaluated future risks associated with remaining pending claims and  as a result  recorded million of income from the medical discontinued operations 
as of october   there are remaining current liabilities of the discontinued medical operations of  primarily for settled but unpaid claims 
results of continuing operations the table below sets forth  for the three most recent fiscal years  certain results of continuing operations data as a percentage of revenue 
fiscal year revenue costs of services gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization arbitration expenses operating income from continuing operations interest expense interest income income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax provision benefit income from continuing operations less than fiscal compared to fiscal revenue revenue increased million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal domestic revenue increased million or  largely due to an increase in average bill rates of  coupled with an increase in permanent placement revenue of 
these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in billed hours of  which reflects the effects of a shift in business mix in an effort to increase gross margin 
the increase in average bill rates primarily stems from a bill rate increase implemented in may  coupled with a generally more positive economic environment in fiscal compared to fiscal  which allowed us to price new business at higher rates as compared to fiscal further  the increase in our domestic permanent placement revenue is the result of both our focused training efforts and having a full compliment of permanent placement consultants in place for fiscal the hiring of these consultants commenced in the latter half of fiscal  and we intend to maintain or increase the number of these consultants during fiscal as a percentage of revenue  domestic permanent placement fees increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal based on our continuing efforts in this service line  coupled with a relatively low domestic unemployment rate  we are optimistic we can increase this revenue during fiscal offsetting the domestic revenue growth was a decrease in international revenue of million or 
the largest cause of this decrease was a million decrease in revenue from our australian subsidiary  primarily due to decreased revenue from several large  national accounts 
billed hours decreased in australia  and the average bill rate remained essentially the same in fiscal as it had been in fiscal partially offsetting this decrease in temporary services revenue  australia s permanent placement revenue increased or million 
in addition to the decrease noted in australia  revenue from our united kingdom operations decreased million  or 
this is primarily the result of a decrease in billable hours and average bill rates remaining essentially the same in fiscal as compared to fiscal the united kingdom operations were without a managing director for much of fiscal and  consequently  the operation did not have as robust a focus on sales as it should have  resulting in an overall decrease in revenue 
finally  revenue from our new zealand operations decreased million  or 
billable hours for temporary services decreased while the average bill rate decreased  primarily due to the loss of one national account  the volume of which was not replaced during the fiscal year 
costs of services and gross profit costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
on a consolidated basis  costs of services decreased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to an overall decrease in billable hours of  partially offset by an overall increase in average pay rates of 
this overall decrease in costs of services  coupled with the increase in revenue noted above  caused gross profit to increase million  or  and also caused gross margin to increase to as compared to for fiscal gross margin increased primarily as a result of bill rate increases and increases in permanent placement revenue  both explained above  coupled with stabilization of workers compensation costs and state unemployment insurance costs as explained below 
our domestic workers compensation costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative and light industrial 
unexpected adverse development of open claims and increases in our incurred but not reported ibnr claims can also significantly affect workers compensation costs 
we monitor claim activity and evaluate actuarial estimates to ensure that accruals and resulting costs remain appropriate in light of loss trends 
further  we aggressively work to close out claims on terms that are favorable to us and continually monitor costs and accrual rates in light of actual loss trends 
however  there can be no assurance that our efforts to control workers compensation costs will be effective or that loss development trends will not require additional increases in workers compensation accruals in future periods 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic workers compensation costs remained stable at for both fiscal and as a percent of domestic direct labor costs  state unemployment rates remained stable at for both fiscal and fiscal this stabilization assisted our efforts to manage consolidated costs of services in fiscal we continue to focus our efforts on improving gross margin through development of our permanent placement service line and movement of our business mix to those opportunities offering higher margins 
these efforts  coupled with both low domestic unemployment rates and strong national economies in the united kingdom  australia and new zealand  should allow us to continue improving gross margins into fiscal however  there can be no assurance we will be successful in that regard 
franchise agents share of gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of the sales or gross profit generated by the franchise agents operations 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit decreased from of revenue for fiscal to for fiscal  primarily due to the conversion of two franchised operations into company owned operations 
during the second fiscal quarter of  we acquired our houston  texas  franchised operations and at the beginning of our third fiscal quarter  we acquired our raleigh  north carolina  franchised operation 
therefore  upon acquisition  we maintained revenue streams from these operations yet were no longer paying out a portion of the gross profits 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is due to a combination of cost increases  including increased domestic salaries relating to revenue producing staff placed into our field offices in the amount of million  an enhanced field incentive plan to stimulate domestic sales growth in the amount of million  increased employee health related benefits of million  an increase in bank service charges of million and increased remote server hosting costs to support our business process management  or bpm  system of million 
in addition  throughout fiscal a number of management personnel were replaced and some positions eliminated both domestically and internationally  which led to severance costs for the departed employees in the amount of million 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million or  primarily due to higher depreciation associated with portions of our domestic bpm system that have been placed into service 
currently  we anticipate depreciation expense to increase in fiscal as a result of additional modules of the bpm system being placed in service  which will activate depreciation and amortization on these modules 
interest expense interest expense decreased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower average borrowings outstanding during the year partially offset by higher average interest rates 
contingent on maintaining or reducing our outstanding debt  coupled with no significant increase in interest rates  our interest expense would be expected to decline in fiscal income tax provision we record income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  management assessed the realizability of its deferred tax assets 
as a result of our positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  our long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in our financial position  management determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed our full  domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  which resulted in an increase in net income for fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
no similar reversal was expected or recorded during fiscal the income tax provision recorded during fiscal differs from statutory rates primarily due to federal tax credits we take advantage of  primarily as a result of the workers opportunity tax credit program 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenue revenue increased million or for fiscal as compared to fiscal domestic revenue increased million or  while international revenue increased over fiscal the domestic revenue increase is the result of a decrease in billed hours of  which was offset by an increase in average bill rates of 
the decline in domestic billed hours reflects the effects of the november divestiture of one of our franchises  the august divestiture of another of our franchises and a shift in business mix in an effort to increase gross margin 
the increase in average bill rates reflects the generally more positive economic environment with lower national unemployment rates  which allows us to pass along bill rate increases to customers in certain circumstances 
permanent placement fees increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is virtually all attributable to our domestic operations  which grew from million in fees in fiscal to million in fiscal  an increase of 
as a percentage of revenue  permanent placement fees in the us were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal of the increase in international revenue noted above  is attributable to higher currency exchange rates 
international billed hours increased and average bill rates increased 
local currency revenue from australia increased as a result of strong national account sales growth 
local currency revenue in the uk declined during fiscal  primarily due to off shoring of certain staffing functions by a number of westaff s uk customers 
costs of services costs of services include hourly wages of temporary employees  employer payroll taxes  state unemployment and workers compensation insurance and other employee related costs 
costs of services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal fiscal gross profit increased million  or  and gross margin increased to as compared to for fiscal gross margin increased primarily as a result of stabilization of workers compensation costs as noted below  bill rate increases  changes in business mix and increased permanent placement fees as noted above  partially offset by higher state unemployment insurance costs 
our domestic workers compensation costs tend to vary depending upon the mix of business between clerical administrative and light industrial staffing 
unexpected adverse development of open claims and increases in our ibnr claims can also significantly affect the level of accruals needed to cover workers compensation costs 
we review interim and annual actuarial estimates and monitor claim activity to ensure that accruals remain appropriate in light of loss trends 
however  unanticipated adverse loss development trends can result in a need for additional charges to be recorded 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic workers compensation costs decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the fiscal fourth quarter included a charge of million to increase our domestic workers compensation reserves as a result of unfavorable loss development trends 
during fiscal  we increased our basic accrual rates for workers compensation which  combined with more stable loss trends  resulted in no such charge in fiscal we aggressively work to close out claims on terms that are favorable to us and continually monitor our costs and accrual rates in light of actual loss trends 
as a percent of direct labor  domestic state unemployment rates increased from in fiscal to in fiscal this increase is largely due to an increase in the unemployment tax rate assessed in the state of california 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we were notified by the edd that our california unemployment tax rates would be increased retroactively for both calendar years and this rate increase was based on the edd finding that our wholly owned domestic operating subsidiaries would be considered as a single reporting entity for california unemployment tax reporting purposes 
management believes that it has properly calculated its unemployment insurance tax and is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
we have timely appealed the ruling by the edd and are working with our outside counsel to resolve this matter 
we accrued a portion of the increased tax during the fourth quarter of fiscal however  management believes that it has strong defenses and legal arguments with respect to approximately million of the assessment and accordingly has not accrued for that portion of the assessment as of october  or october  franchise agents share of gross profit franchise agents share of gross profit represents the net distribution paid to franchise agents based either on a percentage of the sales or gross profit generated by the franchise agents operations 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  franchise agents share of gross profit was for both fiscal and fiscal in november  we sold one of our franchise agents operations  representing four franchise offices  back to the franchise agent 
revenue for this franchise agent comprised of total domestic revenue for the fiscal year ended october  in august  we sold one additional franchise agent operation  representing two franchise offices  back to the franchise agent 
year to date fiscal revenue for this franchise agent through the date of the sale comprised approximately of our fiscal domestic revenue 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal  due primarily to investments in new and existing personnel along with associated benefits and payroll taxes 
as a percentage of revenue  selling and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal we are continuing our investment in our field office staff  increasing full time equivalent positions by approximately as of the end of fiscal as compared to the prior year end 
these staff increases have been made to support the development of our domestic permanent placement line of business along with increasing staff in selected offices to help support future growth and business development 
additionally  we have increased staffing to support the implementation of our new business process management system 
the fiscal fourth quarter included million of costs associated with a restructure  while the fiscal second quarter included separation costs of million for our former chief executive officer 
selling and administrative expenses in the second quarter of fiscal were reduced by a million gain on the sale of the executive headquarters building in walnut creek  california 
the fiscal fourth quarter included costs of million associated with an unfavorable arbitration ruling 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased million or  primarily due to assets becoming fully depreciated  partially offset by higher depreciation starting in the fourth quarter associated with the portions of our bpm system that have been placed in service 
interest expense interest expense decreased million for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower average borrowings outstanding during the year partially offset by higher average interest rates 
income tax provision we record income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
a valuation allowance is established when management determines it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable in the foreseeable future 
at october   substantially all of our net deferred tax assets were offset with a valuation allowance of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
as a result of our positive domestic earnings in fiscal and  the favorable projected earnings outlook  our long term history of profitability as well as the improvements in our financial position  we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
accordingly during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed our full  domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million  which resulted in an increase in net income for fiscal of million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources we require significant amounts of working capital to operate our business and to pay expenses relating to employment of temporary employees 
our traditional use of cash is for financing of accounts receivable  particularly during periods of economic upswings and growth and during periods where sales are seasonally high 
temporary personnel are generally paid on a weekly basis while payments from customers are generally received to days after billing 
we finance our operations primarily through cash generated by our operating activities and borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the fiscal year ended october   compared to million for the fiscal year ended october  the largest portion of the fiscal cash provided by operating activities was generated from managing receivables  which provided million of the operating cash flow 
our days sales outstanding  or dso  was significantly reduced as compared to fiscal year end cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures  which is primarily for bpm system initiatives  other software  computers and peripherals  and office furniture and equipment  was million of this amount during fiscal we continue to invest in enhancements and upgrades to our computer based technologies 
during fiscal  we entered into a license agreement for a domestic bpm system which is being implemented in three phases 
the initial phase  which consisted of the human resources system for regular westaff employees  was successfully implemented in july the second phase  which includes the core financial systems and the accounts receivable module  went live in the beginning of fiscal year the final phase  which will include fully integrated front office functionality along with payroll and billing for temporary associates  is currently scheduled to go live in the fourth quarter of fiscal capital expenditures associated with this system implementation were approximately million during fiscal year in addition  we made certain technology infrastructure upgrades in our australian operation during fiscal and are also in the process of implementing a new front office system in our united kingdom operation 
our credit agreement currently allows up to a maximum of million in capital expenditures for fiscal in addition  cash used by investing activities in fiscal included million for a westaff franchise located in houston  texas 
we believe the terms and conditions of the preexisting relationship were consistent with other relationships we have with other franchisees  and accordingly have not recorded a settlement gain or loss 
the transaction resulted in us recording million of franchise rights  million of non compete agreements  and million of goodwill 
we have generated cash in the past through sales of company owned offices to franchise owners or sales of franchise agent and license offices back to the franchise agent or license owner 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we sold one of our franchise agents operations back to the franchise agent for cash proceeds of million 
we secured the franchise agents note payable obligation to the bank that funded the purchase through a million letter of credit that declines as the note obligation is paid by the franchise agent 
as of october   the balance on the letter of credit was million 
the million gain on the sale of the franchise operations has been deferred  and is being recognized as the note obligation payments are made 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we sold an additional franchise agent s operations to the franchise agent for cash proceeds and a net gain of million 
as noted above in discontinued operations  in june  we sold our norway and denmark operations for net proceeds of approximately million

the escrowed funds  net of any claim payments  will be remitted to us in june the proceeds received were used to pay down borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we recorded a net gain on the sale of million 
no similar sale occurred during fiscal cash used for financing activities was million in fiscal and million in fiscal in both years  the primary cause behind this usage was repayments under our lines of credit  which amounted to million in fiscal and million in fiscal in may  we entered into agreements with ge capital  as primary agent  to provide senior secured multicurrency credit facilities that originally expired in may the credit facility comprised a five year syndicated credit agreement the multicurrency credit agreement consisting of a million us revolving loan commitment  a million uk revolving loan commitment uk dollar equivalent of approximately million at the date of the agreement  and a million term loan  which was repaid during fiscal in addition  a five year australian dollar facility agreement the a facility agreement was executed on may   consisting of an a million revolving credit facility us dollar equivalent of approximately million at the date of the a facility agreement

additionally  the amendment increased the maximum capital expenditures allowed for fiscal from million to million and also increased the letter of credit sub limit from million to million 
in march  we and our lenders executed an eighth amendment to the multicurrency credit agreement 
among other things  the amendment reset minimum ebitda covenants for fiscal and beyond  adjusted the fixed charge coverage ratio for our second quarter of fiscal  extended the credit facility for one additional year to may and added an additional pricing grid that will allow us to benefit from reduced interest rates and letter of credit fees upon achieving certain minimum ebitda targets

among other things  this amendment reduces the interest rates if certain financial benchmarks are achieved and resets the future minimum ebitda covenants 
the amendment extended the credit facility for one additional year to may we were not in compliance with its minimum ebitda covenant as of the end of fiscal  and the amendment included a waiver of this covenant violation 
on january   we and our lenders executed an amendment to the a facility agreement  which extended the agreement for two additional years to may as of october   we had million outstanding under our credit facilities all of which was outstanding under the a facility agreement 
we have combined available borrowing capacity under our credit facilities of million consisting of million for the us  million for the us and million for australia

we have an unsecured subordinated promissory note payable to our principal stockholder and chairman of the board of directors in the amount of million with a maturity date of august   and an interest rate equal to an indexed rate as calculated under our credit facilities plus seven percent at october   compounded monthly and payable calendar days after the end of each of our fiscal quarters 
payment of interest is contingent on us meeting minimum availability requirements under our credit facilities 
additionally  payments of principal or interest are prohibited in the event of any default under the credit facilities 
the sixth amendment to our multicurrency credit agreement provides for optional prepayment of the note subject to certain borrowing availability limits on the us revolving loan commitment portion of the credit facilities 
we work to balance our worldwide cash needs through dividends from and loans to our international subsidiaries 
these loans and dividends are limited by the cash availability and needs of each respective subsidiary  restrictions imposed by our senior secured debt facilities and  in some cases  statutory regulations of the subsidiary 
the us operations cannot directly draw on the excess borrowing availability of the uk or australian operations  however  we may request dividends from the uk during fiscal  the uk utilized cash from operations and excess borrowing capacity to pay dividends to the us totaling million 
the us can also request repayments on its intercompany loan to australia  along with intercompany interest and royalties  although remittances from australia may be limited by certain covenants under the terms of the australia credit facility 
outstanding principal on the intercompany loan to australia was million as of october   and million as of october  we are responsible for and pay workers compensation costs for our domestic temporary and regular employees and are self insured for the deductible amount related to workers compensation claims  per claim for fiscal years and and  per claim for fiscal 
generally speaking  each policy year the terms of the agreement with the insurance carrier are renegotiated 
the insurance carrier requires us to collateralize our obligations through the use of irrevocable standby letters of credit  surety bonds or cash 
in april  our insurance carrier reduced our collateral requirements for us through the cancellation of a million surety bond thereby eliminating any remaining outstanding surety bond 
currently  we do not believe that surety bonds will be available or required in the foreseeable future to secure workers compensation obligations 
under the terms of our policy year agreement  we made cash payments totaling million  paid in equal monthly installments  which commenced on november  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we and our insurance carrier negotiated the return of million of the fiscal cash collateral and we issued million of letters of credit in its place 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we issued an additional million of letters of credit in exchange for million in cash  which represented all of the cash remaining in the collateral fund 
for our policy year insurance program  we anticipate total cash payments of million will be paid during fiscal in equal monthly installments  which commenced on november  cash payments for policy year claims will be paid directly by us 
as of january  we had outstanding million of letters of credit to secure all outstanding obligations under our workers compensation program for all years except  which is fully funded although subject to annual retroactive premium adjustments based on actual claims activity 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to increase our letters of credit by million 
we will also make ongoing cash payments for claims for all other open policy years except for as noted above 
we continue to evaluate other opportunities to further strengthen our financial position 
however  we believe that the borrowing capacity provided under the amended credit agreement  together with cash generated through our operating performance  will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements none

payments under the promissory note are subject to certain restrictions regarding borrowing capacity and compliance within our senior secured credit facilities 
workers compensation obligations for policy year are based on estimates 
if actual results differ from these estimates  we could be required to make additional payments to  or receive refunds from  our insurance carrier in years subsequent to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks from transactions that are entered into during the normal course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
at october   our outstanding debt under variable rate interest borrowings was approximately million 
a change of two percentage points in the interest rates would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is not significant with respect to interest income  as our investment portfolio is not material to our consolidated balance sheet 
we currently have no plans to hold an investment portfolio that includes derivative financial instruments 
for the fiscal year ended october   our international operations comprised of our revenue and  as of the end of that period  of our total assets 
we are exposed to foreign currency risk primarily due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our multicurrency credit facility  which allows our australian and united kingdom subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies  partially mitigates the exchange rate risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency denominated net investments in these subsidiaries in relation to the us dollar 
we do not currently hold any market risk sensitive instruments entered into for hedging transaction risks related to foreign currencies 
in addition  we have not entered into any transactions with derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
