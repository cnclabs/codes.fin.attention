item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a nationwide  high availability  multi vendor enterprise maintenance service and solutions provider for enterprises  including business  global services providers  governmental agencies and other organizations 
we have undertaken significant changes to our business in recent years 
after selling the operational outsourcing division in  we began the shift of our business to a predominantly services model 
in september  we completed the acquisition of alphanational technology services  inc and in august  we completed the acquisition of microserv  inc these acquisitions significantly expanded our geographic base  strengthened our nationwide service delivery capabilities  bolstered management depth  and added several prestigious customers 
on june   we sold our secure network services business 
we undertook this sale to leverage the valuations in federal government properties and to enable us to focus our resources and management on our core business of high availability maintenance services and technology deployment and integration services 
the proceeds from this transaction were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness and provide working capital 
we offer a growing list of services to businesses  global service providers  governmental agencies and other organizations 
our services are customized to meet each customer s needs providing xx service  personnel with required security clearances for certain governmental programs  project management services  depot repair and roll out services 
we believe the flexible services we offer to our customers enable us to tailor solutions to obtain maximum efficiencies within their budgeting constraints 
we incurred a loss for year ended march   primarily as a result a loss in our fourth quarter from an equipment roll out project  a charge to increase our reserve for obsolete inventory  and a charge to record valuation reserve against our deferred tax asset 
the increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory resulted from changes in the mix of the equipment that we support  as a result of technology upgrades by our customers 
services revenues includes monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
revenues related to the fixed price service agreements are recognized ratably over the lives of the agreements 
amounts billed in advance of the services period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
losses on contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the losses become determinable 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
this may result in a cash short fall that may impact our working capital and financing 
this may also cause fluctuations in operating results as start up costs are expensed as incurred 
see risk factors we incur significant costs in connection with the start up of new contracts before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls and fluctuations in quarterly results from period to period 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product sales are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
our goal is to return to and maintain profitable operations  expand our customer base of clients through our existing global service provider partners  seek new global service provider partners  and enhance the technology we utilize to deliver cost effective services to our growing customer base 
our ability to increase profitability will be impacted by our ability to continue to compete within the industry  and our ability to replace contracts which were sold in connection with the sale of the secure network services business 
we must also effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
we must continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  re engineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques  particularly within costs of services  selling  marketing and general and administrative expenses 
our future operating results may be affected by a number of factors including uncertainties relative to national economic conditions and terrorism  especially as they affect interest rates  the reduction in revenue as a result of the sale of our secure network services business  industry factors and our ability to successfully increase our sales of services  accurately estimate costs when bidding on a contract  and effectively manage expenses 
we have streamlined our service delivery process  expanded our depot repair facility to repair rather than purchase new component parts and are working with our customers to modify the processes under which services are rendered to our customers 
we plan to effectively manage expenses in relation to revenues by directing new business development towards markets that complement or improve our existing service lines 
management must also continue to emphasize operating efficiencies through cost containment strategies  reengineering efforts and improved service delivery techniques 
the industry in which we operate has experienced unfavorable economic conditions and competitive challenges 
our and operating results reflect the impact of this challenging environment 
we continue to experience significant price competition and customer demand for higher service attainment levels 
in addition  there is significant price competition in the market for state and local government contracts as a result of budget issues  political pressure and other factors beyond our control 
it has been our experience that longevity and quality of service may have little influence in the customer decision making process 
consolidated results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal years ended march   and and financial condition as of march  and we operate as a single business segment  whereby we provide high availability maintenance services  and technology deployment and integration for commercial and governmental clients 
on june   we completed the sale of our secure network services business 
the results of operations for our secure network services business has been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

services revenues include monthly recurring fixed unit price contracts as well as time and material contracts 
amounts billed in advance of the service period are recorded as unearned revenues and recognized when earned 
the revenues and related expenses associated with product held for resale are recognized when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer 
product held for resale consists of hardware and software 
the components of revenues are as follows march  amounts in thousands change change revenues services product held for resale total revenues during fiscal year  total revenues decreased  or million  to million compared to million in fiscal year product held for resale decreased from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  or a decrease 
in fiscal year total revenues decreased due to the termination of a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract that was terminated in april  which was partially offset by new more profitable business  and lower revenues from product held for resale as we continue to de emphasize product sales 
fiscal year total revenues increased  or million  to million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in revenues in was attributable to the start up of a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract 
product held for resale increased by  or  during fiscal year to million compared to million in the increase in product held for resale in fiscal year was from some large one time orders 
operating costs and expenses included within operating costs and expenses are direct costs  including fringe benefits  product and part costs  and other costs 
a large part of our service costs are support costs and expenses that include direct labor and infrastructure costs to support our service offerings 
although operating costs decreased in fiscal year  we anticipate that the direct costs to support these service offerings will continue to increase as a result of the impact of inflation and energy costs as well as costs incurred as we continue to support new and expanded service offerings 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  part costs vary depending upon the call volume received from customers during the period 
many of these costs are volume driven and as volume increases  these costs as a percentage of revenues increase  generating a negative impact to profit margins 
the variable component of these costs are product and part costs  overtime  subcontracted work and freight 
product is separated into two categories parts and equipment to support our service base and product held for resale 
part costs are highly variable and are dependent on several factors 
on long term fixed unit price contracts  parts and peripherals are consumed on service calls 
for installation services and seat management services  product may consist of hardware  software  cabling and other materials that are components of the service performed 
product held for resale consists of hardware and software 
operating costs and expenses consists of the following components march  amounts in thousands change change services delivery and support product held for resale total direct costs indirect costs operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses decreased in fiscal year  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal year in relation to the decrease in revenues  as we shifted to more profitable contracts 
costs of services increased in fiscal year  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in direct costs was due to increases in salaries and overtime costs related to the large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  partially offset by lower costs in product held for resale as a result of lower revenue volumes in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year when comparing fiscal year to fiscal year the large decease in costs of services in fiscal year was primarily the result of the elimination of the revenue and the costs associated with a large nation wide high availability maintenance contract 
conversely  in comparing fiscal year to fiscal year the increase in costs during fiscal year was associated with the aforementioned contract which was terminated in april during fiscal year  our cost of services  delivery and support decreased  or million  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year  as a result of the decrease in revenue  primarily as a result to the contract termination discussed above 
during fiscal year  our cost of services delivery and support increased by million from million during fiscal year to million in fiscal year the increase in services delivery and support was related to the costs associated with a large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract that was unprofitable 
other increased costs that are initially incurred at the start of a new contract that are difficult to measure  such as increased repair times due to becoming familiar with new product sets and higher call volumes which are inherent when one switches service providers  normally decrease over time and result in savings over the term of the contract 
the anticipated decrease in costs did not materialize 
we also experienced higher than anticipated failure rates on certain pieces of equipment  which contributed to the poor performance on this contract and operating results for the fiscal year 
during fiscal years and  we continued to see pressure on gross margins on product held for resale due to the competitively priced product market experienced during these periods 
the costs of product held for resale decreased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  primarily as a result of decreased revenues 
during fiscal year  the cost of product held for resale increased  to million from million in fiscal year due to increased revenue 
the gross margin on product held for resale was  or in fiscal year   or in fiscal year  and  or in fiscal year indirect costs include costs related to operating our call center  logistics  dispatch operations  facility costs and other costs incurred to support the field service technicians and engineers 
indirect costs increased  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year  a increase 
the increase in indirect costs was primarily attributable to a charge to increase our reserve related to obsolete inventory 
the charge for obsolete inventory was  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year the increase in the reserve for obsolete inventory resulted from changes in the mix of the equipment that we support  as a result of technology upgrades by our customers 
during fiscal year  indirect costs decreased by  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year gross margin as a percent of revenues  the gross margin percent was for fiscal year  for fiscal year and for fiscal year  respectively 
gross margins improved  or  from fiscal year primarily as a result of improved profitability on existing contracts  however gross margins were negatively affected by the obsolete inventory charge and  in addition  a loss in our fourth quarter from an equipment roll out project 
gross margins increased  or million  in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year the increase in gross margins in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year was the result of increased revenues and cost containment actions undertaken 
we continue to work to increase revenues  continue in our cost reduction efforts and deploy technology to gain operating efficiencies in order to remain competitive 
we expect that the continued shift from product held for resale towards long term service contracts will have a positive effect on our gross margins over the long term  and such margins will improve as we continue to increase our enterprise maintenance solutions base 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  travel costs and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales 
selling and marketing expenses decreased  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year for fiscal years and  selling and marketing expense was million and million  respectively 
the primary reason for the decrease in selling and marketing costs was decreases in personnel costs and commissions and curtailed marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of non allocated overhead costs 
these costs include executive  accounting  contract administration  professional services  such as legal and audit  business insurance  occupancy and other costs 
general and administrative expense decreased  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the decrease in general and administration expenses during fiscal year was the result of lower payroll costs  depreciation expense and occupancy costs 
during fiscal year  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year this decrease was a result of cost control efforts  including employment actions  and staff reductions 
in spite of vigorous cost containment efforts  various factors  such as changes in insurance markets  related costs associated with complying with new securities and exchange commission regulations and the american stock exchange requirements may increase general and administrative expenses which will have a negative impact on our earnings in fiscal year and future periods 
severance costs and abandonment of lease during the year ended march   we recorded severance costs for employees working on several contracts that expired of approximately in conjunction with the acquisition of alphanational technology services  inc  we conducted a review of our facility requirements and determined that after the completion of the acquisition we would have excess space 
during september  we recorded a charge for abandonment of facility of approximately  related to the sub leasing of rental office space 
we leased the excess space effective october  the abandonment charge was net of minimum sub lease rents of approximately  operating income loss for the year ended march   the operating income was compared to an operating loss of million for the year ended march  the lack of operating income for fiscal year was the result of an increased charge for inventory obsolescence and costs in excess of revenues associated with an equipment roll out contract in the fourth quarter 
we incurred an operating loss of million in fiscal year compared an operating loss of million in fiscal year the operating loss for fiscal year was the result of on going losses in connection with the performance of an unprofitable large nation wide enterprise maintenance contract  which was terminated in april  and related severance costs 
the operating loss in fiscal year was primarily due to the losses incurred on the large  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract previously discussed  increases in our allowance for inventory obsolescence and the abandonment of certain office space 
interest expense interest expense increased from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year due to higher monthly borrowing activities compared to fiscal year and increases in the prime rate of interest 
during fiscal year  interest expense decreased  from  in fiscal year to  in fiscal year primarily due to lower interest rates 
income tax expense benefit as a result of recording a valuation reserve on our deferred tax asset during fiscal year  we recorded a provision for income taxes of million  compared to an income tax benefit of  in fiscal year during fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal year for fiscal year  we recorded a tax benefit of million and tax expense for discontinued operations of  at march   the deferred tax asset was compared to a deferred tax asset of million at march  note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
income from discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the secure networks services business in june  the results of operations of such business have been classified as discontinued operations for fiscal years and income from discontinued operations was  and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
gain on sale of discontinued operations we completed the sale of our secure network services business on june  as a requirement of the sale of our secure network services business  we deferred the recognition of the gain on the sale until certain contract contingencies related to the novation of a key contract were obtained 
on january   the final novations were received and the contingencies resolved 
as a result of the foregoing  we have recorded a gain on the sale of discontinued operations during fiscal year  net of taxes of million  of approximately million 
net loss income we reported net loss of million in fiscal year  
per share 
as discussed previously  the loss was principally the result of a loss on an equipment roll out project in the fourth quarter  a charge to increase our reserve for inventory obsolescence  and a charge to record a valuation reserve on our deferred tax asset 
as a result of income from discontinued operations and the gain on the sale of discontinued operations partially offset by the loss from continuing operations  we reported net income of million for fiscal year or  earnings per share of 
basic and diluted 
as discussed above the principal reasons for the loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal year  were the losses incurred on a long term  nation wide  enterprise maintenance contract  and severance related costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization was  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
during fiscal year  depreciation and amortization decreased approximately  compared to fiscal year the decrease in depreciation expense was due to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and price decreases in new equipment resulting in lower expense 
we continue to focus the majority of our capital spending on technology enhancements that will increase operating efficiencies 
sale of secure network services business on june   we simultaneously entered into and closed on an asset purchase agreement the agreement with indus corporation indus pursuant to which we sold substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of our secure network services business 
the purchase price was approximately million  in addition to adjustments for working capital of approximately  for total consideration of approximately million 
as a result of receiving notification that the key contract had been novated  we recorded a gain on the sale of the secure network services business after taxes  fees and costs of approximately million net of income taxes of approximately million during our fiscal year ended march  as a result of the sale of the secure network services business  we utilized a portion of its net operating loss carryforward of approximately million in fiscal year ended march  and had reduced our deferred tax asset accordingly 
the asset purchase agreement contains representations  warranties  covenants and related indemnification provisions  in each case that are customary in connection with a transaction of this type  however  certain of the representations and warranties required updating to a date which is the earlier of the contract novation or thirty months from the closing 
in addition  survival periods applicable to such updated warranties may be extended together with related indemnification periods 
approximately  of the original escrow amount plus interest remains in escrow as security for the payment of our indemnification obligations pursuant to the asset purchase agreement and is classified as restricted cash in the accompanying financial statements 
on december   we received a notice of claim from indus  pursuant to which indus alleged various breaches of certain representations and warranties in the agreement by us 
indus takes the position that these alleged breaches entitle indus to indemnification 
as a result  indus further takes the position that the entire amount remaining in escrow which totaled  including interest  should be disbursed to indus 
we delivered a response notice to the escrow agent and indus and disputed the claims of indus set forth in its notice of claim 
we believe the claim is without merit 
on june  we filed a complaint against indus in the virginia circuit court requesting a declaratory judgment  and other relief  including a demand that indus withdraw its claim and disburse the funds in escrow 
no adjustments to the accompanying financial statements have been made relating to this matter 
liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had approximately million of cash on hand 
sources of our cash in fiscal have been from cash generated from operations and from our revolving credit facility 
we are continuing to focus on our core high availability maintenance services business while at the same time evaluating our future strategic direction 
as part of our business strategy  we intend on reducing our indebtedness 
we anticipate that our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal will be cash generated from operations and cash available to us under our revolving credit agreement 
cash generated from operations may be affected by a number of factors 
see risk factors for a discussion of the factors that can negatively impact the amount of cash we generate from our operations 
although we have no definite plans to undertake any future debt or equity financing  we will continue to evaluate all potential funding alternatives 
among the possibilities for raising additional funds are issuances of debt or equity securities  and other borrowings under secured or unsecured credit facilities 
there can be no assurances that additional funds will be available to us on acceptable terms or the timing thereof 
our future financial performance will depend on our ability to continue to reduce and manage operating expenses  as well as our ability to grow revenues through obtaining new contracts and replacing contracts sold in connection with the sale of the secure networks services business 
our revenues will continue to be impacted by the loss of customers due to price competition and technological advances 
our future financial performance could be negatively affected by unforeseen factors and unplanned expenses 
see risk factors 
in furtherance of our business strategy  transactions we may enter into could increase or decrease our liquidity at any point in time 
if we were to obtain a significant contract or make contract modifications  we may be required to expend our cash or incur debt  which will decrease our liquidity 
conversely  if we dispose of assets  we may receive proceeds from such sales which could increase our liquidity 
from time to time  we are in discussions concerning acquisitions and dispositions which  if consummated  could impact our liquidity  perhaps significantly 
we expect to continue to require funds to meet remaining interest and principal payment obligations  capital expenditures and other non operating expenses 
see the discussion below including the contractual obligations table 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including revenue growth  expansion of our service offerings and business strategy 
we believe that our available funds  together with our existing revolving credit facility  will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations for at least through fiscal year we are in process of the completing the review of alternative sources of financing  which may replace our existing credit facilities if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants in the future 
the table below reflects our liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands cash balance at march working capital at march net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investment activities net cash provided by used in financing activities at march   we had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at march  the current ratio was at march  compared to at march  on june  we sold our secure network services business for million 
the gain on the sale of the business was million net of taxes and fees 
the net cash after taxes and fees was approximately million 
the proceeds were used to reduce debt and provide working capital 
capital expenditures in fiscal year were  and in fiscal year were  we anticipate fiscal year technology requirements to result in capital expenditures totaling approximately  we continue to sublease a portion of our headquarters building which reduces our rent expense by approximately  annually 
a summary of future minimum lease payments is set forth below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
on june   we and our subsidiaries entered into the fourth amended and restated loan and security agreement  referred to as the revolving credit agreement with provident bank 
the maturity date is june  the maximum amount available under the revolving credit agreement is million 
as of march   million was outstanding under the previous revolving credit agreement 
amounts outstanding under the new revolving credit agreement will bear interest at provident bank s prime rate plus one quarter percent 
we will also pay an unused commitment fee on the difference between the maximum amount we can borrow and the amount advanced  determined by the average daily amount outstanding during the period 
the difference is multiplied by one quarter percent 
this amount is payable on the last day of each quarter until the revolving credit agreement has been terminated 
additionally  we will pay a fee of  per month 
advances under the revolving credit agreement are collateralized by a first priority security interest on all of our assets as defined in the revolving credit agreement 
the interest rate at march  was the revolving credit agreement contains representations  warranties and covenants that are customary in connection with a transaction of this type 
the revolving credit agreement contains certain covenants including  but not limited to i maintaining our accounts in a cash collateral account at provident bank  the funds in which accounts we may apply in our discretion against our obligations owed to provident bank  ii notifying provident bank in writing of any cancellation of a contract having annual revenues in excess of  iii in the event receivables arise out of government contracts  we will assign to provident bank all government contracts with amounts payable of  or greater and in duration of six months or longer  iv obtaining written consent from provident bank prior to permitting a change in ownership of more than of the stock or other equity interests of us and our subsidiaries or permit us or any of such entities to enter into any merger or consolidation or sell or lease substantially all of our or its assets  v obtaining prior written consent of provident bank  subject to exceptions  to make payments of debt to any person or entity or making any distributions of any kind to any officers  employees or members  and vi obtaining written consent from provident bank prior to entering into or amending any contract with ibm or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates concerning work performed for certain entities 
the revolving credit agreement also contains certain financial covenants which we are required to maintain including  but not limited to tangible net worth plus subordinated debt of not less than million  a current ratio of greater than  total liabilities to net worth ratio of not greater than  and a debt service coverage equal to or greater than  as more fully described in the revolving credit agreement 
events of default  include  but are not limited to i a determination by provident bank that in its discretion the financial condition of us or any person or entity that generally is now or hereafter liable  directly  contingently or otherwise obligated to pay provident bank under the revolving credit agreement other obligor is unsatisfactory  ii we or an other obligor becomes insolvent or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy filed against it  iii a default under any indebtedness by us or any other obligor  and iv a change in more than of the ownership of us without the prior written consent of provident bank

provident bank is also authorized  upon a default  but without prior notice to or demand upon us and without prior opportunity of us to be heard  to institute an action for replevin  with or without bond as provident bank may elect to obtain possession of any of the collateral 
at march   we were not in compliance with the financial covenants contained in our revolving credit agreement 
we requested and received a waiver from our bank for our non compliance with these financial covenants at march  and june  there is no assurance we will be in compliance in the future or  if not in compliance  that the bank will waive any future non compliance with the covenants 
we are in process of the completing the review of alternative sources of financing  which may replace our existing credit facilities if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants in the future 
as a result of the non compliance with its covenants and no assurances that the company will be able to comply with its covenants beyond june   the revolving credit agreement has been reclassified as a current obligation 
we also extended the maturity of our auxiliary line of credit of million from july  to december  if our customer base were to remain constant  we expect to have approximately million available on our revolving credit agreement through the next twelve months 
if we were to obtain a significant new contract or make contract modifications  our borrowing availability may be less since we are generally required to invest significant funds in initial start up situations 
the revolving credit agreement prohibits the payment of dividends or distributions as well as limits the payment of principal or interest on our subordinated debt  which is not paid until we obtain a waiver from the bank 
our subordinated debt agreements with nancy scurlock and the arch c 
scurlock children s trust  which are our affiliates  totaled million in the aggregate at march  and at march  pursuant to a subordination agreement between provident bank and the subordinated debt holders  principal repayment and interest payable on the subordinated debt agreements may not be paid without the consent of provident bank 
on june  we amended our promissory notes to extend the maturity date to july  all other terms and conditions on the promissory notes remain the same 
if any act of default occurs  the principal and interest due under the promissory notes issued under the subordinated debt agreement will be due and payable immediately without any action on behalf of the note holders and if not cured  could trigger cross default provisions under our loan agreement with provident bank 
if we do not make a payment of any installment of interest or principal when it becomes due and payable  we are in default 
if we breach or default in the performance of any covenants contained in the notes and continuance of such breach or default for a period of days after the notice to us by the note holders or breach or default in any of the terms of borrowings by us constituting superior indebtedness  unless waived in writing by the holder of such superior indebtedness within the period provided in such indebtedness not to exceed days  we would be in default on the promissory notes 
provident bank approved  and we made payments totaling  and  during fiscal years and  respectively  for accrued interest on the subordinated debt 
interest payable to the affiliates was approximately  and  at march  and  respectively 
the following are our contractual obligations associated with lease commitments  debt obligations and consulting commitments as of march  amounts in thousands bank other consulting operating debt debt commitment leases total less than year to years to years more than years total included in our bank debt at march  is our bank line of credit of  and  in addition  we have an auxiliary line of credit totaling million  the maturity of which was extended to december  at march   affiliates see note to the consolidated financial statements  held in the aggregate  and  face amount of our subordinated notes dated november  and november   respectively 
these notes are subordinate to our revolving credit agreement and we cannot make principal or interest payments on such notes without the consent of provident bank 
we are obligated under a capitalized lease for phone equipment with a term of sixty months 
the note carries interest of 
the balance of the note on march  was  we have a consulting advisory service commitment with a former chief executive officer of the company 
from april  through march   we are to pay the former chief executive officer  per year for consulting services 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with a government contract  we act as a conduit in a financing transaction on behalf of a third party 
we routinely transfer receivables to a third party in connection with equipment sold to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales  and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to us for the receivables by the transferee is equal to our carrying value and therefore no gain or loss is recognized on these transfers 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and us  for various services provided to the end users 
we provide limited monthly servicing whereby we invoice the end user on behalf of the transferee 
the off balance sheet transactions had no impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
we are not aware of any event  demand or uncertainty that would likely terminate the agreement or have an adverse affect on our operations 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements as they affect the updated amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as policies that involve critical accounting estimates that require i management to make assumptions that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and ii different estimates that could have been reasonably used for the current period  or changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or in results of operations 
based on this definition  our most critical policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  which impact cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  which impact write offs of goodwill and intangibles  depreciation of property and equipment  and income taxes and the related valuation allowance 
we discuss these policies further below  as well as the estimates and management s judgments involved 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  to make judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe that the estimates and judgments generally required by these policies are not as difficult or subjective and are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition we recognize service revenues based on contracted fees earned  net of credits and adjustments  as the service is performed 
revenues from long term fixed unit price contracts are recognized monthly as service is performed based upon the number of units covered and the level of service requested 
the pricing in these contracts is fixed as to the unit price but varies based upon the number of units covered and service level requested 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are recognized as services are delivered 
certain seat management contracts include the delivery and installation of new equipment combined with multi year service agreements 
revenues related to the delivery and installation of equipment under these and certain other contracts are recognized upon the completion of both the delivery and installation 
invoices billed in advance are recognized as revenues when earned 
revenues are a function of the mix of long term services contracts and time and material and professional service contracts 
revenues from time and material professional service contracts are difficult to forecast because of wide fluctuations in demand 
the long term contracts are more predictable and  as a result  the revenue stream is less difficult to forecast 
the gross margins on long term contracts vary inversely with the call volume received from customers in any one reporting period 
our expectation is that we will see continued growth in long term contracts  which historically have had higher gross margins  and continued downward pressure on hardware and software margins 
provisions for loss contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
inventory valuation reserves we write down inventory and record obsolescence reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon anticipated future usage  prior demand  equipment use  current and anticipated contracts and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecast for inventory usage  a significant unanticipated change in technology could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported value 
if actual demand is less than anticipated  or if our prior usage to support our contracts and anticipated future demand changes  we would be required to record additional inventory reserves  which would have a negative impact on our gross margins 
for the last three years  our inventory reserve ranged from to of inventory 
based upon our historical experience  the charge for fiscal year is budgeted to be approximately  or to of inventory 
a change in estimate would have an impact on earnings of approximately  due to changes in the mix of equipment that our customers use  economic uncertainties and the dramatic decreases in the cost for computing equipment  we increased our reserve for inventory obsolescence 
the amount charged to expense for inventory obsolescence was approximately  in fiscal year  compared to  in fiscal year allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances and our historical write off experience  net of recoveries 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
we believe the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because changes in it can significantly affect net income and treatment of the allowance requires us to anticipate the economic viability of our customers and requires a degree of judgment 
during fiscal year the amount we recorded as an allowance for bad debt was approximately  or of our annual revenues 
a change in the estimate by would have an impact on earnings of approximately  over the past three years bad debts expense represented approximately to of revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets during our fiscal year ended march   we adopted sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly we no longer amortize goodwill  but continue to amortize other acquisition related intangible assets 
during fiscal year  amortization of acquisition related intangibles was  up from  in fiscal year we assign useful lives for long lived assets based on periodic studies of actual asset lives and our intended use for those assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate these carrying values may not be recoverable 
any changes in these asset lives would be reported in our statement of operations as soon as any change in estimate is determined 
our impairment review is based on the applicable valuation methods  including the income and market approaches 
halifax operates as a single reporting unit for financial reporting purposes 
under this method  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value inclusive of goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value there is no impairment and no further analysis is necessary 
if our revenues and cost forecasts are not achieved  we fail to have continued profitability and market acceptance  or the market conditions in the stock market cause the valuation to decline  we may incur charges for impairment of goodwill 
in december  our annual assessment of goodwill and intangible assets was conducted to test for impairment  and we concluded that there was no impairment 
property and equipment we estimate the useful lives of property and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of our equipment is depreciated over three to ten years 
the estimated useful lives are based on historical experience with similar assets as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization in future periods 
we review for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable over the remaining lives of the assets 
in assessing impairments  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  utilizing cash flows which take into account management s estimates of future operations 
income taxes and valuation allowance deferred income taxes are provided for the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts recognized for income tax purposes 
we measure assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that  if changed  would result in either an increase or decrease in the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
a valuation allowance is recorded when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the likelihood of realization  management considers estimates of future taxable income  the character of income needed to realize future tax benefits  historical financial results adjusted for non recurring items and all other available evidence 
management believes that based on the weight of the evidence  including estimates of future profitability  that a valuation allowance should be recorded against the deferred tax asset 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains an analysis of our deferred tax assets 
management will continue to monitor its historical results when adjusted for non recurring items  estimates of future profitability and all other evidence to assess the realizability of its net deferred tax assets based on evolving business conditions 
should management determine it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we would reduce the valuation allowance 
results of operations and forward looking statements our other results of operations and other forward looking statements contained herein involve a number of risks and uncertainties  in particular  plans to cultivate new business  the ability to expand our footprint  revenues  pricing  gross margins and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  and potential future impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the factors discussed above  other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include but are not limited to the following business and economic conditions in the areas we serve  possible disruption in commercial activities related to terrorist activities  reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  pricing pressures and excess or obsolete inventory and variations in inventory value recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of bank debt to finance our business 
the floating interest rate exposes us to interest rate risk  with the primary interest rate exposure resulting from changes in the prime rate 
it is assumed in the table below that the prime rate will remain constant in the future 
adverse changes in the interest rates or our inability to refinance our long term obligations may have a material negative impact on our operations 
the definitive extent of our interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
we do not believe such risk is material 
we do not customarily use derivative instruments to adjust our interest rate risk profile 
the information below summarizes our sensitivity to market risks as of march  the table presents principal cash flows and related interest rates by year of maturity of our funded debt

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as allowances for doubtful accounts  unbilled accounts receivable  depreciation and amortization  taxes  inventory reserves  goodwill  and contingencies 
accounts receivable receivables are attributable to trade receivables in the ordinary course of business 
allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
see note the company routinely transfers receivables to a third party in connection with equipment sold to end users 
the credit risk passes to the third party at the point of sale of the receivables 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities  transfers were accounted for as sales and as a result  the related receivables have been excluded from the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the amount paid to the company for the receivables by the transferee is equal to the carrying value and therefore no gain or loss is recognized on these transfers 
the end user remits its monthly payments directly to an escrow account held by a third party from which payments are made to the transferee and the company  for various services provided to the end users 
the company provides limited monthly servicing whereby the company invoices the end user on behalf of the transferee 
inventory inventory consists principally of spare computer parts  computer and computer peripherals consumed on maintenance contracts  and hardware and software held for resale to customers 
all inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on the first in first out basis

losses on contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which they become determinable 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is the total of the current year income taxes due or refundable and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  along with net operating loss carryforwards and credit carryforwards if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
to the extent a deferred tax asset cannot be recognized under the preceding criteria  a valuation allowance must be established

item a 
controls and procedures evaluation of the company s disclosure controls and procedures and internal control and financial reporting 
the company evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule a e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act  as of the end of the period covered by this form k disclosure controls 
this evaluation disclosure controls evaluation was done under the supervision and with the participation of management  including the chief executive officer ceo and chief financial officer cfo 
limitations on the effectiveness of controls 
control systems  no matter how well conceived and operated  are designed to provide a reasonable  but not an absolute  level of assurance that the objectives of the control system are met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud  if any  within the company have been detected 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
the company conducts periodic evaluation of its internal controls to enhance  where necessary  its procedures and controls 
conclusions 
as a part of the audit process  the company has determined that control deficiencies in its internal control over financial reporting that existed as of march  constitute a material weakness within the meaning of the public company accounting oversight board s pcaob auditing standard no 
this material weakness in internal control over financial reporting was related to income tax reporting as a result of the lack of qualified personnel to properly review and administer the company s tax matters 
such material weakness was identified  and because management considers its internal controls over financial reporting to intersect with its disclosure controls  the company s ceo and cfo concluded that the company s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of march  in reaching a reasonable level of assurance that i information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the act is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission s rules and forms and ii information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the act is accumulated and communicated to the company s management  including its principal executive and principal financial officers  or persons performing similar functions  as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure 
there was no change in internal controls over financial reporting as defined in rule a f of the act that have materially affected  or are reasonably likely to materially over the company s internal control over financial reporting 
as a result of the material weakness described above  however  management is considering the retention of additional accounting staff or outside consultants to assist in the area of income tax reporting
