table of contents to create healthcare products and environments that provide patients  caregivers and patients families a more comfortable  efficient and conducive healing process 
each of our dealers maintains their own sales force which is complemented by our sales representatives who work closely with the dealers throughout the sales process 
no single independent dealer in north america accounted for more than of our segment revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our segment revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a material effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market due to financial failure  the inability to smoothly transition ownership or termination of the dealer relationship could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
from time to time  we obtain a controlling interest in dealers that are undergoing an ownership transition 
it is typically our intent to divest our interest in these dealerships as soon as it is practical 
in  the north america segment accounted for  or of our total revenue  and at the end of the year had approximately  permanent employees and temporary workers  of which  of the total workers related to manufacturing 
the north america office furniture markets are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
in these markets  companies compete on price  product performance  design  delivery and relationships with customers  architects and designers 
our most significant competitors in the united states are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc  and knoll  inc together with steelcase  these companies represent approximately of the united states office furniture market 
international segment our international segment serves customers outside of the united states and canada primarily under the steelcase brand 
the international office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many different local and regional manufacturers in many different markets 
in many cases  these competitors focus on specific product categories 
the international segment has its greatest presence in europe where we have the leading market share 
the international segment serves customers through approximately independent and company owned dealers 
no single independent dealer in international accounted for more than of our segment revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our segment revenue 
in certain geographic markets the segment sells directly to customers 
in  our international segment accounted for or of our total revenue  and at the end of the year had approximately  permanent employees and temporary workers 
approximately  of the total workers related to manufacturing 
other category the other category includes our design group  polyvision  ideo and financial services subsidiaries 
the design group is comprised of the following three brands focused on providing architects and designers with unique products and premium experiences 
designtex focuses on surface materials including textiles  wall coverings  shades  screens and surface imagings 
brayton focuses on lounge  executive and healthcare seating and tables 
metro creates refined  modern furniture for meeting spaces  private offices and the open plan 

table of contents designtex primarily sells products specified by architects and designers directly to end customers through a direct sales force 
brayton and metro sales are primarily generated through our north america dealer network 
polyvision designs and manufactures visual communications products  such as static and electronic whiteboards 
the majority of polyvision s revenue relates to static whiteboards sold in the primary and secondary education markets 
polyvision s revenues generated from whiteboards and group communication tools are sold through our north america dealer network  and to a greater extent  other audio visual resellers 
polyvision also sells to general contractors through a direct bid process 
ideo provides product design and innovation services to companies in a variety of industries including communications  consumer products  healthcare  information technology and manufacturing among others 
financial services provides leasing services primarily to north america customers and selected financing services to our dealers 
in  the other category accounted for  or of our total revenue 
corporate expenses approximately of corporate expenses are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
unallocated corporate expenses are reported as corporate 
corporate costs include executive and portions of shared service functions such as human resources  finance  legal  research and development and corporate facilities 
joint ventures we enter into joint ventures from time to time to expand our geographic presence or support our distribution network 
as of february   our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures was our portion of the income or loss from the joint ventures is recorded in other income  net  in the consolidated statements of income 
our primary joint ventures include ksm we own of this japanese office furniture manufacturer that supports our distribution in the japanese market 
one workplace we own of this us based dealer that serves customers primarily in the northern california market 
steelcase jeraisy we own of this office furniture manufacturer in saudi arabia that serves customers primarily in the local market 
wsa we own of this dealer located in switzerland that serves customers primarily in the german speaking regions of the country 
workstage we own of this us based company which designs and constructs buildings that focus on the integration of the three core elements of the work environment furniture  interior architecture and technology 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for of our consolidated revenue in and our five largest direct sale customers accounted for of consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies and other entities purchasing under our general services administration contract  which in the aggregate accounted for of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business 

table of contents no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for of our consolidated revenue 
working capital our accounts receivable are primarily from our dealers  and to a lesser degree  direct sale customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our north america segment  and certain markets within the international segment  encourage prompt payment by offering a discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within four to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics we have evolved our manufacturing and overall supply chain significantly over the past several years 
during the rapid growth period of the s and s in the united states  we were uniquely positioned to command a high market share due to our capacity and ability to accept and deliver large orders of furniture 
during this time period  most third party suppliers did not have the capacity and  in many cases  the expertise to make parts and components for our products 
our strategy of vertical integration provided the right formula at the time 
over time  a much more capable supply base emerged  in many cases  in support of the automotive industry 
these third party suppliers located both locally and in lower cost countries have since taken the capabilities they built for their automotive customers and diversified their customer base into other industries like office furniture 
these new  capable suppliers afforded us the opportunity to restructure our industrial model which is increasingly being built on the basis of lean principles emphasizing continuous one piece flow and agility 
portions of the process not conducive to one piece flow continue to be evaluated for potential outsourcing 
this approach has reduced the capital needs of our business  reduced inventories  reduced the footprint of our manufacturing space and  at the same time  allowed us to improve quality  delivery performance and the customer experience 
during to  as a result of our new industrial model and a precipitous drop in industry demand from to  we started to significantly reduce our manufacturing square footage in north america and europe 
this process has continued so that by the end of q  we expect to have reduced our global manufacturing and distribution center square footage by from to approximately million square feet 
at the same time  in order to serve the growth needs of our asian market  we opened a new plant in shenzhen  china in and restructured our production capacity in kuala lumpur  malaysia 
worldwide  we are optimizing across the entire value chain  incorporating both the needs and capabilities of our dealer service partners  supply chain partners and logistics providers 
in the past months  we have opened several regional distribution centers around the united states that allow us to improve service to our customers and dealers and reduce freight cost throughout the value stream 
raw materials and suppliers we source raw materials and components from a significant number of suppliers around the world 
those raw materials include steel and other metals  wood  paper  paint  plastics  acoustical materials  
table of contents foam  laminates  particleboard  veneers  glass  fabrics and leather 
the prices for certain commodities such as steel  aluminum  wood  particleboard and petroleum based products have fluctuated in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our global supply chain team continually evaluates market conditions and alternate supply bases to minimize disruptions and unexpected increases in costs 
research  design and development our extensive global research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated network analysis has helped us develop unique expertise in helping people work more effectively 
we team up with external world class innovators leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe 
our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions vary from integrated architecture  furniture and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products 
design work is organizationally distributed globally across our major businesses and can involve external design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
designers then work closely with our engineers and external suppliers to co develop products and processes that lead to more efficient manufacturing while incorporating innovative user features 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we invested in research  design and development activities over the past three years 
royalties are sometimes paid to external designers of our products as the products are sold and are not included in the research  design and development costs since they are variable  based on product sales 
we continue to invest approximately one to two percent of our revenue in research and development each year 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding research  design and development costs 
intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business 
we also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks  or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such  except the steelcase  turnstone  polyvision  designtex and ideo trademarks 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our affiliates 
we also selectively license our intellectual property to third parties as a revenue source 
for example  our leap seating technology has been licensed for use in automotive and aircraft seating  and we are pursuing other licensing opportunities for this technology 
employees as of february   we had approximately  permanent employees including  hourly employees and  salaried employees 
additionally  we had  temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing 
approximately employees in the united states are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
internationally  a significant number of employees are covered by workers councils that operate to promote the interests of workers 
management believes we continue to maintain strong relations with our employees 

table of contents environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe that existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
we are a party to  or otherwise involved in  proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws  including as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  other financially viable potentially responsible parties and the total estimated cleanup costs  we do not believe that the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing towards cleanup costs

risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows  and financial condition 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents we may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy 
our growth strategy calls for expansion in existing markets by leveraging our current distribution to win new customers and more fully serve existing customers and their installed base of our products  and new adjacent markets such as the mid market segment of the office furniture market  vertical markets such as healthcare and education and emerging international markets 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to deliver to our customers a great experience  which includes innovative  well made products and world class processes 
our success relies in part on our research and development and engineering efforts  our ability to manufacture or source the products  and customer acceptance of our products 
as it relates to new markets  our success also depends on our ability to create and implement distribution strategies to reach these markets 
the potential inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
our efforts to grow our business in emerging markets include the risk factors listed below relating to our global operations  but can also include other risks 
in certain markets in asia and eastern europe where we are expanding our business  the legal and political environment can be unstable and uncertain which could make it difficult for us to compete successfully and to protect our investments or sell our investments in the future 
as we hire new people and establish new processes in these locations  we are implementing our global business standards  but there is some risk our activities could expose us to liabilities 
we also make investments in new business development initiatives which  like most startups  have a relatively high failure rate 
we limit our investments in these initiatives and establish governance procedures to contain the associated risks  but losses could result and may be material 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
we compete on a variety of factors  including brand recognition and reputation  price  lead time  delivery and service  product design and features  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers and facility managers 
in the north america segment  our top competitors in our primary markets are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc and knoll  inc 
some of our competitors have lower cost structures and a broader offering of moderately priced products  potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in certain customer segments 
in addition  such competition may prevent us from maintaining or raising the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures 
although we do not have major offshore competitors in our north america segment  there are other segments of the north america furniture industry  notably the residential furniture and made to stock office furniture segments  where lower cost imports have become dominant 
while customer lead time and customization requirements are currently inhibiting factors  it is possible we could see increased competition from imports in our core markets 
in the international segment  we tend to compete against a larger number of smaller size competitors 
most of our top competitors have strong relationships with their existing customers that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders 
these competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and can develop products that could have a competitive advantage over steelcase products 
in certain markets  we compete using an import model which requires longer lead times than local competitors with domestic supply chains 

table of contents in the other category  we are experiencing intense competition related to static and interactive whiteboard products  which has negatively impacted our operating margins during our continued success depends upon many things  including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality  high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to evolve our business model and implement world class processes to enable us to effectively compete in the office furniture industry s increasingly competitive environment 
our success is also dependent on our ability to sustain our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brand and our trademarks effectively as we enter new markets 
our efforts to restructure our industrial model may not be successful 
over the last several years  we have been migrating to a more flexible industrial model based on lean manufacturing principles and a simpler more platform based product portfolio 
we also began to adopt a global supply chain 
these strategies  along with a precipitous drop in industry demand from to  have led to the restructuring of our manufacturing operations in the north america and international segments 
the restructuring of our manufacturing operations has involved actions such as workforce reductions  facility rationalizations and the disposition of excess assets  including real estate 
the cost of these actions has had the effect of reducing earnings until expected cost savings are achieved 
while we expect to complete the final phase of our publicly announced restructuring plans during q  it is possible that additional restructuring actions will continue to be necessary  though at a less significant level  as we continue to implement our strategies 
therefore  it is also possible that the cost of our restructuring efforts will be higher than we anticipate 
the success of our restructuring initiatives is dependent on several factors  including our ability to manage facility consolidation without disrupting existing customer commitments  efficient implementation of lean manufacturing techniques  simplifying our product portfolio  establishing cost effective regional distribution centers and implementing global sourcing and supply chain initiatives 
such actions may not be accomplished as quickly and effectively as anticipated  and we may not realize the expected benefits of our restructuring activities  either of which would have a negative impact on our results of operations 
our global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have sales offices and manufacturing facilities in many countries  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our global operations may be subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture  design  develop or sell products in particular countries  which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including differing employment practices and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  and natural disasters  security concerns  including crime  political instability  terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  and global health issues 
in the united states and most countries in europe  our revenues and costs are typically in the same currency 
however there are some situations where we export and import products in different currencies 
we also may hold assets  such as equity investments  real estate investments and cash balances  or incur debt in currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business  and changes in currency controls with respect to such countries  could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  changes in tariff and import regulations and 
table of contents changes to us and international monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue 
varying tax rates or increasing limitations on net operating loss carry forwards in different jurisdictions could negatively impact our consolidated effective tax rate 
a downturn in the cyclical office furniture industry could adversely impact our revenues and profits 
office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of cyclical macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits  non residential fixed investment  white collar employment growth and commercial office construction 
our product sales are directly tied to corporate capital spending  which is outside of our control 
geopolitical uncertainties  terrorist attacks  acts of war  natural disasters  other world events or combinations of such and other factors that are outside of our control could also have a significant effect on business confidence and the global economy and therefore  our business 
the global office furniture industry experienced a significant downturn several years ago which dramatically impacted our profitability because of our historical strategy of vertical integration and the high level of fixed costs associated with our business 
while we continue to restructure our industrial model  if another economic or industry downturn occurred in a similar magnitude as experienced during recent years  we may not be able to react fast enough to counteract the decline  which could negatively impact our operating results  financial condition and access to capital 
other demand influences on our industry include technology changes  organizational change  employee health and safety concerns and the globalization of companies 
the trend towards outsourcing white collar jobs could cause our major customers in our core markets to shift employment growth to countries where our market share is not as strong 
disruptions to the supply of raw materials  component parts and labor in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our supply chain management 
we are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials and components from third party suppliers and our own manufacturing operations 
the flow of such materials and components may be affected by fluctuations in the availability and quality of the raw materials  damage and loss or disruption of production from accidents  natural disasters and other causes  and disruptions caused by labor activities 
we expect to continue to migrate to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model  which will increase our reliance on an international network of suppliers 
any disruptions in the supply and delivery of products or deficiencies in our ability to develop and manage our network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we could be adversely affected by increasing raw material costs 
we procure raw materials from a significant number of sources within the united states  canada  europe and asia 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the absolute level and volatility in steel and other commodity costs  such as energy  have significantly increased in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
these changes could also lead to supply interruptions 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs remain high or escalate further 
in the short run  rapid changes in raw material costs can be very difficult to offset because of price hold agreements we have entered into with our customers 
it is difficult to find effective hedge markets to manage these risks 
in the longer run  we may not be successful in passing along a portion of the higher raw materials costs to our customers because of competitive pressures 

table of contents disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business 
we rely largely on a network of independent and company owned dealers to market our products to customers 
our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers 
from time to time  an individual dealer or steelcase may choose to terminate the relationship  or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership 
in addition  our competitors or other third parties could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert a number of our dealers to carry their products 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty  we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership  reducing the risk of disruption  but increasing our financial exposure 
a portion of our international distribution network is owned because of the need for us to make financial investments in dealerships in order to preserve our market share in the affected regions 
if we are not able to effectively manage these dealerships  they could have a negative effect on our operating results 
in certain cases  we have adopted a direct model of distribution through which we establish company owned sales and service capabilities 
our direct sale and owned dealer models sell non steelcase products where product gaps exist 
these models involve increased operational risk  the risk of conflict with other distribution channels and the risk that we will not be able to compete effectively to win business in those markets because of a more limited breadth of product offering than a dealer who carries multiple lines of products 
we could be adversely affected by product defects 
product defects can occur within our own product development and manufacturing processes or through our increasing reliance on third parties for product development and manufacturing activities 
we incur various expenses related to product defects  including product warranty costs  product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs 
the amount of our product defect expenses relative to product sales varies from time to time and could increase in the future 
we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions  but our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve and we could need to increase our accruals for warranty charges 
in addition  the reputation of our brands may be diminished by product defects and recalls 
any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
we have significant deferred tax asset values related to net operating loss carryforwards nols in various jurisdictions 
we may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the applicable jurisdiction to fully utilize our nols 
we have nols in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk  which could reduce the amount that we will ultimately realize 
additionally  future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our nols 

table of contents our acquisition  joint venture or alliance activities may not be successful 
our growth strategy may involve acquisitions  joint ventures alliances and additional channels of distribution 
some of the risks associated with these activities are we may not identify attractive opportunities or be able to enter into transactions on acceptable terms and at the right price  we may not successfully integrate acquired entities into our operations and be able to retain key employees of the acquired companies  our business philosophy may change which could affect the business rationale for our joint ventures or alliances  and we may not successfully implement new distribution channels  and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution

the net income improvement of over was primarily driven by increased operating profits in the north america segment 
our revenue increased in compared to following an increase of from to revenue in increased for all of our reportable segments  but growth in our international segment of was the strongest 
as compared to  revenue included of incremental sales related to net acquisitions 
current year revenue was also positively impacted by from currency translation effects as compared to the prior year 
cost of sales  which is reported separately from restructuring costs  decreased to of revenue in  a percentage point improvement compared to the prior year 
improvements in the north america and international segments of and percentage points  respectively  were the key drivers of this improvement 
these improvements were partially offset by cost of sales increases at polyvision  which is included in the other category 
gross margin increased to because of the improvements in cost of sales and lower restructuring costs 

table of contents operating expenses increased in compared to the prior year 
higher variable compensation costs  intangible asset and goodwill impairment related charges at polyvision  spending related to longer term growth initiatives  currency effects and net acquisitions were the primary reasons for the increase 
operating income improved by in compared to  due to better performance in our international and north america segments and lower restructuring costs 
we recorded net pre tax operating charges for restructuring costs totaling in  compared to in and in the net charges in primarily consisted of facility rationalizations in the north america segment

equity in income of unconsolidated ventures represents our portion of the income from our joint ventures 
our consolidated results include the results of several dealers in which we either own a majority interest or we maintain participative control but our investments are structured such that we do not share in the profits or losses 
elimination of minority interest in consolidated dealers represents the elimination of earnings where either our class of equity does not share in the earnings or the earnings are allocated to the minority interest holder 
other income expense  net consists of foreign exchange gains and losses  unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments and miscellaneous income expense in  and included in this amount for is a foreign withholding tax expense from a cash dividend which was repatriated from a wholly owned foreign subsidiary and a gain on a dealer transition 
during  we recorded favorable tax adjustments of these adjustments include a reduction of deferred tax asset valuation allowances related to international and us net operating losses and us foreign tax credit carryforwards 
these reductions are the result of improved profitability and the implementation of tax planning strategies which increased the likelihood of utilizing foreign net operating losses  us state net operating losses and us foreign tax credit carryforwards 
we reduced specific tax reserves by due to the completion of a long outstanding audit of a foreign subsidiary and other 
table of contents adjustments related to open tax periods in the us in addition  we recorded a adjustment to recognize the future benefit of us foreign tax credits resulting from a change in an election for the treatment of foreign losses on our to us tax returns 
see further discussion and detail on these items in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the favorable tax adjustments had the effect of reducing the effective tax rate to 
excluding the impact of the total adjustments  the effective tax rate would have been 
in  we recorded an reduction in a specific tax reserve 
the tax reserve was originally recorded in response to a fiscal tax calculation that was later rejected by the irs 
at the time of the rejection  we recorded a reserve for the total amount of the deduction while we challenged the irs s decision 
the matter was settled in our favor during resulting in the reversal of the reserve 
we calculated our tax expense for using a rate and then adjusted it for the reserve reduction 
although our tax rate can vary from year to year  we expect that our long term effective tax rate will be within a range of to for with the us research tax credit remaining in effect through the end of the calendar year segment disclosure during the third and fourth quarters of  we made a number of changes in our organizational structure and certain key leadership positions  which resulted in changes to our segment reporting 
as a result of this change  management currently evaluates the company as eight business units steelcase group  turnstone  nurture by steelcase  international  design group  polyvision  ideo and financial services 
for external purposes  these business units are aggregated into two reportable segments north america and international  plus an other category

additionally  as compared to the prior year  current year revenue included of incremental sales related to net acquisitions and from favorable currency effects related to sales by our subsidiary in canada 
cost of sales  which is reported separately from restructuring costs  as a percent of revenue decreased percentage point from the prior year because of improved pricing yields  benefits from 
table of contents restructuring efforts and product simplicity initiatives and continued implementation of lean manufacturing principles 
the combined results from these initiatives will have allowed us to reduce our total manufacturing and distribution center footprint from approximately million square feet in to million square feet by the end of q our wood product category within the north america segment has reported significant operating losses over the past several years 
in  we estimate that this product category incurred an operating loss of after an allocation of operating expenses related to corporate and other shared service functions 
the current year results were negatively impacted by one large  complex project that was awarded in  and various long term contracts with existing customers  most of which have since been amended 
in addition  we incurred significant expenses associated with current year cost reduction initiatives  new product introductions and environmental sustainability initiatives 
as a result of our efforts  the quarterly losses in were reduced from in q to in q we expect to implement additional strategies and initiatives to further improve the profitability of our wood product category 
however  the achievement of improved operating results will depend upon the success of the strategies and initiatives discussed above  as well as various other risks and contingencies discussed in the risk factors section of this report

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity the following table summarizes our statement of cash flows year ended february  february  february  net cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents  beginning of period cash and cash equivalents  end of period during  we increased cash and cash equivalents by to a balance of as of february  of our total cash and cash equivalents  was located in the united states and the remaining was located outside of the united states  primarily in canada and europe 
these funds  in addition to cash generated from future operations and available credit facilities  are expected to be sufficient to finance our foreseeable liquidity and capital needs 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents was due to a number of factors 
operating activities generated cash primarily from net income as adjusted for depreciation and amortization  which are non cash expenses 
depreciation and amortization have remained higher than the level of capital expenditures  which represents a source of cash 
the largest investing activities were made up of capital expenditures  purchases of short term investment instruments and the acquisition of softcare innovations  inc and djrt manufacturing  inc 
softcare 
these investments were offset in part by net proceeds from asset disposals and run off collections of lease and notes receivable within financial services 
financing activities consisted primarily of quarterly dividend payments and net share repurchases 
we believe that we currently need approximately in cash to fund the day to day operating needs of our business 
our cash balances fluctuate from quarter to quarter because our business has some seasonality  and certain cash flows related to variable compensation  retirement plan funding and insurance payments occur only annually 
at this time  we expect to maintain an additional cushion of approximately for funding investments in our growth initiatives  which may include opportunistic or strategic acquisitions  and to protect us in the event of a downturn while we are still restructuring our operations 
we will also use cash to return value to shareholders  primarily through dividends and share repurchases 
these are general guidelines and our cash balance may be higher or lower at any point in time 
we also may change this approach as conditions change or new opportunities emerge 
significant uses of cash in q are expected to include approximately related to variable compensation payments and retirement plan contributions

the increase in cash generated from operating activities in was primarily due to higher net income  increased utilization of deferred income tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards and improved working capital performance 
most of the change in cash generated from operating activities from to was due to the improvements in year over year income from continuing operations and an improvement in management of working capital  primarily through an improvement in accounts receivable days sales outstanding  which was influenced by a change in terms offered to our north america dealers

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting policies that typically involve a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity are listed and explained below 
these policies were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and will be written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we made a number of changes in our organizational structure and certain key leadership positions  which resulted in changes to our segment reporting 
based on these changes  we changed our reporting units used to test goodwill for impairment 
we evaluated goodwill using the following ten reporting units where the goodwill is recorded brayton  designtex  financial services  ideo  international  metro  north america excluding consolidated dealers  north america dealers  polyvision and softcare 
during q  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units 
in the first step to test for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting 
table of contents units using a combination of two methods based upon a discounted cash flow valuation dcf and a market value approach mva 
the first method used a weighting factor based on dcf while the second valuation was based upon of dcf and of mva 
the mva was only calculated for international and north america excluding consolidated dealers because these are the two reporting units where we could obtain comparable market data 
the dcf analysis was based on the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value and used the following assumptions a business is worth today what it can generate in future cash to its owners  cash received today is worth more than an equal amount of cash received in the future  and future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
the mva used a set of four comparable companies to derive a range of market multiples for the last twelve months revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows in measuring fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment valuations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with our current internal projections and operating plans 
however  these assumptions could change over time  which may result in future impairment charges 
as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of below the underlying reported value of the goodwill as follows available enterprise value in excess of below reported goodwill discount discounted market rate cash flow value reporting unit used valuation approach brayton n a designtex n a financial services n a ideo n a international metro n a north america  excluding consolidated dealers north america dealers n a polyvision n a softcare n a the mva was not calculated for these reporting units as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
the available enterprise value for polyvision was less than reported goodwill in the first step of our impairment testing which indicated an impairment and required us to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step required us to determine the implied fair value of polyvision to compare it to the reported value 
based on this analysis  we recorded a total impairment charge of  of which related to goodwill and related to intangible assets 

table of contents for each reporting unit other than polyvision  the available enterprise value in excess of goodwill is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate by  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the excess amounts above to the following amounts available enterprise value in excess of reported goodwill using a increase in the discount rate discounted market cash flow value reporting unit valuation approach brayton n a designtex n a financial services n a ideo n a international metro n a north america  excluding consolidated dealers north america dealers n a softcare n a the mva was not calculated for these reporting units as there is no comparable market data available to make these calculations meaningful 
as of february   we had of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as follows recorded reporting unit goodwill brayton designtex financial services ideo international metro north america  excluding consolidated dealers north america dealers polyvision softcare total we also performed an impairment analysis on our other intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
our intangible assets not subject to amortization consist of trademarks within the polyvision reporting unit 
as of the valuation date  the fair value of these intangible assets was less than the recorded value 
the impairment charge was part of the total impairment charge described above 
for our intangible assets subject to amortization and our other long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  an impairment analysis is performed at least annually 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determined if the asset was recoverable 
we then compared the undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
as of the valuation date  the fair value of polyvision s intangible assets subject to amortization was less than the recorded value 
the impairment charge was part of the total impairment charge described above 

table of contents see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill  other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
these assumptions are reviewed and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including but not limited to  long term expected fund returns  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plan obligations including a sensitivity analysis 
allowances for credit losses the allowances for credit losses related to accounts receivable  notes receivable and our investments in leases is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to absorb an estimate of probable future losses existing at the balance sheet date 
in estimating probable losses  we review accounts that are past due or in bankruptcy 
we review accounts that may have higher credit risk using information available about the customer or dealer  such as financial statements  news reports and published credit ratings 
we also use general information regarding industry trends  the general economic environment and information gathered through our network of field based employees 
using an estimate of current fair market value of any applicable collateral and other credit enhancements  such as third party guarantees  we arrive at an estimated loss for specific accounts and estimate an additional amount for the remainder of the trade balance based on historical trends 
this process is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may differ from those estimates 
receivable balances are written off when we determine that the balance is uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance when received 
we consider an accounts receivable balance past due when payment has not been received within the stated terms 
we consider a note receivable past due when any installment of the note is unpaid for more than days 
see further discussion regarding concentrations of credit risk in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
future tax benefits for these carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we estimate a tax benefit from the operating loss carryforwards before valuation allowance of  but we have recorded a valuation allowance of which reduces our estimated tax benefit to additionally  we have recorded a valuation allowance of against our tax credit carryforwards which reduces our estimated tax benefit to it is considered more likely than not that a combined benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and 
table of contents other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
we cannot be assured that we will be able to realize these future tax benefits or that future valuation allowances will not be required 
a decrease in the expected amount of benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would result in a decrease in net income of approximately operating loss carryforwards tax credit february  tax effected carryforwards total carryforwards valuation allowance net benefit forward looking statements from time to time  in written and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future events and our plans and objectives for future operations 
these forward looking statements generally are accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  possible  potential  predict  project  or other similar words  phrases or expressions 
forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary from our expectations because of factors such as  but not limited to  competitive and general economic conditions domestically and internationally  acts of terrorism  war  governmental action  natural disasters and other force majeure events  changes in the legal and regulatory environment  our restructuring activities  currency fluctuations  changes in customer demand  and the other risks and contingencies detailed in this report and our other filings with the securities and exchange commission

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and fixed income and equity price risk 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and in we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that a devaluation of the us dollar against the local currencies would have increased our operating income by approximately in and in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards 
table of contents the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed and accumulated in other comprehensive income within shareholders equity until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  we could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the cumulative net foreign currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  net transaction gains were see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  notes receivable  and short term borrowings 
substantially all of our interest rates on our borrowings were fixed during  thus our interest rate risk was minimized on our debt 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are primarily invested in short dated instruments 
we estimate that a percentage point change in interest rates would have been immaterial to our results of operations for or see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
fixed income and equity price risk we are exposed to fixed income and equity price risk primarily on the cash surrender value associated with our investments in company owned life insurance 
we estimate that a adverse change in the value of the underlying funds  which could be caused by changes in interest rates  yield curve  portfolio duration or equity prices  would have reduced our operating income by approximately and in and  respectively 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain fixed income and equity investments and their results could be better or worse than the market returns 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in company owned life insurance
