our primary strategy to achieve this vision is to focus on core deposit growth with state of the art products and services and to focus lending on commercial real estate properties in the million to million size range 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  and have the greatest potential impact on the company s stated results of operations 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes that  of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed these critical accounting assumptions and estimates with the board of directors audit committee 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to operations 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the collectibility of a loan balance is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a component for individual loan impairment measured according to sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and a measure of collective loan impairment according to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained at levels deemed adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
this estimate is based upon management s evaluation of the risks in the loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of loan activity 
estimates for loan losses are derived by analyzing historical loss experience  current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  historical peer bank experience  changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
larger impaired credits that are measured according to sfas no 
have been defined to include loans which are classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention risk grades where the borrower relationship is greater than  for such loans that are considered impaired  an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan 

table of contents loans made outside the scope of sfas no 
are measured according to sfas no 
and include commercial and commercial real estate loans that are performing or have not been specifically identified under sfas no 
 and large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans evaluated based on regulatory guidelines and historical peer bank loss experience which are adjusted for qualitative factors 
income taxes provisions for income taxes are based on taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred taxes on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements  as well as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated financial statements at currently enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or settled 
in the event of changes in the tax laws  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted in the period of the enactment of those changes  with the cumulative effects included in the current year s income tax provision 
net deferred tax assets  whose realization is dependent on taxable earnings of future years  are recognized when a more likely than not criterion is met 
the company and its subsidiaries file consolidated tax returns 
acquisitions the company accounts for business combinations based on the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires us to fair value the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the fair values are based on available information and current economic conditions at the date of acquisition 
fair value may be obtained from independent appraisers  discounted cash flow present value techniques  management valuation models  quoted prices on national markets or quoted market prices from brokers 
these fair value estimates will affect future earnings through the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
such different value estimates could affect future earnings through different values being utilized for the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired

before considering the impact of reversing the valuation allowance  pretax net income for was million or per diluted share  a million or per share positive swing from the net loss in top line revenue climbed million  or  on million growth in average earning assets and a or million increase in assets under advice 
the company considers top line revenue to be useful in explaining financial performance  as it combines both the company s lending or spread income business interest income less interest expense and its fee income business  both of which often pertain to the same customer base and can be matched against the underlying noninterest expense to generate those revenue components

capital resources and liquidity management of the company has developed a strategic initiative that provides for the expansion of its banking operations into new primary service areas  as well as continued expansion of its market share in its existing market 
as of december   there were no material commitments for capital expenditures  though such expenditures may be incurred in related to utilization of additional space at the company s headquarters location in naples 
while it is anticipated that interest income will increase commensurate with interest expense upon the attraction of deposits  non interest expenses will generally be disproportionately higher until such time as the volume of deposits and interest earning assets generate net interest income and service fees sufficient to cover these costs 
management s philosophy in each instance of expansion is to attract deposit relationships through the offering of competitive rates  terms and service 
as it is the company s philosophy to consider the investment portfolio principally as a source of liquidity  deposit growth  except to the extent necessary to maintain such liquidity  is generally utilized to fund the higher yielding loan portfolio  particularly commercial and  to a lesser degree  consumer mortgage lending 
in addition  it is management s practice to maintain the company s well capitalized status in compliance with regulatory guidelines when planning its expansion activities 
consistent with the objective of operating a sound financial organization  the company maintains high capital ratios 
regulatory agencies including the state of florida department of financial services  the fdic and the federal reserve system have approved guidelines for a risk based capital framework that makes capital requirements more sensitive to the risks germane to each individual institution 
the guidelines require that total capital of be held against total risk adjusted assets 
at december   the company s tier risk based capital ratio was  total risk based capital ratio was  and the tier leverage ratio was 
the company s ability to satisfy demands for credit  deposit withdrawals and other corporate needs depends on its level of liquidity 
the company utilizes several means to manage its liquidity 
one of the tools that the company uses to measure liquidity is a comparison of total liquid assets cash  due from banks  federal funds sold  
table of contents and other investments to total deposits  calculating it on a daily basis and reviewing it monthly with the subsidiary bank management and board of director asset liability management committees alco 
as of december   consolidated company liquid assets were million or of consolidated deposits 
it is the policy of the banks to manage the latter ratio between and 
traditionally  increases in deposits are sufficient to provide adequate levels of liquidity  however  if needed  the company has approved extensions of credit available from correspondent banks amounting to million  sources for loan sales  and primarily short term investments that could be liquidated if necessary 
in addition  the company s banking subsidiaries are members of the federal home loan bank and  subject to certain collateral verification requirements  bank of florida southwest  bank of florida southeast and bank of florida tampa bay may borrow up to  and  respectively  of their outstanding assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the companys market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in its lending and deposit gathering activities 
the measure of market risk associated with financial instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting on and off balance sheet transactions are aggregated  and the resulting net positions are identified 
the company does not currently engage in trading or hedging activities and has not invested in interest rate derivatives or entered into interest rate swaps 
however  in support of its asset liability management process the company may implement derivatives hedging strategies in the future with the intent of reducing interest rate risk 
bank of florida corporation s primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on the company s net interest income and capital  while adjusting its asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure 
disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which reflects changes in market prices and rates  can be found in note fair values of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
asset liability management it is the objective of the company to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
certain of the officers of the banks are responsible for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix  stability and leverage of all sources of funds while adhering to prudent banking practices 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth primarily through growth of core deposits  which include deposits of all categories made by individuals  partnerships and corporations 
management of the company seeks to invest the largest portion of its assets in commercial  consumer and real estate loans 
the asset liability mix is monitored on a monthly basis and a monthly report reflecting interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to the respective banks boards of directors 
the objective of this policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on the banks earnings 
interest sensitivity the objective of interest sensitivity management is to minimize the risk associated with the effect of interest rate changes on net interest margins while maintaining net interest income at acceptable levels 
managing this risk involves monthly monitoring of the interest sensitive assets relative to interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
all assets and liabilities are evaluated as maturing at the earlier of re pricing date or contractual maturity date 
while liabilities without specific terms such as money market  now and savings accounts are generally considered core deposits for liquidity purposes  are deemed to re price for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis within the first twelve months 
management subjectively sets rates on all accounts 
the principal measure of our exposure to interest rate risk is the difference between interest sensitive assets and liabilities for the periods being measured  commonly referred to as gap for such period 
a positive gap position represents a greater amount of interest sensitive assets re pricing or maturing 
thus  an increase in rates would positively impact net interest income  as the yield on interest earning assets would increase prior to the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
conversely  a negative gap position is indicative of a bank that has a greater amount of interest sensitive liabilities re pricing or maturing than it does interest sensitive assets  in a 
table of contents given time interval 
in this instance  the impact on net interest income would be positive in a declining rate environment and negative if rates were rising 
the impact on net interest income described above is general  as other factors would additionally maximize or minimize the effect 
for example  a change in the prime interest rate could effect an immediate change to rates on prime related assets  whereas a liability which re prices according to changes in treasury rates might lag in the timing of the change and change rates in an amount less than the change in the prime interest rate 
it is common to focus on the one year gap  which is the difference between the dollar amount of assets and the dollar amount of liabilities maturing or repricing within the next twelve months 
the following is a consolidated maturity and re pricing analysis of rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  in thousands 
days days years over years total interest earning assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits investment securities restricted securities loans total interest earning assets interest bearing demand deposits savings certificates of deposit other borrowings total interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap rate sensitive assets less rate sensitive liabilities interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap ratio as a percent of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap ratio as a percent of total assets at december   the company had million in interest sensitive assets compared to million in interest sensitive liabilities that will mature or re price within a year  resulting in a positive gap position of million or  expressed as a percentage of total assets 
management believes that the current balance sheet structure of interest sensitive assets and liabilities does not represent a material risk to earnings or liquidity in the event of a change in market rates
