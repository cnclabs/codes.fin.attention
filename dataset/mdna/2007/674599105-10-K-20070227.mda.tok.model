item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a incorporating item a in this report  the term occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation opc and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental s business is divided into two segments conducted through oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates oxychem 
strategy general occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategy focus on large  long lived oil and gas assets with long term growth potential  maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet  and manage the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures 
occidental prefers to own large  long lived legacy oil and gas assets  like those in california and the permian basin  that tend to have moderate decline rates  enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production 
management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital 
at occidental  maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle 
during periods of high commodity prices  occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures and dividends to improve the potential for future earnings by making such investments 
the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy 
capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way  to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to lower manufacturing costs 
asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and pvc businesses 
historically  the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements 
occidental intends to invest this cash mainly in strategically attractive assets

the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry 
the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around occidental s core areas  which are the united states  the middle east north africa and latin america  pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir management practices  and maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
over the past several years  occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas 
occidental has invested in  and disposed of  assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets 
see oil and gas segment business review for a discussion of these changes 
in addition  occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the dolphin project in qatar and the uae and in libya  and assumed operations in the mukhaizna field in oman for future growth opportunities  not for current production 
in  occidental acquired vintage petroleum  inc vintage which it expects to provide growth in production  primarily from the vintage argentina assets 
occidental s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields  beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california  followed by a series of purchases in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico and the integration of the vintage and plains exploration and production company plains operations acquired in at the end of  the elk hills and permian assets made up percent of occidental s consolidated proven oil reserves and percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves 
on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis  they accounted for percent of occidental s consolidated reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  boe per day

oxychem s strategy is to be a low cost producer so that it can maximize its cash flow generation 
oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine  which is coproduced with caustic soda  and then chlorine and ethylene are converted  through a series of intermediate products  into polyvinyl chloride pvc 
oxychem s focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale 
key performance indicators general occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in total return to stockholders  return on equity  return on capital employed  and other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced  cost to produce each unit  cash flow per unit  cost to find and develop new reserves  reserve replacement percentage and other similar measures 
debt structure occidental s total debt and total debt to capitalization ratios are shown in the table below date amounts in millions total debt a total debt to capitalization ratio a includes trust preferred securities redeemed january   natural gas delivery commitment terminated in  subsidiary preferred stock and capital lease obligations 
as shown  occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio declined to percent from the percent level that existed at the end of the decrease in the total debt to capitalization ratio in compared with resulted from total debt reductions of percent combined with an increase in stockholders equity of percent over the same period 
since the second quarter of  occidental s long term senior unsecured debt has been rated a by standard and poor s corporation  a by moody s investors service  a by fitch ratings and a low by dominion bond rating service 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
return on equity annual a three year average b a the return on equity for was calculated by dividing occidental s earnings applicable to common stock by the average equity balance in b the three year average return on equity was calculated by dividing the average earnings applicable to common stock over the three year period by the average equity balance over the same period 
occidental has focused on achieving top quartile return on equity 
in  occidental s return on equity was percent and the three year average return on equity was percent 
during the same three year period  occidental increased its stockholders equity by percent and its quarterly dividend by percent while its stock price increased by percent 
oil and gas segment business environment oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short and intermediate term financial performance 
average yearly oil prices strengthened in over levels but ended the year even with year end levels 
during the year  occidental experienced an increase in its price differential between the average west texas intermediate wti price and occidental s realized prices 
occidental s realized price as a percentage of wti was approximately percent and percent for and  respectively 
prices and differentials can vary significantly  even on a short term basis  making it difficult to forecast realized prices

acquisitions in january  occidental completed the merger of vintage into a wholly owned occidental subsidiary 
as a result  occidental acquired assets in argentina  california  yemen  bolivia and the permian basin in texas 
see the applicable sections below for further information 
occidental paid billion in cash to former vintage shareholders  issued approximately million shares of occidental common stock  which were valued at billion  and assumed vintage s debt  which had an estimated fair value of million at closing 
during  occidental divested a portion of vintage s assets for consideration of approximately billion 
in september  occidental acquired oil and gas assets from plains for million 
the principal properties acquired are adjacent to occidental s existing operations in california and the permian basin in west texas 
occidental s production from the vintage acquisition averaged  boe per day in during the fourth quarter of  production from the plains assets averaged  boe per day 
elk hills occidental operates the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california s san joaquin valley with an approximate percent interest 
the field was acquired in for billion and is the largest producer of gas in california 
in  occidental made additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing properties near the field for approximately million 
most of these properties were obtained as part of the acquisition from plains discussed above 
oil and gas production in from these properties and the field was approximately  boe per day 
during  occidental performed infill drilling  field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques resulting in new wells being drilled and wells being worked over 
in addition  an air separation unit was installed to enhance oil recovery with nitrogen injection 
as a result of these activities and acquisitions  occidental was able to maintain production at levels 
since its acquisition  total elk hills oil and gas production has been approximately million boe 
at the end of  the property had an estimated million boe of proved reserves  compared to the million boe that were recorded at the time of the acquisition 
permian basin the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states  with the entire basin accounting for approximately percent of the total united states oil production 
occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with an approximate percent net share of the total permian basin oil production 
occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl in the permian basin 
most of occidental s permian basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of altura in for approximately billion 
in and  occidental made several additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests for approximately billion and million including approximately million related to the acquisition of vintage and the property acquisitions from plains  respectively 
occidental s total share of permian basin oil  gas and ngl production averaged  boe per day in compared to  boe per day in at the end of  occidental s permian basin properties had billion boe in proved reserves 
occidental s permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas 
the largest producing areas in included wasson san andres  slaughter  levelland  north cowden  wasson clearfork and salt creek  which contributed percent  percent  percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively  to occidental s permian boe production 
occidental s interests in the permian basin offer additional development and exploitation potential 
during  occidental drilled approximately wells on its operated properties and participated in wells drilled on outside operated interests 
occidental conducted significant development activity on eight carbon dioxide co projects during  including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing co floods 
occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells 
occidental had an average of well service units working in the permian area during performing well maintenance and workovers 
approximately percent of occidental s permian basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery eor technique 
this involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent  causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells 
these co flood operations make occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 
vintage california in  occidental combined its california properties acquired from vintage and plains with existing california properties excluding the elk hills  thums and tidelands oil production company tidelands properties 
the combined properties produce oil and gas from more than fields  spread over miles mainly in the ventura  san joaquin and sacramento basins 
oil and gas average production in was approximately  boe per day 
at the end of  the combined properties had an estimated million boe of proved reserves 
thums occidental purchased thums  the field contractor for an oil production unit offshore long beach  california  in since then  occidental has implemented a successful development plan 
occidental s share of production from thums is subject to contractual arrangements similar to a production sharing contract psc  whereby occidental s share of production varies inversely with oil prices

middle east north africa dolphin project occidental s investment in the dolphin project  which was acquired in  consists of two separate economic interests held through two separate legal entities 
one entity  oxy dolphin e p  llc  owns a percent undivided interest in the assets and liabilities associated with a development and production sharing agreement dpsa with the government of qatar to develop and produce natural gas and condensate in qatar s north field for years from the start of production  with a provision to request a year extension 
the purchase price of the undivided working interest in the dpsa was approximately million and was recorded in property  plant equipment pp e 
this undivided interest is proportionately consolidated in occidental s financial statements 
a second entity  oxy dolphin pipeline  llc  owns percent of the stock of dolphin energy limited dolphin energy 
the purchase price of dolphin energy stock totaled approximately million and was recorded as an equity investment 
dolphin energy is the operator under the dpsa on behalf of the three dpsa participants  including occidental 
dolphin energy also has the rights to build  own and operate a mile long  inch natural gas pipeline  which will transport dry natural gas from qatar to the uae 
the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately billion in total  including investments in the local uae eastern gas distribution system and the al ain fujairah pipelines  which were added to improve the natural gas distribution system but were not contained in the original scope of the dolphin project 
occidental expects to invest approximately billion of this total 
the project is being financed by a combination of participant investment and project financing 
during  occidental expects to spend a combined total of approximately million for the gas exploration and development activity and the investment in dolphin energy  compared to million in in  the government of qatar approved the final field development plan for the dolphin project 
construction of an onshore gas processing and compression plant at ras laffan in qatar commenced in and is continuing 
the pipeline is projected to start up with temporary third party gas volumes in the first quarter of the gas volumes produced under the dolphin dpsa are expected to replace the temporary third party gas commencing with the start up of the onshore gas plant in mid based on existing supply contracts  the dolphin project is expected to export approximately billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas per day plus associated liquids and byproducts 
however  the pipeline is expected to have capacity to transport up to bcf of natural gas per day 
demand for natural gas in the uae and oman continues to grow and dolphin energy s customers have requested additional gas supplies 
to help fulfill this growing demand  dolphin energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from qatar 
to date  occidental has recorded million boe of proved oil and gas reserves for the dolphin project dpsa activity 
proved developed  non producing oil and gas reserves are million boe  with the rest included in proved undeveloped reserves 
no revenue or production costs were recorded in for the dolphin project gas exploration and development activity 
qatar in addition to the dolphin project  occidental participates in two production projects in qatar idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd 
occidental continues to target the development and recovery of additional reserves in both the isnd and issd fields by applying advanced drilling systems and improved reservoir management techniques 
capital expenditures in qatar for the issd and isnd projects were million in occidental s net share of combined production from the two fields averaged  barrels per day in yemen occidental owns interests in four blocks in yemen  including a percent direct working interest in the masila fields  a percent interest in the east shabwa field  comprising a percent direct working interest and an percent equity interest in an unconsolidated entity  and a percent interest in block s  which was part of the vintage acquisition 
average production was  barrels of oil per day in  with  coming from masila   from east shabwa and the remainder from block s in addition  occidental owns and operates an percent working interest in block and is finalizing the psc for block  which was acquired in an exploration bid round 
oman occidental s oman business includes block and block  where it holds a percent working interest in each  block  where it holds a percent working interest and block  where it holds a percent working interest 
occidental is the operator of all four blocks where production averaged  boe per day in  with  boe coming from block   boe from block and the remainder from block the block agreement provides for two ten year extensions and occidental has agreed with the government of oman to the first ten year extension through december  occidental and its block partners signed a new psc for the mukhaizna field with the government of oman in in september  occidental assumed operations of the mukhaizna field  where it holds a percent working interest 
the mukhaizna field  located in oman s south central interior  was discovered in and was brought into production in primary production peaked in the same year at  barrels of oil per day and by september  had declined to  barrels of oil per day 
by the end of  occidental had increased gross production to  barrels of oil per day 
occidental plans to use horizontal well steamflood technology to steadily increase production 
in october  occidental received approval for development of the khamilah field in block the exploitation term of the agreement is years beginning in september occidental began production in june  well ahead of the planned start up timing of october occidental and its block partners signed a new psc for block with the government of oman in june the initial exploration phase is four years beginning in july in march  occidental began selling gas from block to the government of oman under a gas sales agreement 
under the agreement  occidental and its block partner must supply approximately mmcf per day of natural gas until december  occidental s minimum delivery obligation is approximately percent of the expected average gross production 
in  occidental and its partner supplied an average of approximately mmcf per day of natural gas under the agreement 
as of december   the gross proved gas reserves from block comprise approximately percent of the minimum gas still to be delivered under the agreement 
libya occidental suspended all activities in libya in as a result of economic sanctions imposed by the united states government 
during the imposition of sanctions  occidental derived no economic benefit from its libyan interests 
in  the united states government lifted all of the principal economic sanctions against libya 
in  the united states effectively eliminated the last of the economic sanctions 
in  the libyan authorities approved the terms of occidental s participation in the assets that it left in this re entry agreement allowed occidental to return to its libyan operations on generally the same terms in effect when activities were suspended 
those assets consist of three producing contracts in the sirte basin and four exploration blocks 
occidental paid approximately million in re entry bonuses  capital adjustment and work in progress payments and is required to pay million per year while it continues to operate in libya  as reimbursements for past development costs associated with these assets 
in addition  occidental committed to spend million over the next five years in the four exploration blocks 
currently  occidental s rights in the producing fields extend through and early occidental had its first lifting from its libyan operations in september and production during averaged  boe per day 
separately  in early  occidental participated in the epsa iv exploration bid round in libya 
occidental successfully bid on nine of the areas available 
occidental is the operator for five onshore areas and has a percent exploration working interest in each area 
in addition  occidental holds a percent exploration working interest in four offshore areas 
woodside petroleum ltd 
is the operator for the offshore areas 
occidental paid approximately million in exploration lease bonuses for these nine new areas and committed to perform a minimum exploration work program valued at million over the commitment period 
in  approximately  kilometers of seismic data was acquired for the onshore areas which will provide the basis for analysis and selection of the initial exploration prospects to be drilled by occidental 
onshore seismic acquisition and analysis activity is planned to continue into in the offshore areas  the operator acquired approximately  kilometers of seismic data in preparation for the planned drilling program 
in november  occidental commenced drilling of the first exploration well in the onshore program  which is undergoing evaluation 
a second rig is expected to begin drilling in the first quarter of and a substantial portion of the exploration drilling obligations is expected to be completed during the next month period 
other eastern hemisphere pakistan occidental holds oil and gas working interests  that vary from to percent  in four badin blocks in pakistan 
bp is the operator 
occidental s share of production was approximately  boe per day in russia in january  occidental sold its percent interest in the vanyoganneft joint venture to tnk bp for approximately million 
at year end  occidental s proved vanyoganneft reserves were an estimated million boe and its production was approximately  boe per day in occidental recorded a gain of approximately million resulting from the sale in the first quarter of latin america argentina substantially all of occidental s argentina assets were obtained as part of the acquisition of vintage in the assets consist of concessions  of which occidental operates with a percent working interest  located in the san jorge basin in southern argentina and the cuyo basin and neuqu n basin in western argentina 
during  occidental drilled new wells and performed a number of recompletions and well repairs 
occidental expects to significantly increase production over the next five years through aggressive drilling  waterflooding and eor projects 
occidental is planning to drill wells and implement a number of waterflood projects in occidental s share of production from argentina averaged  boe per day in bolivia in  occidental s operating subsidiary acquired working interests in four blocks located in the tarija  chuquisaca and santa cruz regions of bolivia as part of the vintage acquisition 
production for was approximately  boe per day 
in  bolivia initiated a nationalization process pursuant to which occidental s operating subsidiary entered into two new operations contracts with commercial terms that  among other things  provide bolivia greater operational control and control over the commercialization of hydrocarbons 
colombia occidental is the operator of the ca o lim n field where its share of production averaged  barrels of oil per day in colombia s national oil company  ecopetrol  operates the ca o lim n cove as oil pipeline and marine export terminal 
the pipeline transports oil produced from the ca o lim n field for export to international markets 
in  ecopetrol approved development of the caricare field  an exploration discovery under the rondon association contract  adjacent to ca o lim n 
production from this field  where occidental holds a percent working interest  commenced in may production from the field and two adjacent fields was  boe per day in in  occidental signed a new agreement with ecopetrol for an eor project in the la cira infantas field  located in central colombia 
in december  occidental completed the second pilot phase and agreed with ecopetrol to enter into a third and commercial phase of the project 
in  occidental s share of production was  boe per day 
production from la cira infantas is transported by the ecopetrol pipeline and sold to an ecopetrol refinery 
additionally  occidental holds various working interests in eight exploration blocks 
ecuador in may  ecuador terminated occidental s contract for the operation of block  which comprised all of its oil producing operations in the country  and seized occidental s block assets 
the process resulting in this action began shortly after occidental prevailed  by unanimous decision of an international arbitration panel subsequently upheld by a london court  in a legal dispute over tax refunds that ecuador wrongfully withheld 
occidental immediately filed an arbitration claim against ecuador  seeking redress for illegal confiscation of the block operations with the international centre for settlement of investment disputes in washington  dc  invoking the protections of the us ecuador bilateral investment treaty 
as a result of the seizure  occidental classified its block operations as discontinued operations 
in  occidental recorded a net after tax charge of million in discontinued operations 
this amount consists of after tax charges for the write off of the investment in block in ecuador  as well as ship or pay obligations entered into with respect to the oleoducto de crudos pesados  ltd 
ocp pipeline in ecuador to ship oil produced in block  partially offset by million after tax income from operations for the first five months of occidental s block assets and liabilities are classified as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheets on a retrospective basis 
in addition  occidental has a percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline 
see also off balance sheet arrangements ecuador for further information about the ocp pipeline 
production sharing contracts occidental conducts its operations in qatar  oman and yemen under pscs and  under such contracts  receives a share of production to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
in addition  occidental s share of production from thums and tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc 
occidental s share of production from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
proved reserves evaluation and review process a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data 
in addition  a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee has been established  consisting of senior corporate officers  to monitor and review occidental s oil and gas reserves 
the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental s board of directors periodically throughout the year 
occidental has retained ryder scott company  lp ryder scott  independent petroleum engineering consultants  to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since again in  ryder scott has compared occidental s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data  methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes  the economic evaluations and reserves classifications 
ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental s total reserves portfolio 
in  ryder scott reviewed percent of occidental s oil and gas reserves 
since being engaged in  ryder scott has reviewed occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately percent of occidental s oil and gas reserves 
based on this review  including the data  technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental  ryder scott has concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards 
ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by occidental 
proved reserve additions occidental consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end of  million boe  as compared with the year end amount of  million boe 
additionally  occidental s investments in other interests had proved reserves of million and million boe at year end and  respectively 
the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was million boe  of which million boe were from proved developed reserves and million boe were from proved undeveloped reserves 
proved developed reserves represent approximately percent of occidental s total proved reserves at year end compared to percent at year end proved reserve additions consolidated subsidiaries in millions of boe proved developed proved undeveloped proved total revisions of previous estimates improved recovery extensions and discoveries purchases total additions proved reserves consist of percent crude oil and condensate and percent natural gas 
revisions of previous estimates in  occidental added net reserves of million boe through revisions of previous estimates  primarily in libya  the dolphin project and argentina  partially offset by negative revisions in the united states reflecting a reduction in gas prices 
oil price changes would affect proved reserves recorded by occidental 
for example  if oil prices increased by per barrel  less oil volume is required to recover costs  and pscs would reduce occidental s share of proved reserves by approximately million boe 
conversely  if oil prices dropped by per barrel  occidental s share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount 
oil price changes would also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts  in a manner partially offsetting the psc reserve volume changes 
apart from the effects of product prices  occidental s approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 
improved recovery in  occidental added reserves of million boe through improved recovery 
in the united states  improved recovery additions were million boe in the permian basin and million boe in the elk hills field 
foreign additions included million boe in argentina and million boe in colombia 
the elk hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques 
in the permian basin  the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques  such as drilling additional co flood and water flood wells 
extensions and discoveries occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries  which are dependent on successful exploitation programs 
in  as a result of such programs  occidental added reserves of million boe  consisting of million boe in the united states  million boe in the middle east north africa and million boe in argentina 
in western colorado  occidental added approximately million boe from the extension of gas reserves  most of which will require additional development capital 
the success of improved recovery  extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements  as well as oil and gas prices  capital costs and operating costs 
many of these factors are outside of management s control  and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 
purchases of proved reserves in  occidental purchased reserves of million boe  of which million boe were in the united states and million boe were in latin america 
the vintage acquisition added proved reserves of million boe in argentina and million boe in bolivia with the remainder in the united states and yemen  of which percent were proved developed reserves 
occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at reasonable prices 
acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms 
as market conditions change  the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 
proved undeveloped reserves occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of million boe resulting from improved recovery  extensions and discoveries and purchases  primarily in argentina  the permian basin and the elk hills field 
argentina provided percent of this increase 
these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers of million boe to the proved developed category as a result of development programs 
the dolphin project transferred million boe to the proved developed category during this transfer  along with other revisions  reduced the dolphin project s proved undeveloped reserves to million boe at december  from million boe at december  overall  occidental s proved undeveloped reserves decreased by million boe in industry outlook the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
worldwide oil prices in remained at or near historical highs during the first three quarters of the year  but fell in the fourth quarter 
continued economic growth  resulting in increased demand  and concerns about supply availability  could result in continued high prices 
a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 
oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the wti price has averaged approximately per barrel over the past ten years 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices 
during  occidental experienced an increase in its price differential of the average wti price over occidental s realized prices 
see the oil and gas segment business environment section above for further information 
while local supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence 
over the last ten years  the nymex gas price has averaged approximately per mcf 
chemical segment business environment the chemical segment results improved in due to better margins despite higher feedstock costs 
oxychem also benefited from the mid year acquisition of two basic chemical manufacturing facilities from vulcan materials company vulcan and realized substantial synergies and higher sales volumes 
business review basic chemicals during  demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong while energy costs fell  which enabled oxychem to realize above average margins 
oxychem s chlor alkali operating rate for was percent  just slightly above the industry average operating rate of percent 
industry demand for liquid caustic soda in was virtually flat compared to the prior year 
demand increased in the refining industry but was offset by reduced demand primarily in the organics and inorganics chemical market segments 
industry pricing for caustic soda started the year strong  but subsequently softened throughout the first three quarters of caustic soda supply tightened in the fourth quarter due to lower chlorine demand resulting from a weakening vinyls sector and lower imports of caustic soda 
this led to caustic soda price stabilization in the fourth quarter 
vinyls the pvc industry realized record level pricing and margins for ethylene cost increases of percent were partially offset by lower natural gas prices 
total pvc industry wide demand in was percent lower as compared with oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of percent for  compared to the north american industry average of percent 
industry outlook in  occidental s chemical business core earnings increased by percent compared to  primarily due to the continued strong united states economy  higher sales volumes  largely due to the full year impact of the vulcan operating assets  and improving margins 
future performance will depend on global economic activity  the competitiveness of the united states in the world economy  feedstock and energy pricing  and the impact of additional production capacity entering the market place 
basic chemicals forecasts of a slowing economy offset by a stabilizing residential construction market in are expected to result in demand levels similar to average levels 
despite first quarter pressure on pricing from a weak vinyls market  margins in are expected to remain strong  but could weaken in the fourth quarter due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in late vinyls industry wide pvc operating rates are expected to be lower in as a result of weak demand in the first quarter coupled with the start up of new capacity later in the year 
lower cost far east asian pvc production has resulted in a significant increase in imports of pvc and finished goods into the western hemisphere 
corporate and other corporate and other includes the investments in lyondell chemical company lyondell and premcor  inc  premcor  a leased cogeneration facility in taft  louisiana and a  mile oil pipeline and gathering system located in the permian basin  which is used in corporate directed oil and gas marketing and trading operations 
it also includes a cogeneration facility at ingleside  texas  in which occidental held a percent interest  and acquired the remaining percent interest in october the premcor investment was sold in since december   occidental has resolved certain legal disputes that it expects will result in a gain of approximately million in the first quarter of on august   occidental effected a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend to shareholders of record as of that date with distribution of the shares on august  all share and per share amounts discussed and disclosed in this annual report on form k reflect the effect of the stock split

consolidated analysis of financial position the changes in the following components of occidental s balance sheet are discussed below selected balance sheet components in millions current assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments trade receivables  net receivables from joint ventures  partnerships and other inventories prepaid expenses and other assets of discontinued operations total current assets long term receivables  net investments in unconsolidated entities property  plant and equipment  net current liabilities current maturities of long term debt and capital lease liabilities accounts payable accrued liabilities dividends payable domestic and foreign income taxes liabilities of discontinued operations total current liabilities long term debt  net deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes deferred credits and other liabilities other long term liabilities of discontinued operations stockholders equity assets see cash flow analysis for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents 
the increase in trade receivables is due to higher worldwide oil prices and higher oil and gas production volumes during the fourth quarter of versus the increase in inventories is due to an increase in materials and supplies  mainly in oman and colombia  and increases in chemical inventory volumes during the fourth quarter of versus the decrease in assets of discontinued operations is due to the write off of the investment in block in ecuador during the second quarter of the decrease in long term receivables reflects lower mark to market adjustments on long term derivative financial instruments 
the increase in investments in unconsolidated entities is due to mark to market adjustments on the lyondell investment  which became an available for sale investment in may and additional capital investments made on the dolphin project during  partially offset by the sale of million shares of lyondell common stock

a this ratio is computed by dividing year end total debt  as shown in the md a strategy key performance indicators debt structure  by the sum of year end total debt plus year end stockholders equity 
the increase in current maturities of long term debt and capital leases is due to the percent medium term notes  which were reclassified from long term to current since they mature in the increase in accounts payable is due to the vintage acquisition  higher prices and volumes for purchased oil in the marketing and trading operations  and higher chemical volume and feedstock price increases during the decrease in long term debt  net is due to various debt redemptions and repurchases throughout  offset by the debt assumed in the vintage acquisition 
the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes is due to the additional deferred taxes recorded as part of the vintage acquisition purchase accounting 
the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities other is due to additional pension liabilities recorded in connection with occidental s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas the increase in long term liabilities of discontinued operations was due to accruing the ocp ship or pay obligations in ecuador 
the increase in stockholders equity reflects the stock issued as consideration for the vintage acquisition and net income for  partially offset by treasury stock repurchases and dividend payments 
liquidity and capital resources at december   occidental had approximately billion in cash and short term investments on hand 
although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production  occidental believes that cash and short term investments on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs  capital expenditure requirements  dividend payments  potential acquisitions  its announced common stock repurchase program and debt repurchases 
if needed  occidental could access its existing credit facilities 
available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately billion at december  in september  occidental amended and restated its billion bank credit credit facility to  among other things  lower the interest rate and extend the term to september the credit facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if occidental files for bankruptcy 
occidental had not drawn down any amounts on the credit facility at december  none of occidental s committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidental s ability to borrow under these lines 
occidental s credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 
at december   under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements  occidental s capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately billion  and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on  and for acquisitions of  occidental s capital stock was approximately billion  assuming that such dividends  distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing 
in january  occidental completed the vintage acquisition and paid billion in cash to former vintage shareholders and issued approximately million shares of occidental common stock  which were valued at billion 
in addition  occidental assumed vintage s debt  which had an estimated fair market value of million at closing

the proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the dolphin project 
the new bridge loan has a term of four years  is a revolving credit facility for the first two years and may be converted to a term loan thereafter 
in september  dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a billion islamic law compliant facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the dolphin project 
this four year financing facility is structured as a transaction in which dolphin energy constructs part of the midstream portion of the dolphin project on behalf of a group of islamic investors and enters into a lease to use such assets upon construction completion 
occidental guarantees percent of both of these obligations of dolphin energy 
at december   occidental s portion of the bridge loan and islamic law compliant facility draw downs were million and million  respectively 
occidental had recorded million on the balance sheet at december   for the combined bridge loan and islamic law compliant facility 
the remaining amounts of the bridge loan and islamic law compliant facility draw downs are included in guarantees discussed in off balance sheet arrangements guarantees below 
in the first quarter of  occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of various securities

in january  occidental completed a cash tender offer for its percent senior debentures due  percent senior debentures due  percent senior notes due  percent senior debentures due and percent senior notes due  resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling million 
the repurchases were funded with occidental s cash on hand and resulted in debt repurchase expenses of million 
cash flow analysis in millions net cash provided by operating activities the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from several factors 
the most important drivers were higher crude oil prices  higher oil and gas production and  to a much lesser extent  higher chemical margins  partially offset by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations 
in  occidental s realized crude oil prices increased by percent and its oil and gas production increased by over percent compared to the increase in production was mainly due to the months of production from the vintage acquisition 
increases in the costs of producing oil and gas  such as purchased goods and services  and higher utility costs  gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes  partially offset the effect of oil price increases 
other cost elements  such as labor costs and overheads  are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 
the cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production 
most major chemical prices increased in  compared to  at a higher rate than ethylene costs  thereby improving chemical margins 
the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment 
sales volumes for certain chemical products were slightly lower in  however  this did not have a significant effect on occidental s earnings and cash flow 
the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from several factors 
the most important drivers were the significantly higher oil and natural gas prices and  to a much lesser extent  chemical prices 
although the changes in realized prices varied among the regions in which occidental operates  in  occidental s realized oil prices were higher overall by percent 
occidental s realized natural gas price increased over percent in the united states  where approximately percent of occidental s natural gas was produced in increases in the costs of producing oil and gas  such as purchased goods and services  and higher utility  gas plant and production taxes  partially offset oil and gas sales price increases  but such cost increases had a much lower effect on cash flow than the realized price increases 
other cost elements  such as labor costs and overheads  are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 
most major chemical prices increased in at a higher rate than the energy driven increase in feedstock and power costs  thereby improving profits and cash flow 
the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes  not only because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment  but also because of increases in energy price driven feedstock and electric power costs  which are major elements of manufacturing cost for the chemical segment s products 
sales volumes for chemical products generally were higher in  but this did not have a significant effect on occidental s earnings and cash flow 
other non cash charges to income in included stock incentive plan amortization  deferred compensation and environmental remediation accruals 
other non cash charges to income in included chemical asset write downs  deferred compensation  stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals

commitments at december   for major capital expenditures during and thereafter were approximately million 
occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in the course of its business activities  occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives 
the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed 
occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities 
these transactions  or groups of transactions  are recorded in compliance with gaap and  unless otherwise noted  are not reflected on occidental s balance sheets 
the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 
dolphin project see oil and gas segment business review middle east north africa dolphin project and liquidity and capital resources for further information 
ecuador in ecuador  occidental has a percent interest in the ocp oil export pipeline 
as of december   occidental s net investment in and advances to the project totaled million 
occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting 
the project was funded in part by senior project debt 
the senior project debt is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador 
in may  ecuador terminated occidental s contract for the operation of block  which comprised all of its oil producing operations in the country  and seized occidental s block assets 
occidental s guarantee of its share of the ship or pay obligations provides the lenders the right to require occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation 
at december   the total pre tax advance tariff payment of approximately million was accrued in occidental s consolidated financial statements  and was included in the net after tax charge of million discussed in the business review latin america ecuador section 
this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt 
at december   occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling million 
leases occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements  mainly for railcars  power plants  manufacturing facilities and office space 
occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility 
lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales 
see the contractual obligations table below 
guarantees occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds  letters of credit  indemnities  commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties  mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees

b includes accounts payable  certain accrued liabilities and obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans 
c amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income 
d includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business 
some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations 
due to their long term nature  purchase contracts with terms greater than years are discounted using a percent discount rate 
e amounts exclude purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and similar federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  however  occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including environmental proceedings  occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
since  occidental chemical corporation occ has been served with ten lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately  individual plaintiffs 
these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide 
occ is aware of  but has not been served in  additional cases in nicaragua  which occidental understands make similar allegations 
in the opinion of management  the claims against occ are without merit because  among other things  occ believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in nicaragua 
under the applicable nicaraguan statute  defendants are required to pay pre trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense 
occ filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre trial deposit 
in  the judge in one of the cases osorio case  ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants  including occ  and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre trial deposit 
in order to preserve its jurisdictional defense  occ elected not to make a substantive appearance in the osorio case 
in  the judge in the osorio case entered judgment against several defendants  including occ  for damages totaling approximately million 
in december  the court in a second case in nicaragua rios case entered a judgment against several defendants  including occ  for damages totaling approximately million 
while preserving its jurisdictional defenses  occ has appealed the judgments in the osorio and rios cases 
occ has no assets in nicaragua and  in the opinion of management  any judgment rendered under the statute  including in the osorio and rios cases  would be unenforceable in the united states 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal  state  local and foreign tax jurisdictions 
taxable years prior to are generally closed for us federal corporate income tax purposes 
corporate tax returns for taxable years through are in various stages of audit by the us internal revenue service 
disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 
occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity  drilling services  electrical power  steam and certain chemical raw materials 
at december   the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements  which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers  aggregated million  which was payable as follows in millions and fixed payments under these agreements were million in  million in and million in see off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations for further information 
occidental has certain other commitments under contracts  guarantees and joint ventures  including purchase commitments for goods and services at market related prices and certain other contingent liabilities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for further information 
some of these commitments  although not fixed or determinable  involve capital expenditures and are part of the to billion in capital expenditures estimated for occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental 
these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds 
as of december   occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities 
if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental s reserves  an outcome not currently anticipated  it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  after taking into account reserves  management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of substances to the environment 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries are currently participating in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at federal superfund sites  comparable state sites and other domestic and foreign remediation sites  including currently owned facilities and previously owned sites 
also  opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal  state and local environmental laws 
these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties 
occidental manages its environmental remediation efforts through a wholly owned subsidiary  glenn springs holdings  inc  which reports its results directly to occidental s corporate management 
the following table presents occidental s environmental remediation reserves at december   and  grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites amounts in millions of sites reserve balance of sites reserve balance of sites reserve balance cercla equivalent sites active facilities closed or sold facilities total the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years in millions balance beginning of year remediation expense and interest accretion changes from acquisitions payments other balance end of year occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next three years and the balance over the next ten or more years 
occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites 
the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to million beyond the amount accrued 
for management s opinion  refer to the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section above 
cercla and equivalent sites as of december   opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in cercla or state equivalent proceedings  as shown below 
description amounts in millions of sites reserve balance minimal no exposure a reserves between mm reserves over mm total a includes sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental  sites where occidental has denied liability without challenge  sites where occidental s reserves are less than  each  and sites where reserves are between  and million each 
the six sites with individual reserves over million in include a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee  two closed landfills in western new york and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants montague  michigan  western new york and tacoma  washington 
active facilities certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at active facilities 
five facilities a chemical plant in louisiana  a phosphorus recovery operation in tennessee  a chemical plant in texas  a chemical plant in kansas and certain oil and gas properties in the southwestern united states account for percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 
closed or sold facilities there are sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which opc or its subsidiaries are involved 
five sites account for percent of the reserves associated with this group 
the five sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions  a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania  a closed occ chemical plant in pennsylvania  a closed landfill in western new york and a water treatment facility at a former occ chemical plant in north carolina 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets are located outside of north america 
occidental conducts its financial affairs so as to mitigate its exposure against risks associated with the locations of these assets 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion are located in the middle east north africa  approximately billion are located in latin america  and substantially all of the remainder are located in the other eastern hemisphere region 
for the year ended december   net sales outside north america totaled billion  or approximately percent of total net sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental s management 
there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years 
the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas properties occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
at the completion of drilling activities  the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found 
if no proved reserves have been found  the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense 
in some cases  a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling  requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells 
occidental s practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete 
occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 
annual lease rentals and geological  geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 
several factors could change occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves 
occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
in other contractual arrangements  sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
these factors  in turn  could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves 
an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates being different from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded 
occidental s revisions to proved reserves were positive for and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for the year 
in  revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for the year 
in  revisions to proved reserves were positive and amounted to approximately percent of the total reserves 
additionally  occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to sfas no 
 generally when prices decline and or reserve estimates change significantly 
there have been no sfas no 
impairments of oil and gas assets over the past three years 
if occidental s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on the dd a rate 
for example  a percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel  which would increase pre tax income by million annually 
a percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million annually 
dd a of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves 
the change in the dd a rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 
a portion of the carrying value of occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties  net of accumulated valuation allowance  were billion 
the acquisition of vintage resulted in an addition of billion of unproved properties in no goodwill was recorded on this transaction 
during  approximately million of the unproved property amount was moved to proved properties 
the unproved amounts are not subject to dd a or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves 
as exploration and development work progresses  if reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 
chemical assets the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its pp e 
occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method  based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities 
the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical assets  which range from years to years  are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests 
the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained 
without these continued expenditures  the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease 
other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy prices  environmental regulations and technological changes 
over the prior three years  the change in the depreciation rate due to changes in estimated useful lives has been immaterial 
occidental performs impairment tests on its assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  or when management s plans change with respect to those assets 
occidental compares the undiscounted future cash flows of an asset to its carrying value 
the key factors that could significantly affect future cash flows are future product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy costs  regulations and remaining estimated useful life 
impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values 
subsequent to the purchase of the vulcan chemical assets  occidental reviewed all of its chemical assets and decided to close its least competitive plants and upgrade the remaining operations 
as a result of this review  occidental recorded a million pre tax charge for the write off of two previously idled chemical plants and one operating plant and a pre tax additional charge of million for the write down of another chemical plant in occidental s net pp e for chemicals is approximately billion and its depreciation expense for is expected to be approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense 
for example  a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
the environmental reserves are based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available 
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable 
the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established 
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable 
as of december  and  occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 
many factors could result in changes to occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss 
the most significant are the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate 
modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results 
occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective 
such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater  or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results 
should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives  more intensive or costly measures may be required 
the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction 
site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates  anomalies in subsurface geology  interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones  or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources 
the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action 
additionally  other events might occur that could affect occidental s future remediation costs  such as the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated 
for some sites with impacted groundwater  accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling 
migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected 
additionally  the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures 
improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation 
in particular  for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance  the development of more effective treatment technology  or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation  could significantly affect remediation costs 
laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements 
at sites involving multiple parties  occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability 
when other parties are jointly liable  the financial viability of the parties  the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidental s ultimate share of liability 
based on these factors  occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties  with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable  in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories category cercla or state equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations  category oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost  and category contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 
in all three of these categories  occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities  as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 
in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures  which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites  occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems 
to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data  laws  regulations  technologies or engineering estimates  occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis 
if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
for example  if the reserve balance were to decrease by percent  occidental would record a pre tax gain of million 
if the reserve balance were to increase by percent  occidental would record an additional remediation expense of million 
other loss contingencies occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits  claims  proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations 
occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  occidental discloses  in aggregate  its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred 
occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 
these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate 
management s judgments could change based on new information  changes in laws or regulations  changes in management s plans or intentions  the outcome of legal proceedings  settlements or other factors 
significant accounting changes listed below are significant changes in accounting principles

sfas no 
r on july   occidental early adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments  under the modified prospective transition method 
since most of occidental s existing stock based compensation was already being recorded in the income statement  occidental decided to early adopt sfas r so that the remaining awards would be accounted for in a similar manner 
prior to july   occidental applied the apb opinion no 
intrinsic value accounting method for its stock incentive plans 
under the modified prospective transition method  the fair value recognition provisions apply only to new awards or awards modified after july  additionally  the fair value of existing unvested awards at the date of adoption is recorded in compensation expense over the remaining requisite service period 
results from prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting this statement in the third quarter of  occidental recorded a million after tax credit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principles 
eitf issue no 
in september  the eitf finalized the provisions of eitf issue no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  which provides accounting guidance about whether buy sell arrangements should be accounted for at historical cost and whether these arrangements should be reported on a gross or net basis 
buy sell arrangements typically are contractual arrangements where the buy and sell agreements are entered into in contemplation of one another with the same counterparty 
occidental reports all buy sell arrangements on a net basis and at historical cost 
this issue was effective in the first interim period beginning after march  occidental prospectively adopted this issue in the second quarter of and there was no material effect on the financial statements upon adoption 
derivative activities and market risk general occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price and rate fluctuations 
a derivative is an instrument that  among other characteristics  derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 
in general  the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 
commodity price risk general occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately million 
if natural gas prices vary by per mcf  it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately million 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices  however  changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins 
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million and million pre tax annual effect on income  respectively 
if pvc prices vary by 
lb  it would have approximately a million pre tax annual effect on income 
if ethylene dichloride edc prices vary by ton  it would have approximately a million pre tax annual effect on income 
historically  price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock price changes  therefore  the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated 
according to chemical market associates  inc  december average contract prices were chlorine ton  caustic soda ton  pvc lb and edc ton 
marketing and trading operations occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas 
derivatives have been used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization  which operates under established policy controls and procedures 
with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental utilizes a combination of futures  forwards  options and swaps to offset various physical transactions 
occidental s use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases  which includes occidental s periodic gas storage activities 
risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying  selling  marketing  trading  and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy 
the chief financial officer and the risk management committee  comprising members of occidental s management  oversee these controls  which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer 
the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities 
controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk  limits on credit  limits on trading  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls

the underlying prices for years and thereafter are based on the year end nymex published prices  as published monthly prices are not available 
these prices are entered into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value 
production hedges in  occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and costless collar agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges for the sale of a portion of its crude oil production 
additionally  occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the vintage acquisition 
these hedges continue to the end of the volume that was hedged was less than percent of occidental s crude oil and natural gas production 
information about these cash flow hedges  which are included in the total fair value of million in the table above  is presented in a tabular presentation below as of december  volumes in thousands of barrels crude oil fixed price swaps costless collars daily volume average price daily volume average floor average cap natural gas swaps fixed price basis mmbtu day a daily volume average price daily volume average price a one mmbtu is one million british thermal units  which equals approximately mcf

this method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a percent level of confidence 
the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of interest rate risk general occidental s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations 
in  occidental terminated all of its interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges 
these hedges had effectively converted approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in and the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower  as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain  by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
occidental was a party to a series of forward interest rate locks  which qualified as cash flow hedges 
the hedges were related to the construction of a cogeneration plant leased by occidental that was completed in december the unamortized loss on the hedges at december  was approximately million after tax  which is recorded in accumulated oci and is being recognized in earnings over the lease term of years on a straight line basis

credit risk occidental s energy contracts are spread among several counterparties 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure 
losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented 
foreign currency risk a few of occidental s foreign operations have currency risk 
occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
most international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  all of occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the us dollar as the functional currency 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rate transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial
