item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading national radio broadcast company whose business is acquiring  developing and operating radio stations located throughout the united states 
cox enterprises indirectly owns approximately of our common stock and has approximately of the voting power of cox radio 
the primary source of our revenues is the sale of local and national advertising for broadcast on our radio stations 
historically  approximately and of our net revenues have been generated from local and national advertising  respectively 
in addition to the sale of advertising time for cash  our stations also exchange advertising time for goods  services or programming  which can be used by the stations in their business operations 
the use of such barter transactions is generally confined to promotional items or services for which we would otherwise have paid cash 
barter transactions for programming are used to supplement station program offerings 
advertising spots given up under these arrangements are based on contractual terms 
in addition  it is our general policy not to pre empt advertising spots paid for in cash with advertising spots paid for in trade 
our most significant station operating expenses are employees salaries and benefits  commissions  programming expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
our revenues vary throughout the year 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  our revenues and operating income are typically lowest in the first quarter 
our operating results in any period may be affected by the incurrence of advertising and promotional expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 

table of contents critical accounting estimates use of estimates our accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the radio broadcasting industry 
an accounting estimate would be a critical accounting estimate for purposes of the disclosure in this report only if it meets two criteria 
first  the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made 
second  it must be the case that different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
the estimates and assumptions we use are based on historical experience and other factors  which management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to intangible assets  bad debts  contingencies and litigation  income taxes and fair value of financial instruments as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates and assumptions and could have a material impact on the carrying value of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and results of operations for the reporting periods 
we believe the following are the critical accounting estimates that require the most significant judgments and assumptions and are particularly susceptible to a significant change in the preparation of the financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of fcc broadcast licenses  but also include goodwill and certain other intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are indefinite lived intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over the contractual lives of the assets 
we evaluate our fcc licenses for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
fcc licenses are evaluated for impairment at the market level using the direct method 
if the carrying amount of fcc licenses is greater than their estimated fair value in a given market  the carrying amount of fcc licenses in that market is reduced to its estimated fair value 
based on our annual impairment test as of december   we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million million after tax to reduce the carrying value of our fcc licenses in the birmingham  greenville  houston  louisville and richmond markets to their fair value 
we also evaluate goodwill in each of our reporting units markets for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain circumstances are present  using the residual method 
if the carrying amount of goodwill in a reporting unit is greater than its implied value  determined from the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit is reduced to its estimated fair value 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   we recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill in the louisville market to its fair market value 
we utilize independent appraisals in testing fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment 
these appraisals principally use the discounted cash flow methodology 
this income approach consists of a quantitative model  which incorporates variables such as market advertising revenues  market revenue share projections  anticipated operating profit margins and various discount rates 
the variables used in the analysis reflect historical station and advertising market growth trends  as well as anticipated performance and market conditions 
multiples of operating cash flow are also considered 
we evaluate amortizing intangible assets for recoverability when circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred  using an undiscounted cash flow methodology 
if the future undiscounted cash flows for the intangible asset are less than net book value  net book value is reduced to the estimated fair value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts and notes receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific party s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
for all other parties  the evaluation considers the balance of aged receivables  the nature and volume of the portfolio  specific problem accounts and notes receivable  and economic conditions that may affect the debtor s ability to repay  and such other factors as  in our judgment  deserve recognition under existing economic conditions 
accounts and notes receivable are charged off to the allowance when  in our opinion  such receivables are deemed to be uncollectible 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
in addition  we consider the customer s creditworthiness prior to revenue recognition 
contingencies and litigation on an on going basis  we evaluate our exposures related to contingencies and litigation and record a liability when available information indicates that a liability is probable and estimable 
we also disclose significant matters that are reasonably possible to result in a loss or are probable but not estimable 

table of contents income tax estimates the provision for income taxes is based on current period income  changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities  changes in our operations in various jurisdictions  income tax rates and tax positions taken on returns 
we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
significant judgment is required in assessing and estimating the application and interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations 
in the normal course of business  our filed tax returns are subject to examination by taxing authorities 
these examinations could result in challenges to tax positions that we have taken 
these challenges could arise from a variety of tax issues such as the deductibility of certain expenses  the timing of the recognition of income and expense  allocations of income and expense between states  the tax basis of certain assets and the taxation of acquisitions and disposals 
ultimately  the results of these challenges could require us to pay additional taxes and could also require the payment of interest assessments 
we accrue a liability when we believe an assessment is probable 
financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes became effective for cox radio on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we are currently finalizing our evaluation of the impact of adoption and have not yet determined the effect on our financial position or results of operations 
during  we received a million refund related to the conclusion of a federal income tax audit for the tax years 
adjustments made during federal income tax audits for the tax years gave rise to this refund 
there was no material income statement impact in the current year 
the internal revenue service has initiated a field examination for tax periods and additionally  in connection with the conclusion of several state audits during  we paid million and recorded a corresponding reduction to income tax expense of million 
during and  in connection with the conclusion of federal income tax audits for the years  we paid approximately million in taxes related to certain radio station transactions completed during the audit period 
we had previously provided for the possibility of this outcome 
as a result of the audit  a reclassification between current and deferred tax liability and expense was made during results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto

this guarantee expires in february if the signal upgrade is approved by the fcc  then we are likely to purchase the stations and performance under the guarantee will not be necessary 
if the signal upgrade is not approved  our guarantee will be extinguished either through sale of the stations or through new financing arranged by the owner of the stations

transactions with affiliated companies we receive certain management services from  and have entered into certain transactions with  cox enterprises 
costs of the management services that are allocated to us are based on actual direct costs incurred or on cox enterprises estimate of expenses relative to the management services provided to other subsidiaries of cox enterprises 
we believe that these allocations were made on a reasonable basis  and that receiving these management services from cox enterprises creates cost efficiencies  however  there has been no study or any attempt to obtain quotes from third parties to determine what the cost of obtaining such services from third parties would have been 
the services and transactions described below have been reviewed by our audit committee  which has determined that such services and transactions are fair and in our best interest 
we receive day to day cash management services from cox enterprises  with settlements of outstanding balances between us and cox enterprises occurring periodically at market interest rates 
as a part of these services  cox enterprises transfers funds to cover our checks presented for payment and we record a book overdraft  which is classified as accounts payable in the accompanying balance sheets 
book overdrafts of million and million existed at december  and  respectively  as a result of our checks outstanding 
the amounts due to or from cox enterprises are generally due on demand and represent the net balance of the intercompany transactions 
the rate charged on intercompany borrowing is defined as cox enterprises current commercial paper borrowing rate or a libor based rate and at december  and  respectively  dependent upon our credit rating

expenses allocated for these services are included in corporate general and administrative expenses in the consolidated financial statements 
we were allocated expenses for the years ended december   and of approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to these services 
in connection with these management services  we reimburse cox enterprises for payments made to third party vendors for certain goods and services provided to us under arrangements made by cox enterprises on behalf of cox enterprises and its affiliates  including cox radio 
we believe such arrangements allow us to receive such goods and services at more attractive pricing than we would be able to secure separately 
such reimbursed expenditures include insurance premiums for coverage through cox enterprises insurance program  which provides coverage for all of its affiliates  including cox radio 
rather than self insuring these risks  cox enterprises purchases insurance for a fixed premium cost from several insurance companies  including an insurance company indirectly owned by descendants of governor james m

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  which became effective for cox radio on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we are currently finalizing our evaluation of the impact of adoption and have not yet determined the effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab no 
was effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  the implementation of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  with limited exceptions  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan in the year in which the changes occur as a component of comprehensive income 
the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows because we do not sponsor a defined benefit plan 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to a number of financial market risks in the ordinary course of business 
we have examined exposures to these risks and concluded that none of the exposures in these areas are material to cash flows or earnings  however  our primary financial market risk exposure pertains to changes in interest rates 
we have engaged in several strategies to manage these market risks 
we currently have one interest rate swap agreement for purposes of managing borrowing costs 
pursuant to this interest rate swap agreement  we have exchanged our floating rate interest obligations on million in notional principal amount of debt for a fixed annual interest rate of 
this agreement matures on september  concurrently with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in january  we formally designated this agreement as a cash flow hedge as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to a credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to the interest rate swap agreement 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by such counterparty  and no material loss would be expected in the event of the counterparty s nonperformance 
the estimated fair value of this swap agreement  based on current market rates  approximated a net payable of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the fair value of the swap agreement at december  is included in other current liabilities according to the maturity date of the swap 
the market risk for the interest rate swap is mitigated as the variable rate received is hedged to the variable rate paid on the credit facility 
the estimated fair values of debt instruments are based on discounted cash flow analyses using our borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements and dealer quotations 
the revolving credit facilities and cox enterprises borrowings bear interest based on current market rates and  thus  approximate fair value 
we are exposed to interest rate volatility with respect to these variable rate debt instruments 
if the libor borrowing rates were to increase above the current rates at december   our interest expense on the revolving credit facility would increase approximately million on an annual basis  including any interest expense associated with the use of derivative rate hedging instruments as described above 
with respect to the interest rate swap agreement  we have estimated its fair value using available market information and valuation methodologies that we believe to be appropriate 
considerable judgment  however  is required in interpreting market data to develop the estimate of fair value 
accordingly  the estimate presented above is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we would realize or pay in a current market exchange
