item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 

table of contents us gaap does not permit establishing loss reserves until the occurrence of an actual loss event 
once such an event occurs  we establish reserves based upon estimates of total losses as a result of the event and our estimate of the portion of the loss we have insured or reinsured 
as a result  we set aside only loss reserves applicable to losses incurred up to the reporting date  with no allowance for the provision of a contingency reserve to account for expected future losses 
we will estimate and recognize losses arising from future events at the time the loss is incurred 
to assist us in establishing appropriate reserves for losses and loss expense  we analyze a significant amount of insurance industry information with respect to the pricing environment and loss settlement patterns 
in combination with our individual pricing analyses  we use this industry information to guide our loss and loss expense estimates 
we regularly review these estimates  and we reflect adjustments  if any  in earnings in the periods in which they are determined 
we have engaged  and we expect that we will continue  from time to time  to engage  independent external actuarial specialists to review specific reserving methods and results 
for more discussion of our estimation and establishment of loss reserves  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations 
with respect to the year ended december   in establishing our aggregate reserves for losses and loss expenses  we reviewed reserve estimates of an actuary employed with our company and of an external actuarial specialist 
we recorded these aggregate reserves as of the year ended december  based on the highest aggregate reserve amount of the estimates we reviewed 
while we believe that we are able to make a reasonable estimate of our ultimate losses  we may not be able to predict our ultimate claims experience as reliably as other companies that have had insurance and reinsurance operations for a substantial period of time  and we cannot assure you that our losses and loss expenses will not exceed our total reserves 
ceded reinsurance syndicate cedes a portion of its written premiums through excess of loss treaty and facultative reinsurance contracts  as well as other agreements  which provide substantially similar financial protections 
prior to ceasing the writing of insurance other than in syndicate  we also ceded a portion of our written premiums and purchased retrocessional coverage  which is reinsurance of a reinsurer s business 
we use ceded reinsurance to lower our net exposure to our planned net limit and risk of individual loss  to control our aggregate exposures to a particular risk or class of risks and to reduce our overall risk of loss 
reinsurance companies cede risks under retrocessional agreements to other reinsurers  known as retrocessionaires  for reasons similar to those that cause primary insurers to purchase reinsurance 
the amount of ceded reinsurance and retrocessional protection that we purchased varied based on business segment market conditions  pricing terms and credit risk  as well as other factors 
ceded reinsurance and retrocessional protection do not relieve us of our obligations to our insureds or reinsureds 
we must pay these obligations without the benefit of reinsurance to the extent our reinsurers or retocessionaires do not pay us 
we evaluate and monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we seek to purchase reinsurance from entities rated a or better by standard and poor s or am best  and we regularly monitor collectibility  make balance sheet provisions for amounts we consider potentially uncollectible and request collateral where possible 
investments our board of directors established our investment policies and mandated a list of authorized investments for company funds 
management implements our investment strategy with the assistance of external managers  who use guidelines which are created by us and compliant with the investment mandates of our board to establish their portfolios 
our investment guidelines specify minimum criteria on the overall credit quality  liquidity and risk return characteristics of our investment 
table of contents portfolio and include limitations on the size of particular holdings  as well as restrictions on investments in different asset classes 
the board of directors monitors our overall investment returns and reviews compliance with our investment guidelines 
our investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize total return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
investment decision making is guided mainly by the nature and timing of our expected liability payouts  management s forecast of our cash flows and the possibility that we will have unexpected cash demands  for example  to satisfy claims due to catastrophic losses 
our investment portfolio currently consists mainly of highly rated and liquid fixed income securities 
however  to the extent our insurance liabilities are correlated with an asset class outside our minimum criteria  our investment guidelines will allow a deviation from those minimum criteria provided such deviations reduce overall risk 
our investment guidelines require compliance with applicable local regulations and laws 
without board approval  we will not purchase financial futures  forwards  options  swaps and other derivatives  except for instruments that are purchased as part of our business  for purposes of hedging capital market risks including those within our structured product transactions  or as replication transactions  which are defined as a set of derivative  insurance and or securities transactions that when combined produce the equivalent economic results of an investment meeting our investment guidelines 
while we expect that the majority of our investment holdings will continue to be denominated in us dollars  we may make investments in ot her currency denominations depending upon the currencies in which loss reserves are maintained  or as may be required by regulation or law 
risk management in syndicate in syndicate  underwriting authority has been granted to mark h 
wheeler who  in turn  has issued detailed letters of underwriting authority to each of the leaders of our product lines at lloyd s 
mr 
wheeler reviews these letters annually 
these letters contain underwriting eligibility criteria and quantifiable limits depending on the product line 
with respect to syndicate  we believe we employ a disciplined approach to underwriting and risk management that relies heavily upon the collective underwriting expertise of our management and staff 
we believe this expertise is guided by the following underwriting principles

additionally  underwriters at syndicate use contract exclusions and terms and conditions  as appropriate  to further eliminate particular risk exposures that our underwriting team deems to be unacceptable 
relationships with brokers in syndicate during  syndicate produced substantially all of its business through insurance brokers worldwide who receive a brokerage commission usually equal to a percentage of gross premiums 
brokerage commissions are generally negotiated on a policy by policy basis 
aon ltd and marsh ltd 
accounted for approximately and of the gross premiums of syndicate during seven other brokers accounted for approximately of additional gross premiums of syndicate during competition for syndicate the insurance industry is highly competitive 
syndicate competes both within the lloyd s market and with insurance carriers outside of the lloyd s market 
competition varies depending on the type of business being insured or reinsured 
syndicate competes on an international and 
table of contents regional basis with major us  bermuda  european and other international insurers and certain underwriting syndicates 
if syndicate seeks to broaden the markets in which it does business  we will encounter additional competition 
many of these competitors have more  and in some cases substantially more  capital and greater marketing and management resources than we expect to have  and may offer a broader range of products and more competitive pricing than we expect to  or will be able to  offer 
because syndicate has a limited operating history  many of its competitors also have greater name and brand recognition 
in the specialty market  competition tends to focus more on availability  service and other value based considerations than on price 
if we provide additional specialty insurance products to a broader market of clients  we anticipate that competition will mostly be based on product and underwriting expertise  premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered 
competition in the types of business that we underwrite is based on many factors  including

increased competition could result in fewer applications for coverage  lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms  which could adversely impact our growth and profitability 
in addition  capital markets participants have recently created alternative products that are intended to compete with reinsurance products 
we are unable to predict the extent to which new  proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for our products or the risks that may be available for us to consider underwriting 
regulation the business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries  although the degree and type of regulation varies significantly from one jurisdiction to another

uk regulation regulation of syndicate at lloyd s we participate in the lloyd s market through syndicate syndicate s operations are subject to regulation by the uk financial services authority the fsa and the council of lloyd s 
the fsa is responsible under the financial services and markets act for regulating uk insurers 
it regulates the society of lloyd s as well as individual lloyd s managing agents 
the council of lloyd s regulates lloyd s members and lloyd s managing agents 
our subsidiary  quanta  is a corporate member of lloyd s 
in  it was the sole member of syndicate for the year of account  it will provide of the capacity of syndicate for future years of account it is expected that its maximum commitment will be the amount of its current commitment which may  or may not be  the same percentage of the capacity of syndicate as the year of account 
as a corporate member of lloyd s  quanta is bound by the rules of the society of lloyd s  which are prescribed by byelaws and requirements made by the council of lloyd s under powers conferred by the lloyd s act these govern quanta s participation on syndicate and among other matters prescribe its membership subscription  the level of its contribution to the lloyd s central fund and the assets it must deposit with lloyd s in support of its underwriting 
quanta is not as a member of lloyd s subject to direct regulation by the fsa 
the council of lloyd s has broad powers to sanction breaches of its rules  including the power to restrict or prohibit a member s participation on lloyd s syndicates 
in addition  the fsa monitors lloyd s rules to ensure these are adequate to allow the society of lloyd s to meet its own regulatory obligations to the fsa 
during  syndicate was managed by chaucer syndicates limited 
for  syndicate will be managed by pembroke managing agency limited  which is owned by pembroke jv 
we hold an interest in pembroke managing agency limited through our share ownership in its parent  pembroke jv 
lloyd s managing agents are subject to overlapping supervision by the council of lloyd s and the fsa 
under the fsa s regulatory regime  managing agents are required  among other matters  to adopt internal systems and controls appropriate to the risks of their business  obtain regulatory approval for those members of staff responsible for performing certain controlled functions and calculate the level of capital required t o support the underwriting of the syndicates that they manage 
they are also required to conduct their business according to eleven core regulatory principles  to which all firms regulated by the fsa are subject 
the fsa and the council of lloyd s have entered into an agreement by which the council of lloyd s undertakes primary supervision of managing agents in relation to certain aspects of the fsa s regulatory regime 
this arrangement is intended to minimize duplication of supervision 
each member of lloyd s is required to deposit cash  securities or letters of credit or a combination of these assets with lloyd s to support its participation on lloyd s syndicates 
these assets are known as members funds at lloyd s 
members funds at lloyd s requirements are calculated according to a minimum capital resources requirement  which is assessed at syndicate level by lloyd s and at the level of the lloyd s market as a whole by the fsa 
this requirement is similar in effect to a required solvency margin 
at syndicate level  managing agents are required to calculate the capital resources requirements of the members of each syndicate they manage 
they do this by carrying out a syndicate individual capital assessment ica according to detailed rules prescribed by the fsa 
the ica process evaluates the risks faced by the syndicate  including insurance risk  operational risk  market risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and group risk  and assesses the amount of capital that syndicate members should hold against those risks 
lloyd s reviews each syndicate s ica annually and may challenge it 
an ica for syndicate for the underwriting year was submitted to lloyd s in september and has 
table of contents been reviewed and approved by lloyd s 
in order to ensure that lloyd s aggregate capital is maintained at a high enough level to support its overall security rating  lloyd s adds an uplift to the capital requirement figure produced by the ica  the uplift being expected to be on average across the lloyd s market 
this uplifted figure is known as a syndicate s economic capital assessment eca 
lloyd s uses the eca to calculate each syndicate member s funds at lloyd s requirement 
at a lloyd s market level  lloyd s is required to demonstrate to the fsa that each member s capital resources requirement is met by that member s available capital resources  which for this purpose comprises its funds at lloyd s  its share of member capital held at syndicate level and the funds held within the lloyd s central fund 
in this way the fsa monitors the solvency of the lloyd s market as a whole 
the council of lloyd s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members underwriting at lloyd s 
it may  for instance  vary the amount of a member s funds at lloyd s requirement or alter the ways in which those funds may be invested 
the exercise of any of these powers may reduce the amount of premium which a member is allowed to accept for its account in an underwriting year and or increase a member s costs of doing business at lloyd s 
as a consequence  the member s ability to achieve an anticipated return on capital during that year may be compromised 
each syndicate is required to submit a business plan to lloyd s on an annual basis  which is subject to the review and approval of the lloyd s franchise board 
the lloyd s franchise board was formally constituted on january  and has become managing agents principal interface with the council of lloyd s 
the main goal of the franchise board is to seek to create and maintain a commercial environment at lloyd s in which underwriting risk is prudently managed while providing maximum long term returns to capital providers 
the underwriting year business plan of syndicate was submitted to lloyd s in september and has been reviewed and approved by lloyd s 
lloyd s syndicates are treated as annual ventures and members participation on syndicates may change from underwriting year to underwriting year 
ordinarily  a syndicate will accept business over the course of one calendar year an underwriting year of account  which will remain open for a further two calendar years before being closed by means of reinsurance to close 
an underwriting year may be reinsured to close by the next underwriting year of the same syndicate or by an underwriting year of a different syndicate 
lloyd s moved to annual accounting on january  previously  the market operated according to a three year accounting cycle  so that members were not able to take profits made in an underwriting year until it had been reinsured to close  usually at the end of three years 
now  provided that certain solvency requirements are met  underwriting profits may effectively be taken in part before the year has been reinsured to close 
once an underwriting year has been reinsured to close  lloyd s will release the members funds at lloyd s provided that these are not required to support the members other underwriting years or to meet a loss made on the closed underwriting year 
if reinsurance to close ca nnot be obtained at the end of an underwriting year s third open year either at all  or on terms that the managing agent considers to be acceptable on behalf of the members participating on that underwriting year  then the managing agent of the syndicate must determine that the underwriting year will remain open 
if the managing agent determines to keep the underwriting year open  then the syndicate will be considered to be in run off  and the funds at lloyd s of the participating members will continue to be held by lloyd s to support their continuing liabilities unless the members can show that their funds at lloyd s are in excess of the amount required to be held in respect of their liabilities in relation to that year 
the reinsurance to close of an underwriting year does not discharge participating members from the insurance liabilities they incurred during that year 
rather  it provides them with a full indemnity from the members participating on the reinsuring underwriting year in respect of those liabilities 
therefore  even after all the underwriting years on which a member has participated have been reinsured to close  the member is required to stay in existence and to remain a non underwriting member of lloyd s 
accordingly  although lloyd s will release members funds at lloyd s  there nevertheless continues to be an administrative and financial burden for corporate members between 
table of contents the time of the reinsurance to close of the underwriting years on which they participated and the time that their insurance obligations are entirely extinguished 
this includes the completion of financial accounts in accordance with the companies act and the submission of an annual compliance declaration to lloyd s 
underwriting losses incurred by a syndicate during an underwriting year must be paid according to the links in the lloyd s chain of security 
claims must be funded first from the members premiums trust fund which is held under the control of the syndicate managing agent and then from members funds at lloyd s 
in the event that any member is unable to pay its debts owed to policyholders from these assets  such debts may  at the discretion of the council of lloyd s  be paid by the lloyd s central fund 
the central fund is funded by an annual levy imposed on members which is determined annually by lloyd s as a percentage of each member s underwriting capacity for and  and by an interest bearing subordinated loan made by members  which is repaid and replaced on a three year rolling basis 
in and  the loan was of each member s underwriting capacity 
in addition  the council of lloyd s has power to call on members to make an additional contribution to the central fund of up to of their underwriting capacity each year should it decide that such additional contributions are necessary 
lloyd s also makes other charges on its members and the syndicates on which they participate  including an annual subscription charge of underwriting capacity in and and an overseas business charge  levied as a percentage of gross international premiums that is premiums on business outside the uk and the channel islands  with the percentage depending on the type of business written 
lloyd s also has power to impose additional charges under lloyd s powers of charging byelaw 
us regulation quanta indemnity and quanta specialty lines are regulated insurance companies in colorado and indiana respectively 
holding company acts state insurance holding company system statutes and related regulations provide a regulatory apparatus that is designed to protect the financial condition of domestic insurers operating within a holding company system 
all insurance holding company statutes require disclosure and  in some instances  prior approval of material transactions between the domestic insurer and an affiliate 
these transactions typically include sales  purchases  exchanges  loans and extensions of credit  reinsurance agreements  service agreements  guarantees and investments between an insurance company and its affiliates  involving in the aggregate specified percentages of an insurance company s admitted assets or policyholders surplus  or dividend s that exceed specified percentages of an insurance company s surplus or income 
the state insurance holding company system statutes may discourage potential acquisition proposals  such as other us insurers whom we may wish to acquire  and may delay  deter or prevent a change of control of quanta holdings  quanta us holdings  quanta indemnity or quanta specialty lines including through transactions  and in particular unsolicited transactions  that we or our shareholders might consider to be desirable 
before a person can acquire control of a domestic insurer or reinsurer  prior written approval must be obtained from the insurance commissioner of the state where the domestic insurer is domiciled 
prior to granting approval of an application to acquire control of a domestic insurer  the state insurance commissioner where the insurer is domiciled will consider such factors as the financial strength of the applicant  the integrity and management of the applicant s board of directors and executive officers  the acquiror s plans for the future operations of the domestic insurer and any anti competitive results that may arise from the closing of the acquisition of control 
generally  state statutes provide that lsq uo  control over a domestic insurer is presumed to exist if any person  directly or 
table of contents indirectly  owns  controls  holds with the power to vote  or holds proxies representing  ten percent or more of the voting securities of the domestic insurer 
because a person acquiring ten percent or more of the common shares of quanta holdings would indirectly acquire the same percentage of quanta specialty lines and quanta indemnity s common stock  the us insurance change of control laws will likely apply to such a transaction 
typically  the holding company statutes will also require each of our us subsidiaries periodically to file information with state insurance regulatory authorities  including information concerning capital structure  ownership  financial condition and general business operations 
regulation of dividends and other payments from insurance subsidiaries the ability of a us insurer to pay dividends or make other distributions is subject to insurance regulatory limitations of the insurance company s state of domicile 
generally  these laws require prior regulatory approval before an insurer may pay a dividend or make a distribution above a specified level 
in many us jurisdictions  including the state of indiana where quanta specialty lines is domiciled and the state of colorado where quanta indemnity is domiciled  dividends may only be paid out of earned surplus and may not exceed the greater of of the insurer s statutory surplus as of the end of the last preceding calendar year or levels of the insurer s net income for the prior calendar year 
in addition  the laws of many us jurisdictions require an insurer to report for informational purposes to the insurance commissioner of its state of domicile all declarations and proposed payments of dividends and other distributions to security holders 
any return of capital from a us insurance company would require prior approval of the domestic regulators 
the dividend limitations imposed by the state laws are based on statutory financial results  determined by using statutory accounting practices which differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with us gaap 
the significant differences relate to treatment of deferred acquisition costs  deferred income taxes  required investment reserves  reserve calculation assumptions and surplus notes 
in connection with the acquisition of a us insurer  insurance regulators in the united states often impose  as a condition to the approval of the acquisition  additional restrictions on the ability of the us insurer to pay dividends or make other distributions 
these restrictions generally prohibit the us insurer from paying dividends or making other distributions for a number of years without prior enhanced regulatory approval 
insurance regulatory information system ratios the naic insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values of the ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners regarding different aspects of an insurer s business 
insurers that report four or more unusual values are generally targeted for regulatory review 
accreditation the naic has instituted its financial regulatory accreditation standards program frasp in response to federal initiatives to regulate the business of insurance 
frasp provides a set of standards designed to establish effective state regulation of the financial condition of insurance companies 
under frasp  a state must adopt certain laws and regulations  institute required regulatory practices and procedures  and have adequate personnel to enforce these laws and regulations in order to become an accredited state 
accredited states are not able to accept certain financial examination reports of insurers prepared solely by the regulatory agency in an unaccredited state 
risk based capital requirements in order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency  the naic adopted in december a formula and model law to implement risk based capital requirements for property and casualty 
table of contents insurance companies 
these risk based capital requirements change from time to time and are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations 
the risk based capital model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers

insurers having less statutory surplus than required by the risk based capital calculation will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action  depending on the level of capital inadequacy 
equity investments in common stock typically are valued at of their market value under the risk based capital guidelines 
under the approved formula  an insurer s statutory surplus is compared to its risk based capital requirement 
if this ratio is above a minimum threshold  no company or regulatory action is necessary 
below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to risk based capital requirement decreases

guaranty funds and assigned risk plans most states require all admitted insurance companies to participate in their respective guaranty funds that cover various claims against insolvent insurers 
solvent insurers licensed in these states are required to cover the losses paid on behalf of insolvent insurers by the guaranty funds and are generally subject to annual assessments in the state by its guaranty fund to cover these losses 
some states also require licensed insurance companies to participate in assigned risk plans which provide coverage for automobile insurance and other lines for insureds which  for various reasons  cannot otherwise obtain insurance in the open market 
this participation may take the form of reinsuring a portion of a pool of policies or the dir ect issuance of policies to insureds 
the calculation of an insurer s participation in these plans is usually based on the amount of premium for that type of coverage that was written by the insurer on a voluntary basis in a prior year 
participation in assigned risk pools tends to produce losses which result in assessments to insurers writing the same lines on a voluntary basis 
credit for reinsurance licensed reinsurers in the united states are subject to insurance regulation and supervision that is similar to the regulation of licensed primary insurers 
however  the terms and conditions of reinsurance agreements generally are not subject to regulation by any governmental authority with respect to rates or policy terms 
this contrasts with primary insurance policies and agreements  the rates and terms of which generally are regulated by state insurance regulators 
as a practical matter  however  the rates charged by primary insurers do have an effect on the rates that can be charged by reinsurers 
a primary insurer ordinarily will enter into a reinsurance agreement only if it can obtain credit for the reinsurance ceded on its statutory financial statements 
in general  credit for reinsurance is allowed in the following circumstances

because quanta bermuda  quanta us re and quanta europe were not licensed  accredited or otherwise approved by or domiciled in any state in the united states  primary insurers were only willing to cede business to quanta bermuda  quanta us re and quanta europe if we provided adequate security to allow the primary insurer to take credit on its balance sheet for the reinsurance it purchased 
we typically provided this security through the posting of a letter of credit or deposit o f assets into a trust fund for the benefit of the primary insurer 
statutory accounting principles statutory accounting principles  or sap  is a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies 
it is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer s surplus to policyholders 
accordingly  statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer s domiciliary state 
us gaap is concerned with a company s solvency  but it is also concerned with other financial measurements  such as income and cash flows 
accordingly  us gaap gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management s stewardship of assets than does sap 
as a direct result  different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap as opposed to sap 
statutory accounting practices established by the naic and adopted  in part  by state insurance departments  will determine  among other things  the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of our us insurance subsidiaries  which will affect  in part  the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends to us 
federal regulation we are subject to numerous federal regulations  including the securities act of  the securities exchange act of the exchange act and other federal securities laws 
as we continue with the run off of our business  we must monitor our compliance with these laws  including our maintenance of any available exemptions from registration as an investment company under the investment company act of any failure to comply with these laws or maintain our exemption could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on the market price of our common and series a preferred securities 
although state regulation is the dominant form of regulation for insurance and reinsurance business  from time to time congress has shown concern over the adequacy and efficiency of the state regulation 
proposals have included the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to  or in lieu of  the current system of state regulation of insurers 
federal legislation is also being discussed that would require all states to adopt uniform standards relating to the regulation of products

the gramm leach bliley act glba which made fundamental changes in the regulation of the financial services industry in the united states was enacted on november  the glba permitted the transformation of the already converging banking  insurance and securities industries by allowing mergers that combine commercial banks  insurers and securities firms under one holding company  a financial holding company 
bank holding companies and other entities that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in activities  and acquire companies engaged in activities  that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to such financial activities 
such financial activities include acting as principal  agent or broker in the underwriting and sale of life  property  casualty and other forms of insurance and annuities 
until the passage of the glba  the glass steagall act of had limited the ability of banks to engage in securities related businesses  and the bank holding company act of  as amended  had restricted banks from being affiliated with insurers

the terrorism risk insurance act of  or tria  was enacted by the us congress and became effective in november in response to the tightening of supply in some insurance markets resulting from  among other things  the terrorist attacks of september  tria generally requires us property and casualty insurers  including lloyd s syndicates which conduct business in the us  to offer terrorism coverage for certified acts of terrorism to their policyholders at the same limits and terms as for other coverages

none of quanta holdings  quanta bermuda  quanta europe  quanta us holdings nor quanta specialty lines are incorporated in the uk accordingly  they should not be treated as being resident in the uk unless their central management and control is exercised in the uk the concept of central management and control is indicative of the highest level of control of a company  which is wholly a question of fact 
we intend to manage quanta holdings  quanta bermuda  quanta europe  quanta us holdings  quanta specialty lines and quanta indemnity so they are not resident in the uk for uk corporation tax purposes 
quanta and pembroke jv  as companies incorporated in the uk  are treated as being resident in the uk and are subject to uk corporation tax on their respective worldwide income and gains 
the maximum rate of uk corporation tax is currently uk permanent establishment 
as a matter of uk domestic tax law  a company not resident in the uk for uk corporation tax purposes can be subject to uk corporation tax if it carries on a trade in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk but the charge to uk corporation tax is limited to all profits including revenue profits and capital gains  wherever arising  that are attributable to such permanent establishment 
the term permanent establishment is defined for these purposes in a manner that is consistent with various internationally recognized characteristics commonly used in the uk s double tax treaties 
the maximum rate of uk corporation tax is currently 
we intend to operate in such a manner that none of quanta holdings nor any of its subsidiaries will carry on a trade in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk whether a trade is being carried on in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk is an inherently factual determination 
since uk case law and uk statutes fail to identify definitively activities that constitute a trade being carried on in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk  we cannot assure you that hm revenue customs will not contend successfully that quanta holdings or any of its subsidiaries has been or will be carrying on a trade in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk we believe that the uk subsidiaries of quanta holdings qualify for benefits under the tax treaty between the uk and the united states 
if any of our uk subsidiaries qualifying for such benefits were to be carrying on a trade in the uk through a uk permanent establishment  they would only be subject to uk corporation tax if the uk permanent establishment constituted a permanent establishment for the purposes of that treaty and then only to the extent that any profits were attributable to that permanent establishment in the uk determined in accordance with the provisions of the uk united states tax treaty 
the uk has no tax treaty with bermuda and if any of quanta holdings or our subsidiaries in bermuda were to be carrying on a trade in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk  they would be subject to uk corporation tax on all profits  wherever arising  attributable to that permanent establishment in accordance with the provisions of uk tax law 
there are circumstances in which companies that are neither resident in the uk nor entitled to the protection afforded by a tax treaty between the uk and the jurisdiction in which they are resident may be exposed to income tax in the uk on income arising in the uk other than by deduction or withholding but we intend to operate in such a manner that none of us will fall within the charge to income tax in the uk other than by deduction or withholding in this respect 
if we or any of our subsidiaries  other than any subsidiary incorporated in the uk as a contact office for quanta bermuda  were treated as being resident in the uk for uk corporation tax purposes  or  were to be carrying on a trade in the uk through a permanent establishment in the uk  the results of our operations and your investment could be materially adversely affected

as discussed further in this annual report and based on our expected business  properties  ownership  organization  source of income and manner of operation  we believe that no us person that owns shares in quanta holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities should be subject to treatment as a us shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation  or cfc  and quanta holdings should not be considered a passive foreign investment company  for the year ended december  we have not sought and do not intend to seek an opinion of legal counsel as to whether or not we were a passive foreign investment company for the year ended december  this summary is based upon the internal revenue code  the treasury regulations promulgated under the internal revenue code  rulings and other administrative pronouncements issued by the irs  judicial decisions  the tax treaty between the united states and bermuda  or the bermuda treaty and the tax treaty between the united states and ireland  or the irish treaty  all as currently in effect  and all of which are subject to differing interpretations or to change  possibly with retroactive effect 
no assurance can be given that the irs would not assert  or that a court would not sustain  a position contrary to any of the tax consequences described below 
no advance ruling has be en or will be sought from the irs regarding any matter discussed in this annual report 
this summary is for general information only  and does not purport to discuss all aspects of us federal income taxation that may be important to a particular investor in light of such investor s investment or tax circumstances  or to investors subject to special tax rules  such as shareholders who own directly  or indirectly through certain foreign entities or through the constructive ownership rules of the internal revenue code  or more of the voting power or value of quanta holdings or how those ownership rules may apply in certain circumstances  tax exempt organizations  dealers in securities  banks  insurance companies  persons that hold shares that are a hedge or that are hedged against interest rate or insurance risks or that are part of a straddle or conversion transaction  or persons whose functional currency is not the us dollar 
this summary generally does not discuss the federal alternative mini mum tax and federal taxes other than income tax or other us taxes such as state or local income taxes 
this summary assumes that an investor will acquire and hold our shares as capital assets  which generally means as property held for investment 
special rules  not discussed herein  apply to us persons who are partners in a partnership investing in shares 
prospective investors should consult their tax advisors concerning the consequences  in their particular circumstances  of the ownership of shares under us federal  state  local and other tax laws 
for us federal income tax purposes and purposes of the following discussion  a us person means a citizen or resident of the united states  a corporation or other entity created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any of its political subdivisions  an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income tax without regard to its source or a trust if a court within the united states is able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more us persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust  as well as certain electing trusts 
us taxation of quanta holdings  quanta bermuda  quanta europe  quanta us holdings  quanta specialty lines  quanta us re and quanta indemnity us income and branch profits tax 
a foreign corporation deemed to be engaged in the conduct of a trade or business in the us will generally be subject to us federal income tax at a current maximum rate of  as well as a branch profits tax in certain circumstances  on its income which is treated as effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business unless the corporation is entitled to relief under an applicable income tax treaty  as discussed below 
quanta holdings  quanta europe and quanta bermuda intend to operate in such a manner that they will not 
table of contents be considered to be conducting a trade or business within the united states for purposes of us federal income taxation 
whether a trade or business is being conducted in the united states is an inherently factual determination 
because the internal revenue code  treasury regulations and court decisions fail to identify definitively activities that constitute being engaged in a trade or business in the united states  we cannot assure you that the irs will not contend successfully that quanta holdings  quanta bermuda and or quanta europe are or will be engaged in a trade or business in the united states 
such income tax  if imposed  would be based on effectively connected income computed in a manner generally analogous to that applied to the income of a us corporation  except that a foreign corporation is entitled to deductions and credits only if it timely files a us federal income tax return which requirement may be waived if the foreign corporation establishes that it acted reasonably and in good fai th in its failure to timely file such return 
quanta holdings  quanta europe and quanta bermuda intend to file protective us federal income tax returns on a timely basis in order to preserve the right to claim income tax deductions and credits if it is ever determined that they are subject to us federal income tax 
an insurance enterprise resident in bermuda generally will be entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty if more than of its shares are owned beneficially  directly or indirectly  by individual residents of the united states or bermuda or us citizens and its income is not used in substantial part  directly or indirectly  to make disproportionate distributions to  or to meet certain liabilities of  persons who are neither residents of either the united states or bermuda nor us citizens 
quanta bermuda believes it is entitled to the benefits of the bermuda treaty 
assuming quanta bermuda is entitled to the benefits under the bermuda treaty  it will not be subject to us federal income tax on any insurance income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
whether business is being conducted in the united states through a permanent establishment is an inherently factual determination 
quanta bermuda intends to conduct its activities so as not to have a permanent establishment in the united states  although we cannot assure you that it will achieve this result 
a company resident in ireland will generally be entitled to the benefit of the irish treaty if more than of its shares are owned beneficially  directly or indirectly  by individual residents of the united states or ireland or us citizens and deductible amounts paid for certain purposes to persons who are neither residents of either the us or ireland  nor us citizens do not exceed of the irish company s income 
an irish company which does not meet those standards may nevertheless be entitled to the benefits of the irish treaty with respect to an item of income if the irish company is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in ireland  and the item of income is connected with or incidental t o that trade or business 
quanta europe believes it is entitled to the benefits of the irish treaty 
assuming quanta europe is entitled to the benefits of the irish treaty  it will not be subject to us federal income tax on any income found to be effectively connected with a us trade or business unless that trade or business is conducted through a permanent establishment in the united states 
quanta europe intends to conduct its activities in a manner so that it does not have a permanent establishment in the united states  although we cannot assure you that it will achieve this result 
if a non us company is characterized as engaged in an insurance business in the united states  a portion of its net investment income will be characterized as effectively connected with such us trade or business 
the amount so characterized depends on a formula 
it is unclear whether applicable income tax treaties apply to the characterization of net investment income and  if so  such benefit would only apply if the non us insurance company is eligible for such treaty benefit 
foreign corporations also are subject to us withholding tax at a rate of of the gross amount of certain fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains  profits and income derived from sources within the united states such as dividends and certain interest on investments  to the extent such amounts are not effectively connected with the foreign corporation s conduct of a trade or business in the united states 
the tax rate is subject to reduction by applicable treaties 
the bermuda treaty does not provide such a reduction 
dividends  if any  paid by quanta us holdings to quanta holdings  therefore  will be subject to us withholding tax 
the united states also imposes an 
table of contents excise tax on insurance and reinsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers or reinsurers with respect to risks located in the united states 
the rate of tax applicable to premiums paid to quanta bermuda is for insurance premiums and for reinsurance premiums 
the excise tax does not apply to premiums paid to quanta europe assuming that quanta europe is entitled to the benefits of the irish treaty  to the extent that quanta europe does not reinsure the risk with a reinsurer which is not entitled to the benefits of a bilateral tax treaty with the united states in which the united states has waived the excise tax 
quanta us holdings is a delaware corporation and quanta specialty lines is an indiana corporation 
quanta us re is a bermuda corporation that will be taxed as a us corporation pursuant to an election under section d of the internal revenue code 
each will be subject to taxation in the united states on its worldwide income at regular corporate rates 
personal holding companies 
quanta holdings us subsidiaries could be subject to additional us tax on a portion of their income earned from us sources if any of them is considered to be a personal holding company  or phc for us federal income tax purposes 
a corporation generally will be classified as a phc for us federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if at any time during the last half of such taxable year  five or fewer individuals without regard to their citizenship or residency own or are deemed to own pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules more than of the stock of the corporation by value and at least of the corporation s adjusted ordinary gross income  as determined for us federal income tax purposes  for such taxable year consists of phc income 
phc income includes  among other things  dividends  certain interest  certain royalties  annuities and  under certain circumstances  rents 
for purposes of the test  each partner of an investment partnership who is an individual will be treated as owning his her proportionate share of any stock owned by the partnership 
additionally  certain entities such as tax exempt organizations and pension funds will be treated as individuals 
the phc rules contain an exception for foreign corporations 
if any of quanta holdings us subsidiaries were a phc in a given taxable year  such corporation would be subject to phc tax on its undistributed phc income at a rate of 
for taxable years beginning after december   the phc tax rate would be the highest marginal rate on ordinary income applicable to individuals 
although quanta holdings believes that none of its us subsidiaries is a phc  we cannot provide assurance that this will be the case because of factors including legal and factual uncertainties regarding the application of the constructive ownership rules  the makeup of quanta holdings shareholder base  the gross income of quanta holdings us subsidiaries and other circumstances that could change the application of the phc rules to quanta holdings and its subsidiaries 
in addition  if any of quanta holdings us subsidiaries were to become phcs we cannot be certain that the amount of phc income would be immaterial 
employees as of march   following the transfer of certain employees to pembroke managing agency  we employed approximately full time employees 
these employees are mainly engaged in our run off activities 
five employees handle claims  six are engaged in assumed and ceded reinsurance  six serve in the policy servicing administration and the remainder deal with financial  legal  regulatory and general administrative matters 
we also engage temporary personnel when needed 
in order to retain the services of james j 
ritchie  our executive chairman  we have entered into an employment agreement with him 
in addition  in order to retain the services of jonathan jr dodd  our chief financial officer  and a number of other key employees  we have entered into retention agreements with these employees that provide for specified severance payments in the event of their termination without cause or following a change of control 
these agreements also contain non competition and non solicitation provisions 
however  generally  our other employees  including our chief executive officer  do not have non competition agreements with us nor agreements requiring us to employ them over a fixed term 
therefore  the se other employees  including our chief executive officer  may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time and are not restricted from seeking employment with others who may seek their expertise 

table of contents item a 
risk factors because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance  and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
though we have attempted to list comprehensively important cautionary risk factors  we wish to caution investors and others that other factors may in the future prove to be important in affecting our business or results of operations 
risks related to the run off and to syndicate our self managed run off is subject to a number of risks 
we have placed all of our lines of business in run off with the exception of syndicate running off these businesses includes a number of risks  including the risk that we may not be able to mitigate our existing exposures to our historical underwriting risks  obtain the release of collateral when contracts are cancelled  recover amounts owed to us by our reinsurers and retrocessionaires  enter into commutations  cancellations or other arrangements to mitigate our liabilities  obtain premium that has been due but not paid to us for an extended period of time  release capital from these subsidiaries to our holding company where it is available to our shareholders  reduce our expenses such that they do not exceed income from in vestments  prevent investment losses  maintain sufficient liquidity in each of our subsidiaries to meet the obligations of those subsidiaries 
furthermore  we remain subject to extensive regulation and the risk that regulators may seek to supervise or gain and retain control over our subsidiaries  which would impede our efforts to extract capital from those subsidiaries over time 
in addition  running off these businesses creates substantial uncertainties and risks that may result in restructuring charges and unforeseen expenses and costs 
in addition  as a result of commutations  loss portfolio transfers or other transactions  we may realize gains or losses of assets and liabilities that are different than the amount at which these are currently recorded 
if any of these risks materializes  it may have a material adverse impact on the value of our assets  increase our operating costs or result in liquidity strains 
we may experience unfavorable claims development or receive additional claims as well as delays or failures concerning amounts due from reinsurers or retrocessionaires  which could result in additional losses 
unfavorable claims experience related to the run off of any or all of our lines of business may occur and would result in losses in the future as we still have policies in force that have terms of up to years 
in addition  as required by us generally accepted accounting standards  we have not established reserves for claims that may arise from losses occurring in the future on the policies that remain in force 
further  we have experienced some instances of slower payments from  and disputes about amounts owed to us with  our reinsurers and retrocessionaires 
as a result  we may incur losses attributable to our inability to recover amounts from retrocessionaires or ceding companies either due to disputes with the retrocession aires or ceding companies  their financial condition or both 
if our reserves for amounts recoverable from retrocessionaires or ceding companies  as well as reserves associated with the underlying reinsurance exposures are insufficient  it could result in losses and an increase in cost and management time related to arbitration and other dispute resolution 
our holding company structure and certain regulatory and other constraints  including our credit facility  affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares  return capital  make payments on our indebtedness and other liabilities and our ability to redeem our series a preferred shares 
quanta holdings is a holding company 
as a result  we do not  and will not  have any significant operations or assets other than our ownership of our subsidiaries 
dividends and other permitted distributions from our operating subsidiaries will be our sole source of funds to pay dividends  if any  to shareholders of our common and series a preferred shares  redeem or repurchase any or all of our series a preferred shares and to meet ongoing cash requirements  including debt service payments and other expenses 
for example  we did not pay dividends on the series a preferred shares in the second  third and fourth quarters of and the first quarter of and did not pay interest on our pooled 
table of contents trust preferred securities in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of additionally  as we run off and wind up our businesses we will be seeking  over time and subject to the approval of our regulators  to extract capital from our subsidiaries and dividend it to our holding company where it can be available to our shareholders 
because we are a holding company  our ability to pay dividends on our common and series a preferred shares and to redeem or repurchase any or all of our series a preferred shares for cash is limited by restrictions on our ability to obtain funds through dividends from our subsidiaries 
the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make payments to quanta holdings is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the domiciles in which the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations subject our subsidiaries to significant restrictions and require  among other things  the submission and approval of a withdrawal plan or similar arrangements by regulators  the maintenance by some of our subsidiaries of minimum solvency requirements and the limitation of the amount of dividends that these subsidiaries can pay to us 
in addition  following the withdrawal of our am best rating  the bma  the regulator of one or our principal insurance subsidiaries  quanta bermuda  amended quanta bermuda s license to  amon g other things  restrict it from making any dividend payments to quanta holdings without the prior approval of the bma and to prohibit it from entering into certain transactions 
there are also significant restrictions regarding our ability to remove the funds deposited to support part of the underwriting capacity of syndicate at lloyd s 
the inability of our operating subsidiaries to pay dividends or to return capital in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our cash requirements at the holding company level could have a material adverse effect on our operations and on our ability to pay dividends  redeem or repurchase our series a preferred shares and make payments on our indebtedness 
we anticipate that the paying of dividends or the return of capital to the holding company will require regulatory approval 
we will work  over time  with applicable regulatory authorities to facilitate dividends from our insurance subsidiaries to quanta holdings 
working with these regulators takes time and w ill require us to meet many conditions  especially given that most of our business is in run off 
we are subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares  redeem our series a preferred shares and make other payments 
under the companies act of bermuda  as amended  or the companies act  even though we are solvent and able to pay our liabilities as they become due  we may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution if we have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or will after the payment be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets will thereby be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts 
risks related to any dissolution of our business in the future  it is possible that we could be placed into liquidation either as a solvent entity or as an insolvent entity 
a liquidation as a solvent entity is a voluntary liquidation approved by shareholders 
if we were to become insolvent  we would have to be liquidated under the supervision of the bermuda supreme court during which a court appointed liquidator of our company may or may not pursue a scheme of arrangement to shorten the time otherwise required to wind up our business 
in a winding up or liquidation as described above  we or a liquidator would be appointed and would sell or otherwise dispose of our remaining assets  pay our existing liabilities  including contingent obligations which would have to be estimated in advance of payment and distribute net proceeds  if any  to our shareholders in one or more liquidation distributions 
in a liquidation  we may not receive any material amounts for the sale or other disposition of our assets 
further  in a liquidation  we will have significant obligations  including the costs incurred by the independent liquidator appointed and the work required to estimate liabilities and realize assets 
the amount and timing of distributions  if any  to shareholders in a liquidation cannot be predicted at this time because any distribution would depend on a variety of factors  including the amount of proceeds received from any asset sales or dispositions  the time and amount required to resolve outstanding obligations and the amount of any reserves for future contingencies 
if we were to 
table of contents become insolvent  it is unlikely that there will be distributions payable to our common shareholders 
common shareholders will rank last in order of priority of distribution in a liquidation 
we are dependent on our executives and other key employees to run off our business  to operate our lloyd s business and to identify  evaluate and complete any strategic transaction 
we may not be able to retain our personnel or attract any needed new personnel  which may have a material adverse effect on our company and the execution of our run off plan 
our failure to retain members of our management team  key employees and other personnel and our inability to attract any needed new personnel or to use our existing personnel in new  altered or expanded roles could significantly and negatively affect our ability to conduct our self managed run off  to manage syndicate and to evaluate and complete any strategic transaction 
in order to retain the services of james j 
ritchie  our executive chairman  and jonathan jr dodd  our chief financial officer  and a number of other key employees  we have entered into retention agreements with these employees that provide for specified severance payments in the event of their termination without cause or following a change of control 
h owever  we do not have a retention agreement with peter d 
johnson  our chief executive officer  and he and our other employees who we did not enter into retention agreements with are not restricted from seeking employment with our competitors or others who may seek their expertise 
our reliance on brokers subjects us to their credit risk 
in accordance with industry practice  we frequently pay amounts owed on claims under our insurance or reinsurance contracts to brokers  and these brokers  in turn  are expected to pay these amounts over to the clients that have purchased insurance or reinsurance from us 
if a broker fails to make such a payment in a significant portion of business that we write it is highly likely that we will be liable to the client for the deficiency under local laws or contractual obligations 
likewise  when we are required to return premiums in connection with a cancellation or commutation  the brokers collect these payments from us but these premiums are not considered returned 
accordingly  the policy is not cancelled or commuted and our ris k is not terminated until the broker returns these premiums to the client 
lastly  our reinsurers and retrocessionaires in many cases make payments owed to us to brokers and these brokers  in turn  are expected to pay these amounts to us 
if a broker fails to make such a payment to us  we may be unsuccessful in obtaining payment from the reinsurer or retrocessionaire or we may incur costs in enforcing the payment of amounts owed to us 
consequently  we assume a degree of credit risk associated with brokers around the world with respect to most of our business 
we face significant litigation relating to alleged securities law violations 
two class action lawsuits have been filed against quanta holdings and certain of its officers and directors on behalf of a putative class consisting of investors who purchased our publicly traded series a preferred securities and common shares 
the complaints allege  among other things  that we made false  misleading and incomplete statements regarding loss estimates in violation of the federal securities laws 
it is possible that additional lawsuits relating to these matters may be filed against us and or certain of our current and former officers and directors in the future 
it is also possible that administrative proceedings or regulatory proceedings could be commenced against us in the future 
these lawsuits and any future proceedings could be expensive and could divert management s attention and other resources away from other matters 
any such diversion of management s attention or other resources could negatively and materially impact our self managed run off 
we cannot predict the timing of any trials with respect to these lawsuits and any future proceedings 
we are not currently able to estimate legal defense costs or the amount of any damages that we may be required to pay in connection with these lawsuits and any future proceedings 
the class action lawsuits which could continue for a significant period  are currently at a very early stage and we have very little information as to the course either wi ll take 
in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation  particularly where the claimants seek indeterminate damages  we are unable to predict the outcome of these matters and at this time cannot reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to this lawsuit and any future proceedings 

table of contents we have not established any reserves for any potential liability relating to the class action lawsuits 
we have insurance coverage above a certain self insured retention with respect to claims such as these lawsuits but it is not currently possible to determine whether such insurance coverage will be adequate to cover our defense costs and any losses 
the existence of the class action lawsuits or the perceived probability of future proceedings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common and series a preferred securities 
our business  results of operations and financial condition have been and could continue to be adversely affected by catastrophic events 
although we are no longer writing property reinsurance business that is exposed to catastrophes  certain lines of business that we have underwritten  including marine and aviation reinsurance and environmental  have large aggregate exposures  including to natural and man made disasters such as hurricane  typhoon  windstorm  flood  earthquake  acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability for periods of up to ten years 
additionally  we retain property exposure from our program business 
through the specie and fine arts products of syndicate we also have exposure to natural and man made disasters such as hurricane  typhoon  windstorm  flood  earthquake  acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
our l oss experience generally has and  despite our exit from the property reinsurance and the technical risk property insurance markets  we expect that it will continue to be subject to infrequent events of great severity 
in the future we may recognize additional net losses related to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and other catastrophes 
if our actual losses from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma are materially greater than our estimated losses  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we purchase reinsurance for our insurance and reinsurance operations in order to mitigate the volatility of losses upon our financial results 
based on our current estimate of losses related to hurricanes katrina and rita  we have exhausted our reinsurance and retrocessional protection with respect to hurricane katrina and our marine reinsurance with respect to hurricane rita 
if our hurricane katrina losses prove to be greater than currently anticipated  we have no further reinsurance and retrocessional coverage available for that windstorm 
if our marine reinsurance losses for hurricane rita prove greater than currently anticipated  we will have no further retrocessional coverage available for marine reinsurance losses for that windstorm 
additionally  the occurrence of additional large loss events could reduce the reinsurance coverage that is available to us and could weaken the financial condition of our reinsurers  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
losses from these types of catastrophic events could eliminate our shareholders equity and statutory surplus which is the amount remaining after all liabilities  including loss reserves  are subtracted from all admitted assets  as determined under statutory accounting principles 
increases in the values and geographic concentrations of insured property and the effects of inflation have resulted in increased severity of industry losses in recent years and we expect that those factors will increase the severity of catastrophe losses in the future 
we have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  which could adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations accurately and on a timely basis 
in connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   we have identified material weaknesses in our internal control 
for a discussion of our internal control over financial reporting and a description of these material weaknesses  see item a 
controls and procedures management s report on internal control over financial reporting 
material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information 
as a result  we must continue to develop and implement our remediation plan to address the material weaknesses and to obtain reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial statements 
our resources are constrained and 
table of contents management is required to devote a significant amount of time and resources toward the run off of our specialty insurance and reinsurance businesses  which could delay or otherwise negatively impact implementation of our remediation plan for our internal controls if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following our remediation plan  or fail to update our internal controls as our business changes  we may not be able to timely or accurately report our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows or maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures 
if we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures  we could be subject to  among other things  regulatory or enforcement actions by the sec and nasdaq  including a delisting from nasdaq  and a general loss of investor confidence  any one of which could adversely affect the valuation of our securities 
we are exposed to risks relating to evaluations of controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of we have evaluated our internal controls systems to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to audit  our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have identified control deficiencies of varying degrees of severity under applicable sec and public company accounting oversight board rules and regulations that remain unremediated 
as a public company  we are required to report  among other things  control deficiencies that constitute a material weakness or changes in internal controls that  or are reasonably likely to  materially affect internal controls over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a significant deficiency  o r combination of significant deficiencies that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
the report by us of a material weakness  including the material weaknesses identified in this annual report  may cause investors to lose confidence in our financial statements and our stock price may be adversely affected 
if we fail to remedy any material weakness  our financial statements may be inaccurate and the share price of our common and preferred shares and our business may be adversely affected 
we may be required to post additional security under insurance and reinsurance agreements 
if our actual losses exceed our estimates or as a result of future losses and other events  we may be required to post additional security under some of our insurance and reinsurance contracts either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
if we fail to maintain or enter into adequate letter of credit facilities on a timely basis  we would be required to place securities in trust or similar arrangements  which would be more difficult and costly to establish and administer and could lead to liquidity strains 
if actual claims exceed our loss reserves  our financial results could be significantly adversely affected 
our success depends upon our ability to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that we insure and reinsure 
to the extent actual claims exceed our expectations we will be required to immediately recognize the less favorable experience as we become aware of it 
this could cause a material increase in our liabilities and reduction of capital 
it is early in our history and the number and size of reported claims may increase  and their size could exceed our expectations 
a portion of our business has high attachment points of coverage 
reserving for losses is inherently complicated in that losses in excess of the attachment level of our policies are characterized by high severity and low frequency  and other factors which could vary significantly as claims are settled 
this limits the volume of relevant industry claims experience available from which to reliably predict ultimate losses following a loss event 
in addition  there always exists a reporting lag between a loss event taking place and the reporting of the loss to us 
these incurred but not reported losses are inherently difficult to predict 
because of the variability and uncertainty associated with loss estimation  it is possible that o ur individual case reserves for each catastrophic event and other case reserves are incorrect  possibly materially 

table of contents these factors require us to make significant assumptions when establishing loss reserves 
since we have insufficient past loss experience  we supplement this information with industry data 
this industry data may not match our risk profile  which introduces a further degree of uncertainty into the process 
accordingly  actual claims and claim expenses paid may deviate  perhaps substantially  from the reserve estimates reflected in our financial statements 
in our reinsurance business line  like other reinsurers  we do not separately evaluate each of the individual risks assumed under reinsurance treaties 
therefore  we are largely dependent on the original underwriting decisions made by ceding companies 
we are subject to the risk that the ceding companies may not have adequately evaluated the risks to be reinsured and that the premiums ceded may not adequately compensate us for the risks we assume 
if our loss reserves are determined to be inadequate  we will be required to increase loss reserves at the time of such determination with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is rectified 
it is possible that claims in respect of events that have occurred could exceed our loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or our financial condition in general 
the failure of any of the loss limitation methods we employ could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations 
we have sought to limit our loss exposure by writing a number of our reinsurance contracts on an excess of loss basis  adhering to maximum limitations on reinsurance written in defined geographical zones  limiting program size for each client and by prudent underwriting of each program written 
in the case of proportional treaties  we sought per occurrence limitations or loss ratio caps to limit the impact of losses from any one event 
we cannot be sure that any of these loss limitation methods has been or will be effective 
we also sought to limit our loss exposure by geographic diversification 
we cannot assure you that various provisions of our policies  such as limitations or exclusions from coverage or choice of forum  will b e enforceable in the manner we intended 
disputes relating to coverage and choice of legal forum may also arise 
underwriting is inherently a matter of judgment  involving important assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond our control  and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
as a result  our actual claims could substantially exceed our expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or our results of operations  possibly to the extent of eliminating our shareholders equity 
syndicate competes with a large number of companies in the insurance industry for underwriting revenues 
syndicate competes with a large number of other companies in its current selected lines of business 
these competitors offer the lines of insurance that syndicate offers  target the same markets as syndicate and utilizes similar business strategies 
syndicate faces competition both from specialty insurance companies  underwriting agencies and intermediaries  as well as diversified financial services companies 
since syndicate has a limited operating history  many of its competitors have greater name and brand recognition 
many of them also have more in many cases substantially more capital and greater marketing and management resources than syndicate has and may offer a broader range of products and more competitive pricing than we expect to  or will be able to  offer 
syndicate s competitive position is based on many factors  including its perceived financial strength  geographic scope of business  client relationships  premiums charged  contract terms and conditions  products and services offered including the ability to design customized programs  speed of claims payment  reputation  experience and qualifications of employees and local presence 
if competition limits its ability to write new and renewal business at adequate rates  our return on capital may be adversely affected 
restructuring of syndicate may not be successful 
although the am best a excellent rated lloyd s market  including syndicate  was not subject to our rating actions  they did negatively impact our lloyd s operations during the year 
table of contents ended december  although we have restructured our lloyd s operations and we continue to work to diversify the provision of capital to the syndicate to support its presence in the lloyd s market  we cannot assure you that these efforts will be successful 
if these efforts are unsuccessful  our lloyd s segment operations could be adversely affected and our ability to obtain the return of our capital in syndicate could be delayed 
we may misevaluate the risks we seek to insure in the underwriting and pricing of our products in syndicate if syndicate misevaluates these risks  its actual incurred losses may be greater than its loss reserves  which would negatively impact its business and reputation and would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operation 
the market for syndicate s specialty lines insurance products differs significantly from the standard market 
in general  in the standard market  insurance rates and forms are highly regulated  products and coverages are largely uniform and have relatively predictable exposures and companies tend to compete for customers on the basis of price and service 
in contrast  the specialty market  including the lloyd s market in which syndicate operates  provides coverage for risks that do not fit the underwriting criteria of the standard carriers 
syndicate has a team of experienced underwriting officers and underwriters with specialized knowledge of their respective market segments 
its success will depend on the ability of these underwriters to accurately assess the risks associated with the businesses that it ensures 
underwriting for specialty lines products requires syndicate to make assumptions about matters that are inherently unpredictable and beyond its control and for which historical experience and probability analysis may not provide sufficient guidance 
further  underwriting for specialty lines presents particular difficulties because there is usually limited information available on the client s loss history for the perils being insured 
if syndicate fails to adequately evaluate the risks to be insured  its business and reputation and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
significant periods of time often elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to an insurer and payment by the insurer of that loss 
as we recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we will continue to establish reserves 
these reserves represent estimates of amounts needed to pay reported losses and unreported losses and the related loss adjustment expense 
loss reserves are only an estimate of what an insurer anticipates the ultimate costs of claims to be and do not represent an exact calculation of liability 
estimating loss reserves is a difficult and complex process involving many variables and subjective judgments  particularly for new companies  such as ours  that have limited loss development experience 
as part of our reserving process  we review historical data as well as actuarial and statistical projections and consider the impact of various factors such as

changes in the regulatory and litigation environments 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  and actual results are likely to differ from original estimates 
in addition  unforeseen losses  the type or magnitude of which we cannot predict  may emerge in the future 
to the extent our loss reserves are insufficient to cover actual losses or loss adjustment expenses  we will have to add to these loss reserves and incur a charge to our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our utilization of program managers and other third parties to support our business exposes us to operational and financial risks 
in our program product line  we relied on program managers  and other agents and brokers participating in our programs  to produce and service a substantial portion of our business in this 
table of contents segment 
in these arrangements  we typically granted the program manager the right to bind us to newly issued insurance policies  subject to underwriting guidelines we provided and other contractual restrictions and obligations 
should our managers have issued policies that contravene these guidelines  restrictions or obligations  we could nonetheless be deemed liable for these policies 
we aim to resist claims that exceed or expand on our underwriting intention  however  it is possible that we would not prevail in such an action  or that our program managers would be unable to substantially indemnify us for their contractual breach 
we also relied on our managers  or other third parties we retained  to collect premiums and to pay valid claims 
while we strive to mitigate these risks through our contractual arrangement with the program managers and other third parties  we remain exposed to these credit and operational risks  without necessarily relieving us of our obligations to potential insureds 
we could also be exposed to potential liabilities relating to the claims practices of the third party administrators we have retained to manage claims activity that we expect to arise in our program operations 
although we have implemented auditing and other oversight protocols for our program  we cannot assure you that these measures will be sufficient to alleviate all of these exposures 
assessments and other surcharges for guaranty funds and similar arrangements may have a negative impact on our financial condition 
virtually all states in the us require insurers licensed to do business therein to bear a portion of the unfunded obligations of impaired or insolvent insurance companies 
these obligations are funded by assessments  which are levied by guaranty associations or similar entities within the state  up to prescribed limits  on all member insurers in the state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by member insurers in the lines of business in which the impaired  insolvent or failed insurer was engaged during the period in which the member insurer was engaged in those lines of business 
accordingly  we may be assessed in the future on a portion of premiums we wrote before we commenced our self managed run of f 
the effect of these assessments and arrangements  or changes in them  could have a negative impact on our financial condition in any given period 
continued or increased levies by lloyd s for the lloyd s central fund and cash calls for trust fund deposits or a significant downgrade of lloyd s am best rating would materially and adversely affect us 
we participate in lloyd s through syndicate whenever any member of lloyd s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders or to meet certain other obligations  these debts or obligations may be payable by the lloyd s central fund 
the lloyd s central fund protects lloyd s policyholders against the failure of a member of lloyd s to meet its obligations 
the central fund is a mechanism that  in effect  mutualizes unpaid liabilities among all members  whether individual or corporate 
the fund is available to back lloyd s policies issued after lloyd s requires members to contribute to the central fund in the form of an annual contribution and by making  through the syndicates on which they participate  annual subordinated loans to lloyd s whose proceeds are held in the central fund 
the council of lloyd s has discretion to require members to make further central fund contributions of up to of their underwriting capacity in any one year 
policies issued in syndicate years that have not been closed before have been reinsured by equitas  an independent insurance company authorized by the financial services authority  or fsa 
however  if equitas were to fail or otherwise be unable to meet all of its obligations  lloyd s may take the view that it is appropriate to apply the central fund to discharge those liabilities equitas failed to meet 
in that case  the council of lloyd s may resolve to impose a special or additional levy on the existing members  including corporate members such as quanta  effectively requiring them to fund the performance of those obligations 
additionally  lloyd s insurance and reinsurance business is subject to local regulation 
regulators in the united states require lloyd s to maintain certain minimum deposits in trust funds as protection for policyholders in the united states 
these deposits may be used to cover liabilities in the event of a major claim arising in the united states and lloyd s may require quanta limited to satisfy cash calls to meet claims payment obligations and to maintain minimum trust fund amounts 

table of contents any premium levy or cash call would increase the expenses of syndicate and quanta  its corporate member  without providing compensating revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our results 
the lloyd s market is currently rated a excellent by am best 
in the event that lloyd s rating is downgraded below a in the future  the downgrade could have a material adverse effect on our ability to underwrite business through syndicate and on our financial condition or results of operations 
the availability of reinsurance and retrocessional coverage that we use to limit our exposure to risks may be limited  and counterparty credit and other risks associated with our reinsurance arrangements may result in losses which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
to limit our risk of loss and to mitigate the volatility of losses upon our financial results  we used reinsurance and retrocessional coverage  which is reinsurance of a reinsurer s business 
the availability and cost of reinsurance and retrocessional protection is subject to market conditions  which are beyond our control 
currently  there is a high level of demand for these arrangements 
the occurrence of additional large loss events could reduce the reinsurance coverage that is available to us and could weaken the financial condition of our reinsurers which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to renew adequate protection at cost effective levels in t he future 
as a result of market conditions and other factors  we may not be able to successfully alleviate risk through reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements 
further  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance and retrocessional arrangements because the ceding of risk to reinsurers and retrocessionaires will not relieve us of our liability to the clients or companies we insure or reinsure 
our failure to establish adequate reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements  our failure to cause reinsurers or retrocessionaires or meet their obligations to us or the failure of our reinsurance or retrocessional arrangements to protect us from overly concentrated risk exposure could adversely affect our business  financial con dition and results of operations 
we could face unanticipated losses from war  terrorism and political unrest  and these or other unanticipated losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may have exposure to unexpected losses resulting from future man made catastrophic events  such as acts of war  acts of terrorism and political instability 
although we may attempt to exclude losses from terrorism and certain other similar risks from some coverages we write  we may not be successful in doing so 
in addition  we have written policies explicitly limiting the exposure of our clients to the credit worthiness of their commercial trade partners in some emerging markets or to political uncertainty in those countries which could interfere with the execution of commercial contracts they have entered into 
these risks are inherently unpredictable and may increase the frequency or severity of losses 
it is difficult to pr edict the timing of such events or to estimate the amount of loss that any given occurrence will generate 
to the extent that losses from such risks occur  our financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 
we must continue to develop  implement and integrate new software and systems 
our software systems are not fully developed  implemented or integrated 
we continue to rely on many manual processes  which have an increased risk of errors and require more controls than we expect to need once our systems are fully developed  implemented and integrated 
a defect or failure in our controls could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
while we have acquired new software and systems responsible for accounting  claims management  modeling and other tasks  we must continue to implement and integrate these software and systems with each other and with those that we are developing ourselves 
in addition  we must acquire or obtain the right to use additional software and systems and continue to develop t hose systems as well as any systems that we are creating internally 
our failure to acquire  implement or integrate our systems in a timely and effective manner could impede our ability to execute our run off plan 
this failure could significantly and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we rely on our information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process claims  commutations and cancellations  to facilitate collections and to monitor our investment portfolio 
these systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions 
we believe our technology and telecommunications systems are critical to our business and our ability to compete successfully 
the failure of these systems  or the termination of a third party software license upon which any of these systems is based  could interrupt our operations 
because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we cannot be certain that we will have continued access to these third party systems and we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
in addition  we cannot make any assurances that our systems will continue to operate as intended 
if sustained or repeated  a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner 
this could result in a material adverse effect on our business 
our business could be adversely affected by bermuda employment restrictions 
we have hired and may continue to hire a number of non bermudians to work for us in bermuda 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a bermudian or a holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holder of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
the bermuda government recently announced a new policy limiting the duration of work permits to six years  wi th certain exemptions for key employees 
while we have been able to obtain work permits that we have needed for our employees to date  we can not assure you that we will not encounter difficulties in the future 
we may not be able to use the services of one or more of our key employees if we are not able to obtain work permits for them  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a significant amount of our invested assets is subject to market volatility 
we invest the premiums we received from customers 
our investment portfolio currently contains highly rated and liquid fixed income securities 
our investment portfolio is invested by several professional investment advisory management firms under the direction of our management team in accordance with our investment guidelines and are subject to market wide risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
the volatility of our claims may force us to liquidate securities 
the obligations under the credit facility are currently fully secured by investments and cash 
if a default occurs under the credit agreement  our lenders may require us to cash collateralize a portion or all of the outstanding lette rs of credit issued under the facility  which may be accomplished through the substitution or liquidation of collateral 
these events may cause us to incur capital losses 
our investment results and  therefore  our financial condition may also be impacted by changes in the business  financial condition or results of operations of the entities in which we invest  as well as changes in interest rates  government monetary policies  general economic conditions and overall market conditions 
further  if we do not structure our investment portfolio so that it is appropriately matched with our insurance and reinsurance liabilities  we may be forced to liquidate investments prior to maturity at a significant loss to cover such liabilities 
investment losses could significantly decrease our asset base  which will affect our ability to conduct business 
we may be adversely affected by interest rate changes 
our investment portfolio contains interest rate sensitive instruments  such as bonds  which may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
because of the unpredictable nature of losses that may 
table of contents arise under insurance and reinsurance policies  we expect our liquidity needs will be substantial and may arise at any time 
increases in interest rates during periods when we sell investments to satisfy liquidity needs may result in losses 
changes in interest rates could also have an adverse effect on our investment income and results of operations 
for example  if interest rates decline  reinvested funds will earn less than expected 
in addition  our investment portfolio includes highly rated mortgage backed securities 
as with other fixed income investments  the fair market value of these securities fluctuates depending on market and other general economic conditions and the interest rate environment 
changes in interest rates can expose us to prepayment risks on these investments 
in periods of declining interest rates  mortgage prepayments generally increase and mortgage backed securities are prepaid more quickly  requiring us to reinvest the proceeds at the then current market rates 
in periods of increasing interest rates  these investments are exposed to extension risk  which occurs when the holders of underlying mortgages reduce the frequency on which t hey prepay the outstanding principal before the maturity date and delay any refinancing of the outstanding principal 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we attempt to take measures to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our mitigation efforts include maintaining a high quality portfolio with a relatively short duration to reduce the effect of interest rate changes on book value 
despite our mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our book value 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to experience losses 
our functional currency is the us dollar 
our operating currency generally is also the us dollar 
however  the premiums receivable and losses payable in respect of a portion of our business is denominated in currencies of other countries 
for example  syndicate operates in pounds sterling 
we attempt to manage our foreign currency risk by seeking to match our liabilities under insurance and reinsurance policies that are payable in foreign currencies either with forward purchase contracts or with investments that are denominated in these currencies 
to the extent we believe that it may be practical  we hedge our foreign currency exposure with respect to potential losses by maintaining assets denominated in the same currency or entering into forward purchase contracts for specific currencies 
we use forward purchase contracts when we are advised of known or probable significant losses that will be paid in non us currencies in order to manage currency fluctuation exposure 
we also use forward purchase contracts to hedge our non us dollar currency exposure with respect to premiums receivable  which will be generally collected over the relevant contract term to the extent practical and to the extent we do not expect we will need these receipts to fund potential losses in such currencies 
we also make foreign currency denominated investments  generally for the purpose of improving overall portfolio yield 
however  we may not be successful in reducing foreign currency exchange risks 
as a result  we may from time to time experience losses resulting from fluctuations in values of foreign currencies  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our returns may be adversely impacted by inflation 
the effects of inflation could cause the severity of claims to rise in the future 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses will include assumptions about future payments for settlement of claims and claims handling expenses  such as medical treatments and litigation costs 
to the extent inflation causes these costs to increase above reserves established for these costs  we would be required to increase our loss reserves with a corresponding reduction in our net income in the period in which the deficiency is identified 
our liability transfer program may expose us to liability 
we have created two liability assumption programs under which a special purpose entity assumes specified liabilities associated with environmental exposures 
our liability assumption program requires 
table of contents extensive technical skills and judgments in order to evaluate the significant risks associated with the properties subject to the program 
we are exposed to substantial liabilities related to the environmental conditions associated with assuming liabilities with respect to these properties that could materially adversely affect our financial position 
we are subject to extensive regulation in bermuda  the united states  ireland and lloyd s  which may adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives in syndicate and our run off objectives 
if we do not comply with these regulations  we may be subject to penalties  including fines  suspensions and withdrawals of licenses  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation and supervision and to the regulation and supervision of lloyd s with respect to syndicate most insurance regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than shareholders and other investors

regulation in the united states 
in recent years  the state insurance regulatory framework in the united states has come under increased federal scrutiny  and some state legislators have considered or enacted laws that may alter or increase state authority to regulate insurance companies and insurance holding companies 
moreover  the national association of insurance commissioners  which is an association of the insurance regulatory officials of all states and the district of columbia  and state insurance regulators regularly reexamine existing laws and regulations  interpretations of existing laws and the development of new laws 
in addition  surplus lines associations in various states are asserting themselves more aggressively

regulation in lloyd s 
the business of syndicate is subject to regulation by the financial services authority  as established by the financial services and markets act  through its regulation of the managing agent of the syndicate and its regulation of the society of lloyd s itself 
under this act  the financial services authority has broad powers of intervention 
the financial services authority requires that the managing agent of the syndicate carry out a capital assessment of the syndicate in order to determine whether any additional capital should be held by the syndicate on account of any particular risks arising from its business or operational infrastructure 
this assessment known as an individual capital assessment is reviewed and may be challenged by lloyd s

the impact of bermuda s letter of commitment to the organization for economic cooperation and development to eliminate harmful tax practices is uncertain and could adversely affect our tax status in bermuda 
a number of multinational organizations  including the european union  the financial action task force  the financial stability forum  and the organization for economic cooperation and development  which is commonly referred to as the oecd  have published reports and launched a global dialogue among member and non member countries on measures to limit harmful tax competition 
these measures are largely directed at counteracting the effects of tax havens and preferential tax regimes in countries around the world 
tax haven jurisdictions that do not cooperate with the oecd could face sanctions imposed by oecd member countries 
in the oecd s report dated june   bermuda was not listed as a tax haven jurisdiction because it had previously signed a letter committing itself to eliminate harmful tax practices by the end of and to embrace international tax standards for transparency  exchange of information and the elimination of any aspects of the regimes for financial and other services that attract business with no substantial

given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  risks related to the industry the insurance business is historically cyclical  and we expect to experience periods with excess underwriting capacity and unfavorable premium rates at syndicate historically  insurers have experienced significant fluctuations in operating results due to competition  frequency of occurrence or severity of catastrophic and other loss events  levels of capacity  general economic and social conditions and other factors 
the supply of insurance is related to prevailing prices  the level of insured losses and the level of industry surplus which  in turn  may fluctuate in response to changes in rates of return on investments being earned in the insurance industry 
as a result  the insurance business historically has been a cyclical industry characterized by periods of intense price competition due to excessive underwriting capacity as well as periods when shortages of capacity permitted favorabl e premium levels 
the supply of insurance may increase  either due to capital provided by new entrants or by the commitment of additional capital by existing insurers  which may cause prices to decrease 
any of these factors could lead to a significant reduction in premium rates  less favorable policy terms and fewer submissions for our underwriting services at syndicate in addition to these considerations  changes in the frequency and severity of losses suffered by insureds may affect the cycles of the insurance business significantly 
we expect that the returns on our investment in syndicate will be impacted by the cyclical nature of the insurance industry 
the existence of negative market conditions may affect our ability to write insurance at rates that we consider appropriate relative to the risk assumed 
if we cannot write our specialty lines of insurance at syndicate at appropriate rates  our ability to transact our business in the lloyd s market would be significantly and advers ely affected 
the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the run off of our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have issued insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under our insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract is issued

terrorism legislation may negatively affect the results of operation and business of syndicate the terrorism risk insurance act of  or tria  was enacted by the us congress and became effective in november in response to the tightening of supply in some insurance markets resulting from  among other things  the terrorist attacks of september  tria generally requires us property and casualty insurers  including syndicate s policies issued in the us to offer terrorism coverage for certified acts of terrorism to their policyholders at the same limits and terms as for other coverages 
exclusions or sub limited coverage may be established  but solely at the policyholder s discretion 
the us treasury has the power to extend the application of tria to our non us insurance operating subsi diaries as well 
tria created a temporary federal reinsurance program to reduce us insurers risk of financial loss from certified acts of terrorism 
tria s requirement to offer coverage  as well as the federal reinsurance program  has been extended and is now scheduled to expire on december  while federal reinsurance is available  coverage under the federal reinsurance program is limited

provisions in our charter documents may reduce or increase the voting power associated with our shares 
our bye laws generally provide that common shareholders have one vote for each common share held by them and are entitled to vote  on a non cumulative basis  at all meetings of shareholders 
our certificate of designation generally provides that the holders of our series a preferred shares do not have any voting rights unless dividends on the series a preferred shares have not been declared by the board of directors and paid for an aggregate of six full dividend periods whether or not consecutive 
pursuant to a mechanism specified in our bye laws and certificate of designation  the voting rights exercisable by a shareholder may be limited so that certain persons or groups are not deemed to hold more than of the voting power conferred by our shares 
in addition  our board of directors retains certain discretion to make adjustments to the aggregate number of votes attaching to the shares of any shareholder that they consider fair and reasonable in all the circumstances to ensure that no person will hold more than of the voting power represented by our then outstanding shares 
under these provisions  some shareholders may have the right to exercise their voting rights limited to less than one vote per share

interested director transactions 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  any transaction entered into by us in which a director has an interest is not voidable by us nor can such director be accountable to us for any benefit realized under that transaction provided the nature of the interest is disclosed at the first opportunity at a meeting of directors  or in writing to the directors 
in addition  our bye laws allow a director to be taken into account in determining whether a quorum is present and to vote on a transaction in which he has an interest following a declaration of the interest pursuant to the companies act unless the chairman of the meeting determines otherwise 
us companies are generally required to obtain the approval of a majority of disinterested directors or the approval of shareholders before entering into any transaction or arrangement in which any of their directors have an interest  unless the transaction or arrangement is fair to the company at the time it is authorized by the company s board or shareholders

certain transactions with significant shareholders 
as a bermuda company  we may enter into certain business transactions with our significant shareholders  including asset sales  in which a significant shareholder receives  or could receive  a financial benefit that is greater than that received  or to be received  by other shareholders 
such transactions may be entered into with prior approval from our board of directors but without obtaining prior approval from our shareholders 
us companies in general may not enter into business combinations with interested shareholders  namely certain large shareholders and affiliates  unless the business combination had been approved by the board in advance or by a supermajority of shareholders or the busi ness combination meets specified conditions

shareholders suits 
the rights of shareholders under bermuda law are not as extensive as the rights of shareholders under legislation or judicial precedent in many us jurisdictions 
class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under the laws of bermuda 
in general  under bermuda law  derivative actions are permitted only when the act complained of is alleged to be beyond the corporate power of the company  is illegal or would result in the violation of the company s memorandum of association or bye laws 
in addition  bermuda courts would consider permitting a derivative action for acts that are alleged to constitute a fraud against the minority shareholders or  for instance  acts that require the approval of a greater percentage of the company s shareholders than those who actually approved them

indemnification of directors and officers 
under bermuda law and our bye laws  we may indemnify our directors  officers or any other person appointed to a committee of the board of directors and their respective heirs  executors or administrators to the full extent permitted by law against all actions  costs  charges  liabilities  loss  damage or expense incurred or suffered by such person by reason of any act done  concurred in or omitted in the conduct of our business or in the discharge of his her duties  provided that such indemnification shall not extend to any matter involving any fraud or dishonesty as determined in a final judgment or decree not subject to appeal on the part of such director  officer or other person 
under our bye laws  each of our shareholders agrees to waive any claim or right of action  other than those involving fraud or dishonesty  against us or any of our officers or directors 
in general  us companies may limit the personal liability of their directors as long as they acted in good faith and without knowing violation of law 
as a result of these differences  us persons who own our shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than us persons who own shares of a us corporation 
we are a bermuda company and it may be difficult for you to enforce judgments against us or our directors and executive officers 
we are incorporated under the laws of bermuda and our business is based in bermuda 
in addition  some of our officers reside outside the united states  and all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these persons are  and will continue to be  located in jurisdictions outside the united states 
as such  it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the united states upon us or those persons or to recover against us or them on judgments of us courts  including judgments predicated upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers in the first instance for violation of us federal securi ties laws because these laws have no extraterritorial jurisdiction under bermuda law and do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we have been advised that there is doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or original actions brought in bermuda against us or these persons predicated solely upon us federal securities laws 
further  we have been advised that there is no treaty in effect between the united states and bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of us courts  and there are grounds upon which bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of us courts 
some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including some remedies available under the u 
s 
federal securities laws  may not be allowed in bermuda courts as contrary to that jurisdiction s public policy 
because judgments of us courts are not automatically enforceable in bermuda  it may be difficult for you to recover against us based upon such judgments 

table of contents holders of our shares who own or more of our voting power may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation  or cfc  rules 
each us shareholder of a foreign corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  and that owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the cfc s taxable year  must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart income is not distributed 
a foreign corporation is considered a cfc if us shareholders own more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of voting stock of the foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of the c orporation 
a us shareholder is a us person  as defined in the internal revenue code  that owns at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation 
a cfc also includes a foreign corporation in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned by us shareholders  on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts generating subpart f income exceeds specified limits 
for purposes of determining whether a corporation is a cfc  and therefore whether the more than or more than  in the case of insurance income and ownership tests have been satisfied  shares owned includes shares owned directly or indirectly through foreign entities or shares considered owned under constructive ownership rules 
the attribution rules are complicated and depend on the particular facts relating to each investor 
furthermore  whenever dividends on our series a preferred shares and the parity stock then outstanding have not been declared by the board of directors and paid for an aggregate of at least six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  holders would be entitled to certain voting rights 
it is possible that the internal revenue service  or the irs  could assert that accrual of these voting rights on default of the series a preferred shares cause certain us holders of series a preferred shares to be us shareholders and us  or any of our foreign subsidiaries  to be a cfc 
due to the anticipated dispersion of our share ownership and certain bye law provisions that impose limitations on the concentration of voting power of its shares and that authorize the board to purchase its shares under specified circumstances  we do not believe that we have any us shareholders 
it is possible  however that the irs could challenge the effectiveness of these provisions and that a court could sustain such a challenge 
if we determine that your ownership of our shares may result in adverse consequences  we may require you to sell your shares to us 
our bye laws provide that we have the option  but not the obligation  to require a shareholder to sell its shares at a purchase price equal to their fair market value to us  to other shareholders or to third parties if our board of directors in its absolute discretion determines that the share ownership of that shareholder may result in adverse tax consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any other shareholder 
to the extent possible under the circumstances  the board of directors will use its best efforts to exercise this option equally among similarly situated shareholders 
our right to require a shareholder to sell its shares to us will be limited to the purchase of a number of shares that we determine is necessary to avo id or cure those adverse tax consequences 
us persons who hold shares could be subject to adverse tax consequences if we are considered a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes 
we do not intend to conduct our activities in a manner that would cause us to become a passive foreign investment company 
however  it is possible that we could be deemed a passive foreign investment company by the irs for any prior or future year 
if we were considered a passive foreign investment company it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a greater tax liability than might otherwise apply or subjecting the investor to tax on amounts in advance of when tax would otherwise be imposed 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the passive foreign 
table of contents investment company provisions to an insurance company 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying these rules may be issued in the future 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  this guidance would have on a shareholder that is subject to us federal income taxation 
we have not sought and do not intend to seek an opinion of legal counsel as to whether or not we were a passive foreign investment company for any period 
us persons who hold shares may be subject to us income taxation on their pro rata share of our related party insurance income

us persons are considered to own in the aggregate or more of the stock of either corporation by vote or value  then a us person who owns shares of quanta holdings directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in its income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of quanta europe s or quanta bermuda s related party insurance income for the us person s taxable year that includes the end of the corporation s taxable year determined as if such related party insurance income were distributed proportionately to such us shareholders at that date regardless of whether such income is distributed 
in addition any related party insurance income that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization will be tr eated as unrelated business taxable income 
the amount of related party insurance income earned by quanta europe or quanta bermuda generally  premium and related investment income from the direct or indirect insurance or reinsurance of any direct or indirect us shareholder of quanta europe or quanta bermuda or any person related to such shareholder will depend on a number of factors  including the geographic distribution of quanta europe s or quanta bermuda s business and the identity of persons directly or indirectly insured or reinsured by quanta europe or quanta bermuda 
although we do not expect our related party insurance income to exceed of our gross insurance income in the foreseeable future  some of the factors which determine the extent of related party insurance income in any period may be beyond quanta europe s or quanta bermuda s control 
consequently  quanta europe s or quanta bermuda s related party insurance income could equal or exceed of its gr oss insurance income in any taxable year and ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons could equal or exceed the threshold described above 
the related party insurance income rules provide that if a shareholder that is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance corporation that has related party insurance income even if the amount of related party insurance income is less than of the corporation s gross insurance income or the ownership of its shares by direct or indirect insureds and related persons is less than the threshold and in which us persons own or more of the shares  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not such earnings and profits are attributable to related party insurance income 
in addition  such a shareholder will be required to comply with reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of our shares because quanta holdings will not itself be directly engaged in the insurance business and because proposed us treasury regulations appear to apply only in the case of shares of corporations that are directly engaged in the insurance business 
however  the irs might interpret the proposed regulations in a different manner and the applicable proposed regulations may be promulgated in final form in a manner that would cause these rules to apply to dispositions of our shares 

table of contents changes in us federal income tax law could materially adversely affect an investment in our shares 
the us federal income tax laws and interpretations regarding whether a company is engaged in a trade or business within the united states  or is a passive foreign investment company or whether us persons would be required to include in their gross income the subpart f income or the related party insurance income of a cfc are subject to change  possibly on a retroactive basis 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the passive foreign investment company rules to insurance companies and the regulations regarding related party insurance income are still in proposed form 
new regulations or pronouncements interpreting or clarifying such rules may be issued in the future 
we cannot be certain if  when or in what form such regulations or pronouncements may be provided and whether such regulations or guidance will have a retroactive effect

risk factors in this annual report 
overview general quanta holdings was incorporated on may  as a bermuda holding company formed to provide specialty lines insurance  reinsurance  risk assessment and risk technical services on a global basis through its affiliated companies 
since the beginning of  we have participated in the lloyd s market  which is rated a by am best  through syndicate from the beginning of until the second half of we mainly provided specialty lines insurance and reinsurance services on a global basis and to a lesser extent risk assessment and risk technical services 
following am best s rating action in the first quarter of in the wake of losses from the hurricanes and subsequent decisions by our board of directors after a review of strategic alternatives  we substantially ceased writing new business and began conducting a self managed run off of our remaining insurance and reinsurance businesses with the exception of our business at lloyd s which is more fully described below 
following our decision to place our remaining insurance and reinsurance business other than our lloyd s business in run off  we have achieved the following  all of which are more fully described throughout this annual report

table of contents the specialty insurance and reinsurance business that is subject to our self managed run off is still exposed to new losses on unexpired policies and adverse development on recorded loss and loss expense reserves 
during the run off we will continue to pay losses as they fall due and collect outstanding loss and loss expenses recoverable from our reinsurers 
as we continue to run off and wind up our businesses we will be seeking  over time and subject to the approval of our regulators  to extract capital from our subsidiaries and dividend it or return it as capital to our holding company where it may be available to our stakeholders 
we believe that important factors that have a direct impact on the amount of capital that may ultimately be available to our stakeholders and the timing of when it will be available include our ability to determine which portion of our business to maintain  commute  cancel  transfer  or otherwise mitigate  as the case may be  mitigate exposures to our capital by purchasing additional reinsurance  make available sufficient assets to facilitate distributions from our subsidiaries  invest our assets in a way that balances risk with return and that is adequately matched with the expected payment periods of our obligations  reduce our expenses  manage our claims and collect premiums receivable and losses recove rable  achieve the release of cash and investment encumbrances relating to reinsurance deposits and other security requirements  manage our capital structure and obtain the approval of our regulators to extract capital from our subsidiaries and distribute it to quanta holdings 
this process will take a long period of time and require us to meet many conditions 
we have engaged our regulators and have begun this process 
to the extent any capital is released from our subsidiaries in the future  our board of directors will determine when and how much of those funds will be made available to our stakeholders 
summary of our financial position as at december   our cash and invested assets  which were invested in instruments with an average rating of aa  totaled million 
of these assets  a total of million were restricted  or pledged  under letters of credit or trusts established for the benefit of our clients and approximately million were unrestricted 
we continue to seek ways to reduce these restrictions and encumbrances including through commutations  cancellations and transfers and negotiations with our clients as well as through claim payments and obtaining recoveries from our reinsurers 
as of march   our unrestricted cash and invested assets had increased resulting in consolidated unrestricted cash and invested assets in our operating subsidiaries of approximately million 
our total gross loss reserves were million at december  as compared to million at december  this increase primarily reflects our estimates for incurred losses related to premiums earned during and the growth in our lloyd s business  offset by contract commutations  cancellations and expirations  and our claims paid during the year 
the reserves represent obligations with short and long term duration 
we believe that our shorter term obligations include reinsurance property  reinsurance marine  fidelity  technical risk property  surety and portions of our program business  including the property component of hbw 
the total gross loss and loss expense reserves associated with these lines we re approximately million at december  we believe that our longer term obligations include reinsurance casualty  professional  environmental  the warranty and the contractors general liability portions of our hbw program and our lloyd s business 
the total gross loss and loss expense reserves associated with these lines were approximately million at december  the actual period over which we will pay losses for both of our short and long term business could significantly vary from our expectations given the immaturity of our business and our limited claims paying history and run off status 
we estimate that over of our total gross loss and loss expense reserves are recorded as incurred but not reported reserves  or ibnr  and there can be no certainty as to when these ibnr amounts may become reported  and ultimately  paid losses 
furthermore  our loss and loss expense reserves may change significantly in future periods as we seek to commute  cancel or otherwise t ransfer our insurance and reinsurance contracts 
during the year ended december   we recognized adverse net loss and loss expense development of million related to the hurricanes 
net of reinstatement premiums this adverse development was million 
furthermore  we increased our estimate of loss and loss 
table of contents expenses  net of reinsurance  relating to the rupture of an oil pipeline in california during a mudslide that occurred in the first quarter by million during  net of reinsurance  including approximately million of additional loss expense that was recorded during the fourth quarter of in addition  we incurred net losses of million related to the tornadoes that occurred in the first quarter of we may continue to incur losses from these as well as other historical events  including from policies that have been cancelled 
additionally  our remaining policies continue to be subject to risk of new losses from future catastrophes and other events 
we will continue to seek and mitigate these exposures through policy cancellations  commutations and transfers along with the purchase of reinsurance protection for future catastrophes if it is available on terms that are acceptable to us 
based on our current estimate of losses related to hurricane katrina  we have exhausted our reins urance and retrocessional protection with respect to that hurricane 
if our hurricane katrina losses and our marine reinsurance losses with respect to hurricane rita prove to be greater than currently anticipated  we will have no further reinsurance and retrocessional coverage available for those windstorms 
offsetting these losses and loss developments during we recorded approximately million of net favorable loss development on our loss and loss expense reserves recorded at december  in several of our product lines related to more mature accident periods in which actual loss experience was better than expected 
with respect to our remaining policies with current and future exposure periods  our gross unearned premium reserves were approximately million at december  some of these policies have exposure periods that extend beyond one year 
we believe that approximately of our gross unearned premium reserves will be earned within one year 
the balance will be earned after one year over the remaining term of the underlying exposure periods which can be up to years 
in the first quarter of we purchased quota share reinsurance for future losses that may occur in our technical risk property product line from natural peril or catastrophe or accidental events 
this reinsurance purchase resulted in approximately million in ceded premium in the first quarter of  and we believe that this significantly reduces our future net loss exposure from these events 
we continue to seek to reduce these exposure periods through policy commutation  cancellation and loss portfolio transfers and  where appropriate  through the purchase of reinsurance protection 
as of december   our total capital was approximately million  including our junior subordinate debentures and our redeemable preferred shares 
this capital is subject to regulation in the following jurisdictions approximately million in bermuda  approximately million in the uk lloyd s and the financial services authority  approximately million in the united states mainly in colorado and in indiana  and approximately million in the european union unrelated to lloyd s and subject to the jurisdiction of the irish financial services regulatory authority 
the balance of our capital of approximately million is held in our other non insurance regulated subsidiaries 
our lloyd s business during  our business in syndicate continued to operate in the a rated lloyd s market 
on march   we restructured our investment in syndicate by committing to support of the syndicate s capital requirements and by attracting the remaining commitment of of that capital requirement from chaucer plc  a third party 
we also established pembroke managing agency to act as the managing agent for syndicate while we own of pembroke managing agency  the majority is owned by chaucer and the senior management of syndicate we believe that this structure aligns management with the interest of the capital providers of syndicate we intend to continue to seek third party capital for syndicate our lloyd s segment recorded million and million in gross and net written premiums in the year ended december  as compared to million and million in gross and net written premiums in the year ended december  the syndicate generated net earned premium of million and million in the years ended december  and its net loss ratio was and in and we believe that the levels of gross premium written and earned in syndicate were lower than expected in as a result of the uncertainty following our am best downgrade and the subsequent decision to engage in a self managed run off of our other 
table of contents businesses 
the restructuring of our investment in syndicate and the commitment of third party capital to syndicate is intended to address these issues and allow syndicate to focus on implementing its business plan 
the net loss ratio of syndicate was higher than expected due to the impact of minimum premium requirements that we have on excess of loss reinsurance contracts for this business 
we purchased this reinsurance for our lloyd s business before the am best downgrade when our expectations for the amount of gross premium the lloyd s segment would be able to write during were more robust 
the excess of loss reinsurance contract requires us to cede minimum fixed amounts of our premium  regardless of the amount of gross premium written in syndicate consequently the proportion of written premium ceded to reinsurers was higher than planned and that had a direct impact on our net earned premium 
as a result our net losses were higher than planned when express ed as a proportion of our earned premium  net of earned ceded reinsurance premiums 
our results our net loss to common shareholders was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  our results were impacted primarily by the am best downgrade and our decision to engage in a self managed run off in all our business lines other than our lloyd s business 
as a result  we received significantly lower revenues from premiums earned and had significantly higher costs related to employee severance  professional  legal and advisory fees 
our results were also impacted to a lesser extent by adverse reserve developments on hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma  the oil pipeline claim referred to above and other than temporary impairment charges on o ur invested assets 
in  we generated approximately million of net premiums written  including million from syndicate  after premiums ceded on purchased reinsurance protection as compared to approximately million of net premiums written  after premiums ceded on purchased reinsurance protection in the reduction reflects our decision to engage in a self managed run off as well as the purchase of more reinsurance protection in than in and the return of premiums of approximately million to our clients as we sought to reduce our loss exposures through policy cancellations 
similarly  our net premiums earned were million in as compared to million in our net premiums earned were impacted by significantly lower premium writings and  to a lesser extent  by premium returns associated with policy cancellations 
we expect significant decreases in net premiums earned in future periods as we do not expect to underwrite new policies  other than in our lloyd s segment 
historically  net premiums earned have been our primary source of revenue 
in net premiums earned contributed approximately to our total revenues  and in this contribution reduced to 
in  net revenues from non underwriting activities  such as net investment income and technical services revenues  were not sufficient to offset general and administrative expenses  interest expense and depreciation and amortization 
we expect that this trend will continue and that we will incur net losses in future periods 
we are seeking to mitigate these expected losses through continued overhead reduction strategies  particularly through headcount reductions 
in the fourth quarter of our total general and administrative expenses were million compared to million in the same period in  and our headcount  excluding lloyd s  has reduced to as at december   compared to on december  we expect that our shareholders equity will decline as we incur net losses in future periods 
however  we believe that our cash and investment asset portfolios totaling approximately million at december  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet currently foreseen obligations 
our net losses and loss expenses incurred were million in as compared to million in our loss ratio  which is a function of our selected ultimate loss ratios and specific loss events  was in as compared to in in we recorded net favorable development in the selection of certain prior period accident year ultimate net loss ratios in 
table of contents several of our product lines that reduced prior period loss reserves by approximately million 
as an example  our selected net loss ratios in our professional insurance product line for maturing accident periods in and reduced to from in this development resulted in reserve reductions associated with loss occurrences in these accident periods of approximately million in the fourth quarter of in  we also recorded adverse development of million  excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums  related to the hurricanes of and net adverse development of million related to the oil pipeline claim 
we believe that as our net earned premiums reduce  other than in lloyd s segment  our net loss ratio may become volatile in future periods if our loss estimates change 
our general and administrative expenses in were million  including million of direct expenses related to our lloyd s business 
our general and administrative expenses excluding those direct costs associated with our lloyd s business were million in as compared to million in since december   we have reduced our workforce  excluding lloyd s  from employees as of december  to employees as of december  our workforce is now allocated to underwriting in our lloyd s syndicate  run off of our exited business lines  claims handling  finance  actuarial  general corporate and administrative functions 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded severance costs of approximately million and million as a result of employee reductions following our decision to place our specialty insurance and reinsurance lines  other than syndicate  into self managed run off 
this severance cost relates to the cost associated with those employees who have been provided notice and those who we expect to be terminating in the future 
we continue to seek to reduce our general and administrative expenses including through further employee reductions and expect  barring unforeseen circumstances  that our general and administrative expenses will be lower than those incurred during during we incurred professional  legal and consulting costs of million compared to million in during we incurred significant professional  legal and consulting costs in connection with our board s review of strategic alternatives  the engagement of third party run off advisors to assist in certain projects related to our transition to run off  the restructuring of our lloyd s business  and the execution of and transition to our new letter of credit facility 
we have reduced our audit and sarbanes oxley section compliance costs from million in to an estimated million for in we also recorded amortization and impairment charges of million with respect to our intangible assets associated with our us insurance licenses 
at december   the carrying value of these licenses approximates their estimated net realizable value 
our investment portfolio yielded net investment income and net realized losses of million during the year ended december   an increase of million from the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our invested assets and higher market interest rates 
our average annualized effective yield calculated by dividing net investment income by the average amortized cost of invested assets  net of amounts payable or receivable for investments purchased or sold was approximately for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   reflecting higher market interest rates 
during  we determined that certain investment securities  with unrealized losses of approximately million  were other than temporarily impaired as a result of the continuing general uncertainties surrounding our business resulting from our decision to cease underwriting or seeking new business and to place most of our remaining insurance and reinsurance businesses into orderly run off 
we concluded that there are no absolute assurances that we will have the ability to hold the affected investments for a sufficient period of time to permit unrealized losses to recover 
the realization of these losses represents the maximum amount of potential losses in our investment securities if we were to sell all of these securities as of december  and are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates and not changes in credit quality 
as a result of our decision  
table of contents the affected investments were reduced to their estimated fair value  which becomes their new cost basis 
the recognition of the losses within net realized losses on investments has no effect on our shareholders equity  the market value of our investments  our cash flows or our liquidity 
segment information during the year ended december   following the decision of our board of directors to place most of our business in run off  we changed the composition of our reportable segments and renamed our specialty insurance segment and specialty reinsurance segment as specialty insurance run off segment and specialty reinsurance run off segment 
we continue to earn premiums in our insurance and reinsurance run off segments related to business written in prior periods and related to extensions and renewals of policies which we are legally required to write in business lines we have exited 
the specialty insurance run off and specialty reinsurance run off segments are more fully described as follows

specialty insurance run off 
our specialty insurance run off segment includes the remaining policies written in our traditional  structured and program specialty insurance product line until the second quarter of and those policies that we were required by regulation to write in the remainder of our traditional specialty insurance products included technical risk property  professional liability  environmental liability  fidelity and crime  surety  trade credit and political risk and marine and aviation 
these products were written both on a direct basis with insured clients or by reinsuring policies that were issued on our behalf by third party insurers and reinsurers 
our specialty insurance programs include the hbw program

technical services 
prior to the sale of esc in the third quarter of  our technical services segment provided diversified environmental investigation  remediation and engineering services  assessment services  other technical and information management services primarily in the environmental area in the us our technical services segment also provided technical and information management services to our specialty insurance run off and reinsurance run off segments 
following the sale of esc  the technical services segment consists of our two environmental liability assumption programs 
the results for the prior years have been reclassified to conform with the presentation of esc in discontinued operations for the year ended december  we have created a lloyd s operating segment for the results of syndicate which was previously aggregated with our specialty insurance run off reportable segment 
we believe it is no longer appropriate to aggregate lloyd s and specialty insurance run off operating segments given the different economic characteristics of the specialty insurance run off segment that is no longer writing new or renewal business while our lloyd s syndicate continues to write new and renewal business 
we refer to the specialty insurance run off  specialty reinsurance run off and lloyd s segments as our underwriting segments 
we refer to our environmental assumption programs as our technical services segment 
we evaluate each segment based on its underwriting or technical services results  as applicable  including items of revenue and expense that are associated with  and directly related to  each segment 
during the fourth quarter of we ceased allocating our indirect corporate  general and administrative expenses to our operating segments 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we allocated 
table of contents corporate general and administrative expenses to each segment based upon each product line s allocated capital for the relevant reporting period 
we allocated capital to each of our product lines through the estimated value at risk method  which used statistical analyses of historical market trends and volatility to estimate the probable amounts of capital at risk for each reporting period 
since our decision to conduct a self managed run off of most of our businesses  we no longer allocate capital to our segments and corporate expenses are no longer evaluated at the segment level 
we also do not allocate net investment income  and depreciation and amortization at the segment level 
the geographic locations in which we have conducted our business are the united states  europe and bermuda 
the location of the risks that are the subject of our insurance and reinsurance policies may be anywhere in the world 
main drivers of our results revenues we derive the majority of our revenues from three principal sources premiums from policies currently written by syndicate in our lloyds operating segment  the continuation of premiums that are being earned on policies in our specialty insurance and reinsurance run off segments that remain on our books and investment income from our investment portfolios 
we record premiums written at the time that there is sufficient evidence of agreement to the significant terms of the contract but no earlier than the effective date of the policy 
the amount of our insurance and reinsurance premiums written and earned depends on the number and type of policies we write  the amount of reinsurance protection we provide  as well as prevailing market prices 
furthermore  the amount of net premiums earned depends upon the type of contracts we have written  the contractual periods of the contracts we write  policy cancellations and commutations  the inception date of the contracts  the expired portions of the contract periods and the type of purchased reinsurance protection 
because of all these factor s  the amount of premiums written and ceded may not result in a correlative level of profitability 
reinsurance premiums written on certain types of contracts  notably treaty quota share contracts  may not be known definitively on the inception date of the contract and therefore include estimates of premiums written 
these estimates are based on data provided by the ceding companies or brokers  our underwriters judgment and underlying economic conditions 
our estimates of written premiums are re evaluated over the term of the contract period as underwriting information becomes available and as actual premiums are reported by the ceding companies or brokers 
for certain excess of loss reinsurance contracts we record the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  as our estimated premium written at inception of the contra ct 
subsequent changes to our premium estimates and also premiums returned through policy cancellations are recorded as adjustments to premiums written in the period in which they become known and could be material 
as a result of potential premium estimate reductions and cancellations in future periods  we may not receive all of our premiums receivable 
adjustments may significantly impact net income in the period in which premiums are determined  particularly when the subject contract is fully or substantially expired resulting in the adjustment being fully or substantially earned 
our investment income depends on the average invested assets in our investment portfolios and the yield that we earn on those invested assets 
our investment yield is a function of market interest rates and the credit quality and maturity period of our invested assets 
our investment portfolio consists principally of fixed income securities  short term investments  cash  and cash equivalents 
in addition  we realize capital gains or losses on sales of investments as a result of changing market conditions  including changes in market interest rates and changes in the credit quality of our invested assets 
we also recognize capital losses on investments as a result of other than temporary impairment charges 
under us gaap  our ava ilable for sale investments are carried at fair market value with unrealized gains and losses  to the extent we believe that such losses are temporary  on the investments included on our balance sheet in accumulated other comprehensive income loss net of income taxes as a separate component of shareholders equity 
our trading investments that relate to 
table of contents deposits associated with non risk bearing contracts are recorded at estimated fair value with the change in fair value included in net realized gains and losses on investments in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
the objective of our current investment strategy is to preserve investment principal  maintain liquidity and manage duration risk between investment assets and insurance liabilities when they become due  at the time of either loss settlement  cancellations or commutations  while maximizing investment returns through a diversified portfolio 
until the sale of esc in september  we also generated revenues to a much smaller extent  in our technical services segment from the remediation of environmental liability obligations that we have assumed 
expenses our expenses primarily consist of net loss and loss expenses  general and administrative expenses and acquisition expenses 
net loss and loss expenses  which are net of loss and loss expenses recovered under our ceded reinsurance contracts  depend on the number and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts we write and reflect our best estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses we expect to incur on each contract written using various actuarial analyses 
actual losses and loss expenses will depend on either actual costs to settle insurance and reinsurance claims  or the estimated loss amount that we may agree with our policyholders under the terms of commutation and cancellation arrangements 
our ability to accurately estimate expected ultimate loss and loss expense at the time of pricing each insurance and reinsurance contract and the occurrence of unexpected high loss severity catastrophe events are critical factors in determining our profitability 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel related expenses including severance costs  professional fees  leases and other operating overheads 
from time to time we engage administrative service providers and legal  accounting  tax and financial advisors 
these general and administrative expenses may be incurred directly by a segment or indirectly at the corporate level 
acquisition expenses  which are net of expenses recovered under our ceded reinsurance contracts  consist principally of commissions  fees  brokerage and tax expenses that are directly related to obtaining and writing insurance and reinsurance contracts 
typically  acquisition expenses are based on a certain percentage of the premiums written on contracts of insurance and reinsurance and may be adjustable based upon loss experience 
these expenses are a function of the number and type of insurance and reinsurance contracts written 
we may not be able to recover all or a portion of our acquisition costs on commuted or cancelled policies 
until the sale of esc in september  we also incurred expenses directly related to and arising from our environmental remediation activities 
these direct costs primarily include remediation contract related expenses 
these costs are a function of  and are proportional to  the level of remediation revenues earned from the completion of remediation activities 
financial ratios the financial ratios we use include the net loss and loss expense ratio and the acquisition expense ratio 
our net loss and loss expense ratio is calculated as net losses and loss expenses incurred divided by net premiums earned 
our acquisition expense ratio is calculated by dividing acquisition expenses by net premiums earned 
our net loss and loss expense ratio and acquisition expense ratio provide a measure of the current profitability of the earned portions of our written insurance and reinsurance contracts 
because our net premiums earned will decrease significantly following our decision to place most of our lines of business into run off  we expect that our net loss ratios will continue to be volatile

revenues substantially all of our revenues were generated by our underwriting subsidiaries in the us  bermuda and europe 
technical services revenues were derived from the operations of esc until its sale on september  and from the operations of our environmental liability assumption programs 
premiums 
gross premiums written were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in our gross premiums written reflects the decision to discontinue writing new business in our insurance and reinsurance lines of business  other than in our lloyd s segment  and the associated return of premiums to our clients totaling million during following cancellation or commutation of policies 

table of contents our lloyd s segment contributed million of total gross written premiums in  or  compared to million  or in this increase in lloyd s contribution reflects the run off status of other segments in and modest growth in our lloyd s operations in premiums ceded were million for the year ended december  a decrease of million  or compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in premiums ceded primarily reflects the reduction in gross premiums written net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net premiums earned reflects the decision to discontinue writing new business in our insurance and reinsurance lines of business  other than in our lloyd s segment and the return of premiums to our clients during following cancellation or commutation of policies 
our net premiums written are typically earned over the risk periods of the underlying insurance policies which are generally twelve months 
net premiums written that are not yet earned and are deferred as unearned premium reserves  net of deferred reinsurance premiu ms  totaled million at december  and will be earned and recognized in our results of operations in future periods 
the contribution to net premiums earned from our lloyd s segment is detailed under results by segments below 
technical services revenues 
technical services revenues were million for the year ended december  a decrease of million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a significant portion of remediation of one of our environmental liability assumption programs occurring during the second and third quarters of the remediation is now close to being completed and  as a result  has not generated technical services revenues in to the same extent as it did in we expect that our technical services revenues will continue to decrease in future periods as the remediation is closer to completion  and we do not plan to engage in any further environmental liability assumption programs 
net investment income and net realized losses 
net investment income and net realized losses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in net investment income of million because of our larger amount of invested assets and increases in market interest rates  which is offset by an increase in net realized losses of million  of which million is attributable to other than temporary impairment losses recognized during the year ended december   compared to other than temporary losses of million in net investment income was million for the year ended december  an increase of million  or compared to million for the year ended december  this was derived primarily from interest earned on fixed maturity and short term investments plus amortization of discounts on fixed maturity investments  partially offset by investment management fees 
our average annualized effective yield calculated by dividing net investment income by the average amortized cost of invested assets  net of amounts payable or receivable for investments purchased or sold was approximately for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   reflecting rises in market interest rates 
net realized losses of million were generated primarily from our other than temporary impairment charge of million and also as we sought to manage our total investment returns and the duration of our investment portfolios 
as of december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately years with an average credit rating of approximately aa  compared to years with an average credit rating of approximately aa as at december  net foreign exchange losses 
net foreign exchange losses were million for the year ended december  compared to net foreign exchange gains of million in the increase in net foreign exchange losses was due to an increase in foreign currency assets  liabilities  particularly in syndicate combined with a weakening us dollar during against those foreign currencies

net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  net losses and loss expenses are a function of our net premiums earned and changes in our expected ultimate losses and loss expenses for reported and unreported claims on contracts of insurance and reinsurance underwritten 
the decrease in net losses and loss expenses is due to

several commutations of assumed reinsurance contracts 
we incurred net losses and loss expenses of approximately million related to the tornadoes that occurred in the first quarter of our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  also included adverse development of approximately million excluding reinstatement premiums related to the hurricane storms and additional net losses of million related to damage caused by an oil pipeline in california which ruptured during a mudslide in the first quarter of  for which the damage is covered by an insurance contract written in our environmental liability product line 
this development in was primarily related to extended remediation activities required by the relevant environmental age ncies 
there remains the possibility of further negative development on this loss in the future  particularly if the timing of the completion of the remediation plan for the spill is further delayed 
offsetting these adverse developments during  we recorded approximately million of net favorable loss development in several product lines related to maturing accident periods for which actual loss experience was better than expected 
we continue to be exposed to potentially significant losses in lines of business where claims may not be reported for some period of time after those claims are incurred 
in estimating reserves we may utilize a variety of standard actuarial methods that we believe are in line with industry practice  including the expected loss ratio method  the bornhuetter ferguson method  paid loss development method and reported loss development method 
the loss reserves are based on the loss development characteristics of the specific line of business and specific contracts within that line of business and considers coverage  type of business  maturity of loss data and claims 
our total net loss ratio calculated by dividing net losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned was for the year ended december   a decrease of compared to a total net loss ratio of for the year ended december  the decrease in the total net loss and loss expense ratio is due primarily to the hurricanes and the oil pipeline loss that occurred in and  to a lesser extent  favorable development of expected losses in certain of our product lines 
acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in acquisition expenses is due to the decrease in the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
our acquisition expense ratio for the year ended december  was  which is comparable to our acquisition expense ratio of for the year ended december  deferred acquisition costs include  as of december   million of acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance and reinsurance that will be amortized in future periods as the premiums written to which they relate are earned 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were comprised of 
table of contents million of personnel related expenses including million of severance costs and million of other expenses during the year ended december  compared to million of personnel related expenses including million of severance costs and million of other expenses during the year ended december  the decrease in general and administrative expenses is due to the cost saving measures taken in response to the decision to cease writing new business in but were offset by increased severance costs and to a lesser extent  the increased fees associated with ongoing efforts relating to sarbanes oxley section compliance and costs relating to information technology development 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  and relates to the increase in interest rates during leading to a higher interest charge on the junior subordinated debentures 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of intangible assets was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the majority of the increase relates to an impairment charge of million with respect to our intangible assets associated with our us insurance licenses 
at december   the carrying value of these licenses approximates their estimated net realizable value 
we also wrote off approximately million of leasehold improvements during the fourth quarter of associated with our anticipated relocation of our new york operations 
we have not recorded any net deferred income tax benefits or assets relating to tax operating losses generated by our subsidiaries since our results of operations include a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   the net valuation allowance increased by approximately million  to million 
discontinued operations 
loss income from operations of discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations was million for the period from january  to september   compared to income of million for the year ended december  and consisted of revenues and expenses from esc  which was sold on september  esc s loss income from operations  previously included in the technical services segment  for the period from january  to september   and the years ended december  and  now reported in discontinued operations  are as follows

esc s technical services revenues include the inter company revenues charged by esc to the liability transfer programs and to our underwriting segment 

table of contents technical services revenues 
technical services revenues were million for the period ended december  compared to million for year ended december  the decrease is mainly due to esc generating significant inter company revenue for the remediation of the sites of one of our environmental liability assumption programs during the second and third quarter of as compared to the period from january  to september  when there was much less remediation activity 
the decrease is also due to our exit from the environmental insurance business during the first half of direct technical services costs

direct technical services costs  as a percentage of technical services revenues were approximately for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the period ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of personnel related expenses

revenues substantially all of our revenues were generated by our underwriting subsidiaries in the us  bermuda and europe 
technical services revenues were derived from the operations of esc and our two environmental liability assumption programs 
premiums 
gross premiums written were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our gross premiums written was largely due to the contribution of million  or  of our gross premiums written  from our lloyd s syndicate  which commenced during december the increase also reflected continued growth in all of our specialty insurance segment product lines and our marine  technical risk and aviation product line in our specialty reinsurance segment 
shortly after hurricane rita  we discontinued writing new and most renewal business in our technical risk property and property reinsurance lines of business other than our program business  which accounted for approximately million  or  of our gross premium written during the year ended december  
table of contents premiums ceded were million for the year ended december  an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in premiums ceded primarily reflected the growth in gross premiums written  approximately million of premiums ceded resulting from the october portfolio transfer of substantially all of our in force technical risk property insurance and property reinsurance business and approximately million in purchased reinsurance and retrocessional protection including reinstatement premiums to help limit our net loss exposures to natural catastrophe events 
the increase of premiums ceded was attributable to a lesser extent to the development of th e reinsurance program for our specialty insurance segment product lines  which was restructured during the year ended december  the restructure involved the commutation of our reinsurance treaty protection in our professional liability and fidelity product lines  which was ceded on an excess of loss basis 
the unexpired portions of this business were then transferred  effective april   into our reinsurance treaty  which was ceded on a proportional quota share basis 
net premiums earned were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting the growth in premiums written and the earning and amortization of premiums written and ceded during the years ended december  and our net premiums written are typically earned over the risk periods of the underlying insurance policies which are generally twelve months 
net premiums written that are not yet earned and are deferred as unearned premium reserves  net of deferred reinsurance premiums  totaled million at december  and were earned and recognized in our results of operations in technical services revenues 
technical services revenues were million for the year ended december  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase in technical services revenues was primarily attributable to increased remediation revenues associated with our liability assumption program in buffalo  new york 
net investment income and net realized losses gains 
net investment income and net realized losses gains totaled million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to an increase in net investment income of million because of our larger amount of invested assets and rises in market interest rates  which was offset by an increase in net realized losses of million  of which million was attributable to other than temporary impairment losses recognized during the year ended december  net investment income was million for the year ended december  and was derived primarily from interest earned on fixed maturity and short term investments  partially offset by investment management fees and amortization of discounts on fixed maturity investments 
our average annualized effective yield calculated by dividing net investment income by the average amortized cost of invested assets  net of amounts payable or receivable for investments purchased or sold was approximately for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   reflecting rises in market interest rates 
net realized losses of million were generated primarily from our other than temporary impa irment charge of million and also as we sought to manage our total investment returns and the duration of our investment portfolios 
as of december   the average duration of our investment portfolio was approximately years with an average credit rating of approximately aa 
expenses net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  net losses and loss expenses are a function of our net premiums earned and our expected ultimate losses and loss expenses for reported and unreported claims on contracts of insurance and reinsurance underwritten 
the increase in net losses and loss expenses was due to

the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned as our insurance and reinsurance portfolios continued to mature

the increase in loss occurrences  particularly those related to the hurricanes and the first quarter rupture of an oil pipeline in california during a mudslide  and 
spacer

gif 
general reserve strengthening relating primarily to our hbw program  lloyd s  professional and environmental lines 
included in our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  are specific loss estimates on contracts of reinsurance and insurance insuring claims arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our preliminary loss estimates for the hurricanes totaled million excluding the negative impact of reinstatement premiums of million  which was included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december   compared to million included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our estimate of our exposure to ultimate claim costs associated with these hurricanes was primarily based on currently available information  claims notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a review of affected contracts and discussions with cedents and brokers 
our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  also included estimated gross and net loss estimates of million and million related to damage caused by an oil pipeline in california which ruptured during a mudslide in the first quarter of  for which the damage was covered by an insurance contract written in our environmental liability product line 
in addition to the hurricanes and the oil pipeline loss  as of december   we have received a limited amount of significant reported losses 
however  we participate in lines of business where claims may not be reported for some period of time after those claims are incurred 
with respect to the year ended december   in establishing our reserves for losses and loss expenses  we reviewed reserve estimates of an actuary employed with our company and of an external actuarial specialist 
our reserves for losses and loss expenses were also reviewed by our independent registered public accounting firm during its auditing procedures 
we recorded these reserves as of the year ended december  based on the highest aggregate reserve amount of the estimates we reviewed 
as part of our year end closing process  we strengthened our loss reserves for by approximately million 
given the immaturity of our business and very limited claims history  we relied on pricing  loss and expense data ac cumulated by our consulting actuary  historical industry results  and to a limited extent  our own reported claims history in establishing loss ratios for each line of business 
although we had not experienced significant reported claims in our casualty insurance line  we worked closely with our independent loss specialist and concluded to generally strengthen our loss ratios in our hbw program  lloyd s and environmental lines with respect to the year ended december  our total net loss ratio calculated by dividing net losses and loss expenses by net premiums earned was for the year ended december   an increase of compared to a total net loss ratio of for the year ended december  the increase in the total net loss ratio was due both to the greater magnitude of the hurricanes that occurred in the second half of as compared to those that occurred in the third quarter of and to the oil pipeline loss 
however  the extent of the impact of the actual catastrophes in was mitigated by our purchased reinsurance and retrocessional protection and increased net premiums earned compared to the year ended december  acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in acquisition expenses was due to the increase in the number of insurance and reinsurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
our acquisition expense ratio for the year ended december  was  a decrease of compared to our acquisition expense ratio of for the year ended december  the decrease was due to four factors 
first  during  our earned premium was more heavily weighted towards specialty insurance  which carries lower acquisition costs than specialty reinsurance 
second  we were paying less fronting costs on our specialty insurance lines because we were licensed in more 
table of contents states and no longer needed to utilize fronting companies to the same extent in order to write our business 
third  our ceding commission income that we were recovering on our specialty insurance segment s reinsurance treaties increased during as a result of the restructuring of those treaties during the second quarter of finally  we paid less commission in our hbw program during because the contracts contain sliding scale commission provisions that vary with changes in the selected loss ratio 
deferred acquisition costs include  as of december   million of acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance and reinsurance that will be amortized in future periods as the premiums written to which they relate are earned 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses were comprised of million of personnel related expenses including million of severance costs and million of other general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  compared to million of personnel related expenses and million of other expenses during the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees as we grew our lines of business  especially in europe and our severance costs 
to a lesser extent  the increase was attributed to increases in auditing fees  fees associated with ongoing efforts relating to sarbanes oxley section compliance and costs relating to information technology development 
general and administrative expenses related to our underwriting segment were million for the year ended december   which included million of expenses charged by our technical services segment for technical and information management services  and million of expenses related to our technical services segment 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  and related to the interest expense on our junior subordinated debentures 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization of intangible assets was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december   and consisted of amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of esc and depreciation of fixed assets 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the purchase of additional fixed assets throughout and as we grew our lines of business 
we did not record any net deferred income tax benefits or assets relating to tax operating losses generated by our subsidiaries since our results of operations included a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
for the year ended december   the net valuation allowance increased by approximately million  to million 
results by segments underwriting prior to the second quarter of  we principally provided insurance and reinsurance protection for risks that are often unusual or difficult to place  that did not fit the underwriting criteria of standard commercial product carriers and that required extensive technical underwriting and assessment resources in order to be profitably underwritten 
following our decision to engage in a self managed run off  we changed the composition of our reportable segments to recognize that our run off insurance and run off reinsurance segments were the specialty insurance run off and specialty reinsurance run off segments respectively  and to separate the lloyd s operating segment from our specialty insurance run off reportable segmen t 
in measuring the performance of our specialty insurance run off  specialty reinsurance run off and lloyd s segments  we consider each segment s net underwriting income and a number of financial ratios 
net underwriting income is the sum of net premiums earned less net losses and loss expenses  acquisition expenses and direct and allocated general and administrative expenses 

table of contents in the fourth quarter of we revised our expense allocation methodology to only allocate direct general and administrative expenses among our segments 
indirect corporate general and administrative expenses are no longer allocated and this has been reflected in the years ended december   and the following is a discussion of our net underwriting results and profitability measures by segment for the years ended december   and years ended december  and the following table summarizes our net underwriting results and profitability measures for our segments for the years ended december  and specialty insurance run off

premiums 
gross and net premiums written were million and million for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the year ended december  the significant decrease in our specialty insurance run off segment s gross and net premiums written was due to the decision to cease writing new business in  our decision to run off the majority of our businesses and the effect of premium returns to our clients and the transfer of policies to third parties 
during we returned or transferred approximately million of gross written premiums since our decision to run off these product lines and to reduce the amount of our in force policy exposures 
the table below shows gross and net premiums written by product line for the years ended december  and  whether written on a traditional insurance  program or structured basis

favorable development in our ultimate loss ratio selections in certain product lines  particularly in our professional insurance product line in which our selected ultimate net loss ratio for maturing accident periods has reduced to approximately in from approximately in  resulting in a reduction of net loss and loss expense reserves of approximately million 
we incurred net losses and loss expenses of approximately million related to the tornadoes that occurred in the first quarter of our estimated ultimate losses during the year ended december  also included estimated gross and net losses of million and million related to damage caused by an oil pipeline in california which ruptured during a mudslide in the first quarter of  for which the damage is covered by an insurance contract written in our environmental liability product line 
there remains the possibility of further negative development on this loss in the future  particularly if the timing of the completion of the remediation plan for the spill is further delayed 
offsetting this adverse deve lopment during  we recorded approximately million of net favorable development to several of our insurance product lines for which actual loss experience in maturing accident periods was better than expected 
we continue to participate in lines of business where claims may not be reported for some period of time after those claims are incurred 
our specialty insurance run off segment net loss ratio was for the year ended december  a decrease of compared to a net loss ratio of for the year ended december  the decrease in the specialty insurance run off segment net loss ratio is primarily due to the significant loss estimates arising in from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma as well as to the loss estimates arising in from the ruptured oil pipeline loss 
the hurricanes did not contribute any loss ratio percentage points to the specialty insurance run off segment net loss ratio in compared to in as discussed above  the reduction in certain of our product lines ultimate net loss ratios for more mature accide nt periods also contributed to the lower insurance run off segment net loss ratio in acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in acquisition expenses was due to the substantial decline in the number of insurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
these acquisition expenses primarily represented brokerage fees  commission fees and premium tax expenses and were net of ceding commissions earned on purchased reinsurance treaties 
our acquisition expense ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in our acquisition expense ratio in the specialty insurance run off segment is primarily due to the impact of purchased reinsurance protection in and which reduced net earned premium by a higher proportion in than the increase is also due  to a lesser extent  to the return of premiums following the cancellation of policies  including  in some instances  earned premium 
deferred acquisition costs include  as of december   million of acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance that will be amortized in future periods as the premiums written to w hich they relate are earned

however  shortly after hurricane rita  we discontinued writing new and most renewal business in our technical risk property line of business other than our program business  which accounted for approximately million  or  of our specialty insurance run off segment s gross premiums written during the year ended december  we also retroceded substantially all the in force business  as of october   in this line other than our program business by a portfolio transfer to a third party reinsurer 
during the year ended december   we continued to write the hbw program in our technical risk property product line which accounted for approximately million  or  of the technical risk property line of business and of total specialty insurance run off segment gross premiums written in the year ended december  the hbw program accounted for million  or  of the technical risk property product line and of the total specialty insurance run off segment gross premiums written for the year ended december  we are no longer writing business in our technical risk property line other than the programs that are part of that line 
the policies in the program are underwritten by a th ird party agent which follows our underwriting guidelines

the remaining of our specialty insurance run off segment gross premiums written 
table of contents were generated through a number of brokers  only one of which accounted for more than of our total specialty insurance run off segment gross premiums written 
premiums ceded were million during the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in premiums ceded reflects the increase in our gross premiums written  approximately million of premiums ceded resulting from the october portfolio transfer of substantially all of our in force technical risk property insurance and property reinsurance business and approximately million from reinsurance treaties that we have entered into for our specialty insurance run off product lines to help limit our net loss exposures to natural catastrophe events 
the increase of premiums ceded is attributable to a lesser extent to the development of the reinsurance program for our specialty insurance run off segment product lines  which was restructured during the year ended december   as described above 
net premiums earned during the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  representing growth of premiums written and the earning and amortization of premiums written and ceded during the years ended december  and gross premiums written and ceded premiums are earned over the period of each insured risk 
the terms of our insurance contracts range from between one and ten years with the majority of our contracts being for a one year period 
other income 
other income was million for the year ended december  and related to income  including fees  recognized on non traditional insurance contracts 
net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to million for the year ended december  net losses and loss expenses are a function of our net premiums earned and our expected ultimate losses and loss expenses for reported and unreported claims on contracts of insurance and reinsurance underwritten 
the increase in net losses and loss expenses is due to

the increase in loss occurrences  particularly those related to the hurricanes and the first quarter rupture of an oil pipeline in california during a mudslide

general reserve strengthening relating primarily to our hbw program  lloyd s  professional and environmental lines 
included in our expected ultimate losses in our specialty insurance run off segment during the year ended december  are specific loss estimates on contracts of insurance insuring claims arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimate of our specialty insurance run off segment s exposure to ultimate claim costs associated with these hurricanes was million excluding the negative impact of net reinstatement premiums of million  compared to million included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our preliminary estimate of our exposure to ultimate claim costs associated with these hurricanes is based on curre ntly available information  claims notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a review of affected contracts and discussion and brokers 
given the immaturity of our business and very limited claims history  we have relied on pricing  loss and expense data accumulated by our consulting actuary  historical industry results  and to a limited extent  our own reported claims history in establishing loss ratios for each line of business 
although we have not experienced significant reported claims in our specialty insurance run off lines  other than those related to the hurricanes and the oil pipeline claim  we have worked closely with our independent loss specialist and concluded to generally strengthen our loss ratios in our hbw program  lloyd s and environmental lines with respect to the year ended december  our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  also include estimated gross and net loss estimates of million and million related to damage caused by an oil 
table of contents pipeline in california which ruptured during a mudslide in the first quarter of  for which the damage is covered by an insurance contract issued by our environmental liability product line 
our specialty insurance run off segment net loss ratio was for the year ended december  an increase of compared to a net loss ratio of for the year ended december  the increase in the specialty insurance run off segment net loss ratio is due to the loss estimates arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma as well as to the loss estimates arising from the ruptured oil pipeline loss 
however  the extent of the impact of the actual catastrophes in was mitigated by our purchased reinsurance protection in our specialty insurance run off segment and increased net premiums earned in our specialty insurance run off segment compared to the year ended december  the hurricanes contrib uted loss ratio percentage points to the specialty insurance run off segment net loss ratio 
acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in acquisition expenses was due to the increase in the number of insurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
these acquisition expenses primarily represented brokerage fees  commission fees and premium tax expenses and were net of ceding commissions earned on purchased reinsurance treaties 
our acquisition expense ratio was for the year ended december  a decrease of compared to for the year ended december  the reduction in our acquisition expense ratio in the specialty insurance run off segment is primarily due to three factors 
first  we are paying less fronting costs because we are licensed in more states and no longer need to utilize fronting companies to the same extent in order to write our insurance business 
second  our ceding commission income that we are recovering on our specialty insurance run off segment s reinsurance treaties increased during as a result of the restructuring of those treaties during the second quarter of third  we paid less commission in our hbw program during the year ended december  as a result of the contracts containing sliding scale commission provisions that vary with changes in the selected loss ratio 
the selected loss ratio under the hbw contracts increased from in to in deferred acquisition costs include  as of december   million of acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance that would be amortized in future periods as the premiums written to which they relate are earned 
general and administrative expenses 
direct general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in our general and administrative expense was due to the additional number of employees hired throughout and the increase is also attributed to severance costs  increases in auditing fees  fees associated with ongoing efforts relating to sarbanes oxley section compliance and costs relating to information technology development  which were allocated to our specialty insurance run off segment

gross and net premiums written were million and million for the year ended december  compared to million and million of gross and net premiums for the year ended december  the decrease in our specialty reinsurance run off segment s net premiums written reflects the decrease in our property and casualty reinsurance business lines as a result of our decision to discontinue the writing of new and renewal business in our property reinsurance business line and the commutation of two treaties in our casualty reinsurance business line 
the decline was partially offset by growth in our marine reinsurance business line during the table below shows gross and net premiums written by product line whether written on a traditional reinsurance  programs or structured basis

table of contents october portfolio transfer of substantially all of our in force technical risk property insurance and property reinsurance business 
ceded premiums are earned over the period of each insured risk 
net premiums earned of million for the year ended december  have increased by million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase reflects the earning of premiums on contracts written during the years ended december  and and is offset by the impact of the decision to discontinue the writing of new and renewal business in our property reinsurance line of business  the october portfolio transfer of substantially all of our in force technical risk property insurance and property reinsurance business  the commutation of two treaties in our casualty reinsurance business line and the purchase of additional retrocessional protection 
gross premiums written in our spe cialty reinsurance run off segment are being earned over the periods of reinsured or underlying insured risks which are typically one year 
other income 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   and related to income  including fees  recognized on non traditional reinsurance contracts 
a more detailed description of these non traditional contracts is provided under non traditional contracts below 
net losses and loss expenses 
net losses and loss expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net losses and loss expenses incurred was due to increased loss occurrences  particularly those related to the hurricanes  as well as the increase in the number of reinsurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
net losses and loss expenses were a function of our net premiums earned and our expected ultimate losses and loss expenses for reported and unreported claims on contracts of reinsurance underwritten 
included in our expected ultimate losses during the year ended december  are specific loss estimates on contracts of reinsurance insuring claims arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma 
our estimate of our specialty reinsurance run off segment s exposure to ultimate claim costs associated with these hurricanes totaled million excluding the negative impact and net reinstatement premiums of million  which was included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  compared to million included in net losses and loss expenses for the year ended december  from hurricanes charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
our preliminary estimate of ultimate losses from these events was primarily based on currently available information  claims notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a review of affected contracts and discussion with cedents and brokers 
other than the hurricane losses  as of december   we had received a limited amount of significant reported losses in our specialty reinsurance run off segment 
our specialty reinsurance run off segment net loss ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the specialty reinsurance run off segment net loss ratio is due to the magnitude of the loss estimates arising from hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma described above 
however  the extent of the impact of the actual catastrophes in was mitigated by our purchased retrocessional protection during the year ended december  the hurricanes contributed loss ratio percentage points to the segment loss ratio 
acquisition expenses 
acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december  an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in acquisition expenses was due to the increase in the number of reinsurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned 
these acquisition expenses primarily represented brokerage and ceding commissions 
our acquisition expense ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase reflects certain contracts with higher commission rates that were written during the second and third quarters of in our property  casualty and marine  technical risk and aviation reinsurance product lines and the impact of ceded premiums and ceded reinstatement premiums reducing our specialty reinsurance run off segment s net earned premium 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
direct general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december  an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december   reflecting the additional number of employees hired throughout and the increase is also attributed to severance costs  increases in auditing fees  fees associated with ongoing efforts relating to sarbanes oxley section compliance and costs relating to information technology development  which were allocated to our specialty reinsurance run off segment

technical services revenues 
technical services revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in technical services revenues is primarily attributable to increased remediation revenues associated with liability transfer project in buffalo  new york 
general and administrative expenses 
direct general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to increased staffing levels  higher overhead allocation arising from the development of our infrastructure and sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts  and professional fees associated with the environmental liability assumption program in buffalo  new york

prior to we had not experienced significant favorable or adverse development in our estimation of loss and loss expense reserves since we started our operations in and only wrote a small number of contracts during that year 
we grew and diversified our product lines during and in we recorded approximately million in net loss and loss expenses in our property and marine reinsurance product lines associated with the four florida hurricanes  charley  frances  ivan and jeanne 
during the year ended december   we increased these loss estimates to approximately million as additional information was reported to us by clients and others 
this adverse development of million was partially offset in by net favorable development of approximately million in certain of our other short tail policies and product lines  which began to mature with actual loss experience that was better than our expected losses recorded during or before in  we saw further favorable e xperience in our reserves as a result of lower than expected actual reported losses 
we also transitioned our ultimate loss selection method in our professional insurance product line from the expected loss ratio method to the bornhuetter ferguson method which reduced our and accident period reserves by approximately million in in we recorded approximately million in net loss and loss expenses excluding reinstatement premiums in our property and marine reinsurance and technical property and fidelity insurance product lines associated with the hurricanes  katrina  rita and wilma 
we also recorded approximately million in net loss and loss expenses associated with an oil pipeline claim in our environmental product line 
with respect to the year ended december   we worked closely with our independent loss specialists and concluded to generally strengthen our loss ratios and net loss reserves in several product lines including our environmental  professional and hbw lines 
this resulted in approximately million of reserv e adjustments at the end of in we increased our hurricane loss estimates excluding reinstatement premiums by million to approximately million as new information was reported to us by our clients and others 
in addition  we increased our net loss reserves on the oil pipeline claim by approximately million during as we were required by the relevant environmental agencies to extend our remediation activities 
in addition to the favorable loss development of million in our professional insurance product line described above  in we also recorded approximately million of net favorable 
table of contents development in several of our other product lines  including our fidelity  the property component of hbw  environmental and surety lines 
actual loss experience in these product lines was better than expected for maturing accident periods for and financial condition and liquidity quanta holdings is organized as a bermuda holding company and as such  has no direct operations of its own 
quanta holdings assets consist of investments in our subsidiaries through which we conduct substantially all of our business at lloyd s  our specialty insurance and reinsurance run off and our technical services operations 
as of december   we had operations in the us  bermuda  ireland and the united kingdom 
as a holding company  quanta holdings has and will continue to have funding needs for general corporate expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  dividends on our preferred shares  taxes  and the payment of other obligations 
funds to meet these obligations are expected to come primarily from dividends  interest  return of capital and other statutorily permissible payments from our operating subsidiaries 
we believe that the operating subsidiaries have sufficient assets to pay their respective currently foreseen insurance liabilities as they become due 
however  the ability of our operating subsidiaries to make payments to quanta holdings is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the domiciles in wh ich the subsidiaries operate 
these laws and regulations subject our subsidiaries to significant restrictions and require  among other things  the maintenance of minimum solvency requirements and limitations regarding the amount of dividends  or the approval of certain regulators in the event of a return of capital  that these subsidiaries can ultimately pay to quanta holdings 
in addition  following the withdrawal of our am best rating  the bermuda monetary authority  the regulator of our most significant subsidiary  quanta bermuda  amended quanta bermuda s license to  among other things  restrict it from making any dividend payments to quanta holdings without the approval of the bma or to enter into new transactions 
additionally  there remain significant restrictions regarding our ability to remove the funds deposited to support our underwriting capacity of syndicate at lloyd s 
we are working with applicable regulatory authorities to facilitate our ability  as the business we wrote exp ires over time  to pay dividends or return capital from our insurance operating subsidiaries to the holding company 
the paying of dividends or return of capital to the holding company will require regulatory approval 
in addition  because we have regulated subsidiaries which are owned by other regulated subsidiaries  which we refer to as stacked subsidiaries  obtaining approval to dividend funds or return capital requires the approval of a number of regulators before the funds can be made available to quanta holdings 
working with these regulators takes a significant amount of time  requires many steps  may result in payments of smaller amounts of funds from one subsidiary to another or to quanta holdings and we will be required to meet many conditions 
for further information regarding these restrictions  see item business regulation 
we are also subject to constraints under the bermuda companies act that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares 
we may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution if we have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or will after the payment be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets will thereby be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts 
while we currently meet these requirements  there can be no assurance that we will continue to do so in the future 
as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of approximately million 
we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances include approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities in syndicate  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
aft er giving effect to these assets pledged or placed in trust  we estimate that on december  we had net unrestricted investments of approximately million  including net cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
of the million  
table of contents approximately million represents net unrestricted investments held by our operating subsidiaries of which approximately million is held by quanta bermuda 
additionally  quanta indemnity company  quanta specialty lines insurance company and quanta reinsurance us ltd  which are subsidiaries of quanta bermuda  hold approximately million of net unrestricted investments 
the remaining amount of the net unrestricted investments balance is held by quanta europe 
any distributions from these subsidiaries are subject to significant legal  regulatory and compliance requirements 
some of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contain termination rights that were triggered by the am best rating downgrades 
some of these insurance and reinsurance contracts also require us to post additional security 
further  the downgrade in our rating from b very good to b fair triggered additional termination provisions and required the posting of additional security in certain of our other insurance and reinsurance contracts 
we were required to post additional security either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
in addition  many of our ins urance contracts and certain of our reinsurance contracts provide for cancellation at the option of the policyholder regardless of our financial strength rating 
accordingly  we may also elect to post security under these other contracts 
as of december   we had net cash and cash equivalent balances and investments of approximately million that are available to post as security or place in trust 
we currently believe that we have sufficient assets to pay our foreseen liabilities as they become due and meet our foreseen collateral requirements within our subsidiaries 
however  we cannot issue new letters of credit under our credit agreement if we have incurred a material adverse effect or if a default exists under the agreement 
as of december  and march   we had obligations related to fully secured letters of credit of approximately million and million 
financial condition our board of directors established our investment policies and created guidelines for hiring external investment managers 
management implements our investment strategy with the assistance of the external managers 
our investment guidelines specify minimum criteria on the overall credit quality  liquidity and risk return characteristics of our investment portfolio and include limitations on the size of particular holdings  as well as restrictions on investments in different asset classes 
the board of directors monitors our overall investment returns and reviews compliance with our investment guidelines 
our investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize total return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
investment decision making is guided mainly by the nature and timing of our expected liability payouts  management s forecast of our cash flows and the possibility that we will have unexpected cash demands  for example  to satisfy claims due to catastrophic losses 
our investment portfolio currently consists mainly of highly rated and liquid fixed income securities 
however  to the extent our insurance liabilities are correlated with an asset class outside our minimum criteria  our investment guidelines will allow a deviation from those minimum criteria provided such deviations reduce overall risk 
during we determined that certain of our investment securities  with unrealized losses of approximately million were other than temporarily impaired 
the realization of these losses represented the maximum amount of potential losses in our investment securities if we were to sell all of these securities at the time of our determinations and were primarily due to changes in market interest rates and not changes in credit quality 
as a result of our decision  the affected investments have been reduced to their estimated fair value  which becomes their new cost basis 
the recognition of the losses did not affect our shareholders equity  the market value of our investments  our cash flows or our liquidity 
the evalua tion for other than temporary impairments require the application of significant judgment  including our intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for possible recovery 
we believe we have sufficient assets to pay our currently foreseen 
table of contents liabilities as they become due and we have no immediate intent to liquidate the investments securities affected  other than in the normal course of our investment management policies 
however  we may be required to sell securities to satisfy return premium or loss obligations on contracts that are cancelled or commuted 
due to this and to the continuing general uncertainties surrounding our business resulting from our decision to cease underwriting or seeking new business and to place most of our remaining insurance and reinsurance businesses into orderly run off  we concluded that there are no absolute assurances that we will have the ability to hold the affected investments for a sufficient period of time to permit unrealized losses to recover 
it is possible that the impairment factors evaluated by management and fair values will change in subsequent periods  resulting in material impairment charges 
our investment guidelines require compliance with applicable local regulations and laws 
without board approval  we will not purchase financial futures  forwards  options  swaps and other derivatives  except for instruments that are purchased as part of our business  for purposes of hedging capital market risks including those within our structured products transactions  or as replication transactions  which are defined as a set of derivative  insurance and or securities transactions that when combined produce the equivalent economic results of an investment meeting our investment guidelines 
while we expect that the majority of our investment holdings will be denominated in us dollars  we may make investments in other curren cy denominations depending upon the currencies in which loss reserves are maintained  or as may be required by regulation or law 
the market value of our total investment portfolio including cash and cash equivalents was million  of which million related to available for sale fixed maturity investments  million related to cash and cash equivalents  million related to available for sale short term investments and million to trading investments related to deposit liabilities 
the majority of our investment portfolio consists of fixed maturity and cash investments which are currently managed by the following external investment advisors deutsche asset management and jp morgan investment management inc  our external investment advisors 
custodians of our externally managed investment portfolios are comerica incorporated  jp morgan chase bank na and citibank na our investment guidelines require that the average credit quality of the investment portfolio is typically aa aa and that no more than of the investment portfolio s market value shall be invested in securities rated below baa bbb 
as of december   all of the fixed maturity investments were investment grade  with a weighted average credit rating of aa based on ratings assigned by s p 
our total available for sale and cash and cash equivalents totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  this included restricted cash at december  and of million and million 
the decrease in these total invested assets was due to the payment of losses  general and administrative expenses and reinsurance payables offset by the receipt of premium receivable  net investment income and reinsurance recoverables 
our insurance and reinsurance premiums receivable balances totaled million as of december  compared to million at december  the decrease in premiums receivable reflects the collection of outstanding premiums  cancellations of policies  the impact of am best s downgrades on our ability to write business and our decision to cease underwriting or seeking new business and to place most of our remaining specialty insurance and reinsurance lines into orderly run off during the second quarter of  offset in part by net premiums written during the twelve months ended december  included in our premiums receivable of million are approximately million of written premium installme nts that  on december  were not yet due under the terms of the related insurance and reinsurance contracts 
based on our review of the remaining balance of million  which represents premium installments that were due to us on december   we have established a provision for uncollectible premiums receivable of million 
our deferred acquisition costs and unearned premiums  net of deferred reinsurance premiums  totaled million and million as of december  compared to million and 
table of contents million as of december  the decrease in our deferred acquisition costs and in unearned premiums  net of deferred reinsurance is due to lower premiums written  as a result of the am best s ratings downgrade and our decision to cease underwriting or seeking new business and to place most of our remaining specialty insurance and reinsurance lines into orderly run off 
these amounts represent premiums and acquisition expenses on written contracts of insurance and reinsurance that will be recognized in earnings in future periods 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance recoverable  totaled million as december  compared to million as of december  the increase in our net loss and loss expense reserves reflects our net losses and loss expenses incurred during the year ended december   including adverse development of million excluding reinstatement premiums resulting from the hurricanes and of million related to the oil pipeline claim and losses of million resulting from tornadoes 
the increase was also driven by the number of historical insurance contracts we entered into and the associated net premiums earned  as well as greater reinsurance recoveries relat ive to our payment of losses during the period 
the increase in our net loss and loss expense was mitigated  in part  by net favorable loss developments of approximately million in several of our product lines in which actual loss experience in maturing accident periods was better than expected 
our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses as of december  includes our estimate of gross and net unpaid loss expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  totaling million and million relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and million and million relating to the claim related to the oil pipeline claim that occured in our estimate of our unpaid exposure to ultimate claim costs associated with these losses is based on currently available information  claim notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a review of affected contracts and discussions with clients and others 
the actual amount of future loss payment s relating to these loss events may vary significantly from this estimate 
in we commuted several assumed reinsurance contracts and reduced our gross loss and loss expense reserves by million 
of our total gross losses and expense reserves of million as of december  approximately million or is represented by our estimate of incurred but not reported reserves 
however  we have participated in lines of business where claims may not be reported for some period of time after those claims are incurred 
our reinsurance recoverables as of december  totaled million  of which million had been submitted to our reinsurers for payment  which included million that was due on december   compared to reinsurance recoverables as of december  of million 
the increase in our reinsurance recoverable balance reflects our losses and loss expenses recoverable from reinsurers during the year ended december  as of december   our reinsurance recoverable balances also include our estimate of unpaid loss expenses recoverable totaling million relating to hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma and million relating to the oil pipeline claim that we incurred during the year ended d ecember  our estimate of our reinsurance recoverable balance associated with these losses is based on currently available information  claim notifications received to date  industry loss estimates  output from industry models  a detailed review of affected ceded reinsurance contracts and an assessment of the credit risk to which we are subject 
the actual amount of future loss receipts relating to these loss events may vary significantly from this estimate 
the average credit rating of our reinsurers as of december  is a excellent by am best

our shareholders equity was million as of december  compared to million as of december   reflecting a decrease of million that was primarily the result of a net loss to common shareholders of million for the year ended december  partially offset by the net change in unrealized gains on our investment portfolios of million 
as of december   we have provided a cumulative valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
these deferred tax assets were generated primarily from net operating losses 
as a company in which most of its business is in orderly run off  the realization of these deferred tax assets is neither assur ed nor accurately determinable

the debt to total capital ratio is calculated as the sum of the revolving credit facility  junior subordinated debentures and redeemable preferred shares  or total debt  divided by the sum of total debt and total shareholders equity  or total capitalization 
upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  the holders of our series a preferred shares will be entitled to receive from our assets legally available for distribution to shareholders a liquidation preference of per share  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date fixed for distribution 
dividends on our series a preferred shares will be payable on a non cumulative basis only when  as and if declared by our board of directors  quarterly in arrears on the fifteenth day of march  june  september and december of each year  commencing on march  dividends declared on our series a preferred shares will be payable at a rate equal to of the liquidation preference per annum equival ent to per share 
on and after december   we may redeem our series a preferred shares  in whole or in part  at any time  at the redemption price set forth in the certificate of designation relating to preferred shares  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption 
we may not redeem our series a preferred shares before december  except that we may redeem our series a preferred shares before that date pursuant to certain tax redemption provisions described in the certificate of designation 
if we experience a change of control  we may be required to make offers to redeem our series a preferred shares at a price of per share  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amount s  if any  to the date of redemption and on the terms described in the certificate of designation 
our series a preferred shares have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into any of our other securities or property 
as of december   we have capital that is subject to regulation in following jurisdictions approximately million in bermuda  approximately million in the uk lloyd s and the financial services authority  approximately million in the united states mainly in colorado and in indiana  and approximately million in the european union jurisdiction unrelated to lloyd s and subject to the jurisdiction of the irish financial services regulatory authority 
the balance of our capital of approximately million is held in our other non insurance regulated subsidiaries 
extraction of this capital is subject to a number of restrictions as described above 
liquidity operating cashflow  cash and cash equivalents we used net operating cash flow of approximately million during the year ended december   primarily related to premiums and investment income received offset by losses and loss expenses as well as general and administrative expenses paid 
in addition  we also generated net proceeds from the issuance of our preferred shares of million 
during the same period  we used net cash of million in our investment activities 
this amount includes million of cash received from the sale of esc 
our cash flows from operations for the year ended december  provided us with sufficient liquidity to meet operating cash requirements during that period 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of approximately million 
we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances include approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
after giving effect to these assets pledged or placed in trust  we estimate that we presently have unrestricted net investments of million  including net cash and cash 
table of contents equivalents of approximately million 
of the million  approximately million represents net unrestricted investments held by our operating subsidiaries of which approximately million is held by quanta bermuda 
additionally  quanta indemnity company  quanta specialty lines insurance company and quanta reinsurance us ltd  which are subsidiaries of quanta bermuda  hold approximately million of net unrestricted investments 
the remaining amount of the net unrestricted investments balance is held by quanta europe 
any distributions from these subsidiaries are subject to significant legal  regulatory and compliance requirements 
we believe our operating subsidiaries currently have sufficient assets to pay their respective foreseen liabilities as they become due 
we are working and will  over time  continue to work with applicable regulatory authorities to facilitate dividends or capital return from our insurance subsidiaries to quanta holdings 
working with these regulators takes time and will require us to meet many conditions 
sources of cash our sources of cash consist primarily of existing cash and cash equivalents  premiums written  proceeds from sales and redemptions of investment assets  capital or debt issuances  investment income  reinsurance recoveries  and  to a lesser extent  our secured bank credit facility and collections of receivables for technical services rendered to third parties 
as a result of the am best rating actions in  the resulting loss of business and business opportunities  our decision to cease writing new business in all our product lines  excluding business written at lloyd s  cash flows associated with the receipt of premiums written in our run off segments will continue to decrease substantially 
the cash flows from discontinued operations are combined  in the statement of cash flows  with the cash flows from continuing operations within each category 
we do not expect the absence of cash flows from our discontinued operations to significantly affect our future liquidity and capital resources 
the am best rating action discussed above caused a default under our credit facility led by jpmorgan the jpmorgan credit facility during the lenders waived the default under the jpmorgan credit facility until october  and on that date we entered into a new credit facility described below 
we have started to transition all of the outstanding letters of credit  which secure our claims obligations  from the jpmorgan credit facility to the credit facility described below 
as of december   we had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding under the jpmorgan credit facility  which are fully secured by a letter of credit issued by the ing credit facility described b elow 
these letters of credit are principally used to secure our obligations to pay claims 
on october   we entered into a credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders and ing bank nv  london branch  as the mandated lead arranger  providing for a secured bank letter of credit facility the ing credit facility 
the ing credit facility provides for an aggregate commitment of million for a period of three years terminating on october  we have elected to reduce the aggregate commitment under the ing facility to million as of february  under the ing credit facility  the lenders will issue from time to time  for the account of the designated subsidiary borrowers  one or more back to back letters of credit naming jpmorgan chase bank  na as beneficiary in the face amount equal to the face amount of the outstanding letters of credit under the jpmorgan credit facility  and other letters of credit in an aggregate face amount up to the aggregate commitment 
the facility is secured by specified investments of the borrowers 
availability for issuances of letters of credit on account of any borrower is based on the amount of eligible investments pledged by the applicable borrower s and no material adverse change provisions 
regulatory restrictions will also limit the a mount of investments that may be pledged by certain us insurance borrowers and  consequently  the amount available for letters of credit under the facility on account of those borrowers 
quanta holdings unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed all of the obligations of our subsidiaries to the lenders under the ing credit facility 
the ing credit facility includes customary representations and warranties  affirmative and negative covenants  and events of default 
the ing credit facility has a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth  as well as covenants restricting our activities  such as the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  the sale of assets  and the payment of dividends and other restricted payments 

table of contents on october   we also entered into a fourth consent and amendment to credit agreement the fourth amendment to the jpmorgan credit facility 
the fourth amendment  among other things  permanently terminates the lenders obligations to extend any loan  issue any letter of credit  modify the terms of any existing letter of credit  or otherwise extend any additional credit under the jpmorgan credit facility  releases the liens granted by us and our designated subsidiary borrowers and transfers the collateral to the collateral agent under the ing credit facility in exchange for a letter of credit issued pursuant to the ing credit facility in a stated principal amount equal to of the letters of credit ou tstanding under the jpmorgan credit facility 
furthermore  the fourth amendment reduces certain fees payable under the jpmorgan credit facility and permanently removes most of the covenants contained in the jpmorgan credit facility  including the covenants mandating a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated net worth  restrictions against the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  dividends and other restricted payments  and the requirement that we maintain certain insurance ratings 
uses of cash and liquidity as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of approximately million 
we estimate that our cash and cash equivalents and investment balances include approximately million that is pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
within our corporate structure  some of our subsidiaries also owe and are owed amounts to and from each other 
for example  at december  quanta holdings owed approximately million to quanta bermuda 
after giving effect to assets pledged or placed in trust  we estimate that we have net unrestricted investments of million  including net cash of approximately million 
of the million  approximately million represents net unrestricted investments held by our operating subsidiaries of which approximately million is held by quanta bermuda 
additionally  quanta indemnity company  quanta specialty lines insurance company and quanta reinsurance us ltd  which are subsidiaries of quanta bermuda  hold approximately million of net unrestricted investments 
the remaining amount of the net unrestricted investments balance is held by quanta europe 
any distributions from these subsidiaries are subjec t to significant legal  regulatory and compliance requirements and may require the settlements of any applicable intercompany debts 
we believe our operating subsidiaries currently have sufficient assets to pay their respective foreseen liabilities as they become due 
substantially all of our capital has been distributed among our rated operating subsidiaries based on our assessment of the levels of capital that we believe are prudent to support our business  the applicable regulatory requirements  and the recommendations of the insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
some of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contain termination rights that were triggered by the am best rating action 
some of these insurance and reinsurance contracts also required us to post additional security either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
we may also elect to post security under other insurance contracts in order to maintain that business 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalent and investment balances of approximately million that were available to post as security or place in trust 
in the near term  our other principal cash requirements are expected to be losses and loss adjustment expenses and other policy holder benefits  including those related to policy cancellations and commutations  brokerage and commissions in our lloyd s business  expenses to implement our run off plans  including legal  professional  severance and incentive payments  other operating expenses  premiums ceded  capital expenditures  the servicing of borrowing arrangements and taxes 
we may also be required or choose to place capital in our operating subsidiaries 
following our restructured investment in syndicate we are committed to provide up to of the syndicate s 
table of contents capital requirements for the  and underwriting years of account 
although this capital requirement is capped at the amount of our actual funds at lloyd s in place on the date lloyd s finalizes the capital requirements of syndicate for each underwriting year  we may in certain circumstances be required to place additional funds at lloyd s prior to these dates 
any dividend payments on our series a preferred shares are payable by our holding company  quanta holdings 
quanta holdings is dependent on dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to satisfy these obligations and the obligations under our trust preferred securities 
the potential for a large claim under one of our insurance or reinsurance contracts means that we may need to make substantial and unpredictable payments within relatively short periods of time 
as a result of our decision to cease underwriting or seeking new business and to place most of our remaining specialty insurance and reinsurance lines into orderly run off  we have incurred substantial costs  including severance payments  in connection with the implementation of any changes based on such decision 
this decision also involves significant risks that may result in restructuring charges and unforeseen expenses and costs associated with exiting lines of business and complications or delays  including  among others things  the risk of failure 
during the year ended december   we have incurred severance charges of million 
additionally  we have entered into agreements with james j 
ritchie  peter d 
johnson and jonathan jr dodd  and a number of other key employees that provide for specified severance payments in the event of termination without cause or following a change of control 
in the event of payout to all employees covered by these agreements  our cash requirements would include payments in an aggregate amount of up to approximately million to all such employees 
of this amount  million has been recognized within our severance charges of million 
we expect that our cash requirements for the payment of claims will be significant in future periods as we receive and settle claims  including those relating to the claims for the hurricanes that occurred in we incurred capital expenditures of million during the year ended december  as we continue to manage the run off of our specialty insurance and reinsurance business other than our lloyd s business  we are unable to quantify the amounts of future capital expenditures we may have to incur 
while insurance regulation differs by location  each jurisdiction requires that minimum levels of capital be maintained in order to write new insurance business 
factors that affect capital requirements generally include premium volume  the extent and nature of loss and loss expense reserves  the type and form of insurance and reinsurance business underwritten and the availability of reinsurance protection from adequately rated retrocessionaires on terms that are acceptable to us 
these regulatory requirements restrict the amount of capital we are able to distribute to quanta holdings and other insurance subsidiaries 
for further discussion  see adequacy of regulatory and rating capital 
substant ially all of our capital has been distributed among our subsidiaries based on our assessment of the levels of capital that we believed were prudent to support the levels of expected business we had at the time  the applicable regulatory requirements  and the recommendations of the insurance regulatory authorities and rating agencies 
dividends and redemptions quanta holdings depends on future dividends and other permitted payments from its subsidiaries to pay any dividends 
further  our ability to pay dividends  is subject to regulatory and contractual constraints  including the terms of the ing credit facility that prohibits us from repurchasing series a preferred shares without the consent of our lenders 
we will work with applicable regulatory authorities to facilitate dividends or capital return from our subsidiaries to quanta holdings 
we anticipate that  in all cases  the paying of dividends or capital return to quanta holdings will require regulatory approval 
working with these regulators will take a long period of time and requires the company to meet many conditions 
the ing credit facility  as well as any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness  also contains provisions prohibiting or limiting the payment of dividends on our shares under certain circumstances 

table of contents if we experience a change of control  we may be required to make offers to redeem our series a preferred shares at a price of per share  plus declared but unpaid dividends and additional amounts  if any  to the date of redemption and on the terms described in the certificate of designation 
our series a preferred shares have no stated maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund and are not convertible into any of our other securities or property 
we are also subject to bermuda regulatory constraints that affect our ability to pay dividends on our shares  redeem our series a preferred shares and make other payments 
under the companies act  even though we are solvent and able to pay our liabilities as they become due  we may not declare or pay a dividend or make a distribution if we have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or will after the payment be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or if the realizable value of our assets will thereby be less than the aggregate of our liabilities and our issued share capital and share premium accounts

the interest on the long term debt obligation is based on a spread above libor 
we have reflected the interest due based upon the current interest rate at december  on the facility 
our reserve for losses and loss expenses consists of case reserves and ibnr 
in assessing the adequacy of these reserves  it must be noted that the actual costs of settling claims is uncertain as it depends upon future events 
many of these events will be out of our control and could potentially affect the ultimate liability and timing of any potential payment 
there is necessarily a range of possible outcomes and the eventual outcome will certainly differ from the projections currently made 
this uncertainty is heightened by the short time in which we have operated  thereby providing limited 
table of contents company specific claims loss emergence patterns 
consequently  we must use industry benchmarks  on a line by line basis  in deriving ibnr which  despite management s and our independent actuary s care in selecting them  will differ from actual experience 
similarly  we have limited loss payout pattern information specific to our experience  therefore we have used industry data  on a line by line basis  to estimate our expected payments 
consequently  despite management s care in selecting them  the actual payment of our reserve for losses and loss expenses will differ from estimated payouts 
off balance sheet arrangements other than as described under liquidity related to our trust preferred securities offerings through the quanta trust i and quanta trust ii together quanta trust i and ii  as of december   we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements with special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
we did not consolidate quanta trust i and ii  the issuer of the trust preferred securities and a variable interest entity  since we are not the primary beneficiary of quanta trust i or ii 
as of december   we have recorded the million of debentures  which were issued to quanta trust i and ii  on our consolidated balance sheet 
the net proceeds of million from the sale of the debentures to quanta trust i and ii were used for working capital purposes and our business 
distributions will be payable at a variable per annum rate of interest  reset quarterly  equal to libor plus basis points by the company to quanta trust i and equal to libor plus basis points by the company to quanta trust ii as described above under commitments 
the debentures are redeemable at the company s option at par beginning march  posting of security by our non us operating subsidiaries our bermuda  united kingdom  and irish operating subsidiaries are not licensed  accredited or otherwise approved as reinsurers anywhere in the united states 
many us jurisdictions do not permit insurance companies to take credit on their us statutory financial statements for reinsurance to cover unpaid liabilities  such as loss and loss adjustment expense and unearned premium reserves  obtained from unlicensed or non admitted insurers without appropriate security acceptable to us insurance commissioners 
typically  this type of security will take the form of a letter of credit issued by an acceptable bank  the establishment of a trust  funds withheld or a combination of these elements 
as described under liquidity above we entered into the ing credit facility providing for the issuance of letters of credit for a period of three years terminating on october  regulatory restrictions also limit the amount of investments that may be pledged by our us insurance borrowers and  consequently  the amount available for letters of credit and borrowings under the facility to those borrowers 
as of december   we had approximately million of secured letters of credit issued and outstanding 
if we fail to maintain or enter into adequate letter of credit facilities on a timely basis  we may be unable to provide necessary security to cedent companies that have the right to re quire the posting of additional security by reason of the downgrade of our am best rating 
as of december   we have approximately million that was pledged as collateral for letters of credit  approximately million held in trust funds for the benefit of ceding companies and to fund our obligations associated with the assumption of an environmental remediation liability  million that is held by lloyd s to support our underwriting activities  million held in trust funds that are related to our deposit liabilities and million that is on deposit with  or has been pledged to  us state insurance departments 
some of our insurance and many of our reinsurance contracts contain termination rights that were triggered by the am best rating downgrade 
some of these insurance and reinsurance contracts also require us to post additional security 
as a result  we may be required to post additional security either through the issuance of letters of credit or the placement of securities in trust under the terms of those insurance or reinsurance contracts 
we may also elect to post security under other insurance 
table of contents contracts 
we currently have net cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately million that are available to post as security or place in trust 
however  the distribution of these funds from each of our operating subsidiaries is subject to significant legal  regulatory and compliance requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements contain certain amounts that are inherently subjective in nature and require management to make certain judgments  estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting policies used to determine inherently subjective amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the use of different assumptions and estimates could produce materially different estimates of the reported amounts 
in addition  if actual events differ materially from management s assumptions used in applying the relevant accounting policy  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and liquidity 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect significant estimates used now or to be used in the future in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
premiums written  ceded and earned the method by which we record and recognize premiums written differs based upon the nature of the underlying insurance or reinsurance contract 
insurance premiums written are generally defined in the associated policies  are recorded on the inception date of the policies and are earned over the terms of the policies in proportion to the amount of insurance protection provided 
typically this results in the earning of premium on a pro rata as to time basis over the term of the related insurance coverage 
reinsurance premiums written are recorded based on the type of the associated reinsurance contract 
typically  we write losses occurring and risks attaching contracts on a single year basis 
we may on occasion write multi year reinsurance contracts 
losses occurring reinsurance contracts cover losses that occur during the term of the reinsurance contract 
risks attaching contracts cover claims that arise on underlying insurance policies that incept during the term of the reinsurance contract 
reinsurance premiums written are earned on a pro rata over time basis over the expected term of the contract  typically months for losses occurring contracts 
premiums written on risks attaching reinsurance contracts are recorded in the pe riod in which the underlying policies or risks are expected to incept 
premiums earned on risks attaching contracts usually extend beyond the original term of the reinsurance contract resulting in recognition of premium earnings over an extended period  typically months 
reinsurance premiums on multi year losses occurring reinsurance contracts that are payable in annual installments are recorded as premiums written on an annual basis at inception and on the contract anniversary dates if the reinsured has the ability to cancel  commute or change the coverage during the contract term or if the contract provides for varying amounts of reinsurance coverage for each annual period for which there is a specified premium installment 
reinsurance premiums written on certain types of contracts  notably treaty quota share contracts  may not be known definitively on the inception date of the contract and therefore include estimates of premiums written 
these estimates are based on data provided by the ceding companies or brokers  our underwriters judgment and underlying economic conditions 
a key assumption used in our estimates of reinsurance premiums written is the estimate of the amount of the ceding companies underlying subject premium written  and in some cases  earned during any reporting period 
our estimates of written premiums are re evaluated over the term of the contract period as underwriting information becomes available and as actual pr emiums are reported by the ceding companies or brokers 
for certain excess of loss reinsurance contracts we record the minimum premium  as defined in the contract  as our estimated premium written at inception of the contract 
subsequent changes to 
table of contents our premium estimates are recorded as adjustments to premiums written and premiums receivable in the period in which they become known and could be material 
adjustments may significantly impact net income  our financial position and liquidity in the period in which they are determined  particularly when the subject contract is fully or substantially expired resulting in the premium adjustment being fully or substantially earned 
at december  our premiums receivable included approximately million of estimated reinsurance premiums receivable 
some of our written and ceded contracts include retrospective rating provisions  including profit commissions  no claims bonuses and reinstatement premiums that adjust estimated premiums or acquisition expenses based upon experience and underwriting results 
profit commissions are expenses that vary with and are directly related to acquiring new and renewal insurance and reinsurance business 
profit commission accruals are recorded in acquisition costs and are adjusted at the end of each reporting period based on the experience of the underlying contract 
no claims bonuses are accrued as a reduction of earned premiums and are adjusted at the end of each reporting period based on the experience of the underlying contract 
we also w rite certain structured insurance and reinsurance contracts as risk management solutions that cannot otherwise be provided by traditional contracts 
typically  we assume a measured amount of risk in exchange for a premium  a specified portion of which may be returnable to the insured based on the level of loss experience or underwriting profitability 
adjustments related to retrospective rating provisions that adjust estimated premiums or acquisition expenses are recognized over the remaining contract periods in accordance with the underlying contract terms based on current experience under the contracts 
certain of our written and ceded reinsurance contracts contain provisions that require us to receive or pay additional premiums in the event that losses of a certain magnitude are incurred or ceded under such contracts 
these additional premiums are known as reinstatement premiums that typically reinstate coverage limits under pre defined contract terms 
terms principally include a pro rata amount of the original contract premium relative to the proportion of the contractual limit exhausted by the associated loss  without respect to time remaining in the term of the original limit  that is  the amount due is as to time and pro rata as to amount 
since these reinstatement premiums are triggered and are mandatorily due upon the occurrence of incurred or ceded losses  they are written or ceded and earned or expensed at the time the associated loss event occurs 
the original contract premium is earned over the remaining exposure period of the contract 
during the year ended december   we wrote and earned million of reinstatement premiums written and expensed million of reinstatement premiums ceded associated with the occurrence of the hurricanes 
during  these estimates were adjusted to million and million as losses developed under those contracts that contained reinstatement provisions 
retrospective rating adjustments are necessarily based on underwriting results that include certain estimates relating to premiums and losses  and are therefore subject to adjustment as underwriting experience develops especially in the case of reinstatement premiums 
the primary factor that could change our estimate of reinstatement premiums written and ceded is our best estimate of ultimate losses incurred 
in the normal course of business  we purchase reinsurance or retrocessional coverage in order to increase our underwriting capacity and to limit our individual and aggregate exposures to risks of losses arising from the contracts of insurance or reinsurance that we underwrite 
reinsurance premiums ceded to reinsurers are recorded and recognized in a manner consistent with the terms of reinsurance agreement and the related premiums written under the original reinsured contracts or policies 
premiums written and ceded relating to the unexpired periods of coverage or policy terms are recorded as unearned premium reserves and deferred reinsurance premiums  respectively 
in the normal course of our operations  we may have entered into certain contracts that do not meet the risk transfer provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts sfas for financial reporting purposes either due to insufficient underwriting risk or insufficient timing risk that do not provide indemnification for insurance accounting under sfas 
table of contents no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises sfas 
for these contracts we follow the deposit method of accounting as prescribed in american institute of certified public accountants  known as the aicpa  statement of position  deposit accounting accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer insurance risk sop 
the deposit method of accounting requires that the premium we receive or pay  less any explicitly defined margins or fees retained or paid  are accounted for as deposit asset or deposit liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
explicitly defined fees retained or paid are deferred and recognized in other income in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income according to the nature of the product or service provided 
for those contracts that transfer significant underwriting risk only and for reinsurance contracts where it is not reasonably possible that we can realize a significant loss even though we assume significant insurance risk  the deposit asset or liability is measured based on the unexpired portion of the coverage provided 
the deposit asset or liability is adjusted for any losses incurred or recoverable based on the present value of the expected future cash flows arising from the loss event with the adjustment being recorded in net losses and loss expenses within our results of operations 
for those contracts that transfer neither significant underwriting risk nor significant timing risk and for contracts that transfer significant timing risk only  the deposit asset or liability is adjusted  and corresponding interest income or expense recognized within our results of operations  by using the interest method to calculate the effective yield on the deposit based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows 
if a change in the actual or estimated timing or amount of cash flows occurs  the effective yield is recalculated and the deposit is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the inception of the insurance or reinsurance contract 
the adjustment is recorded a s interest income or interest expense 
non traditional contracts we wrote non traditional contracts of insurance and reinsurance that were deemed not to meet risk transfer criteria and accordingly we have accounted for these transactions as deposits held on behalf of clients 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized in other income million and million of fees and revenues relating to non traditional contracts which were accounted for using the deposit method 
if these contracts were deemed to transfer risk  gross premium relating to these contracts would total approximately million and million in the years ended december  and of the million and million  million and million of other income related to non traditional contracts recognized during the years ended december  and relate to fees earned from a surplus relief life reinsurance arrangement with a us insurance company that meets our definition of a non traditional contract 
as of december  and  we have provided approximately million unaudited and million unaudited of statutory surplus relief to the us insurance company under this contract 
in the fourth quarter of  under this contract we entered into an arrangement with a client and assumed  through novation agreements  several life reinsurance contracts it had made 
the clien t  which is subject to insurance regulation in the united states and therefore is required to maintain a certain amount of statutory capital  may reduce its statutory capital requirements 
in exchange for our assumption of the contracts we received a fee 
the arrangement  among other things  provides that on certain dates and during specific periods  the client has the right but not the obligation to recapture the life reinsurance contracts we assumed  provided that the underlying cedants do not reasonably withhold their consent to this recapture 
we believe that the client is economically incentivized to exercise the recapture provision in the future  as the amount of expected profit on the underlying life reinsurance contracts emerges over time 
we believe the arrangement  including the client s option to recapture  and the assumption of the life insurance contracts constitute one contract with minimal mortality  credit or other insurance or economic risk which results in deposit accounting 
although we believe the client will exercise the recapture  it is not assured that this will be the case 
if the client does not recapture the underlying insurance contracts in the future  we may be viewed as having had the risks described above and  as a 
table of contents result  we could be deemed to have retained life reinsurance risk and  as a result  may be required to account for some or all of the underlying insurance contracts as life insurance  recognizing life premiums written and life benefit reserves in the consolidated statement of operations 
if deposit accounting had not been used with respect to this particular arrangement  we would have recognized gross life reinsurance premiums written of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and at this time  we believe that the recognition of these premiums written would not have had a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
however  as the underlying life insurance contracts mature the effect on our financial condition and results of operations may become material 
in respect of life reinsurance arrangements written on a coinsurance basis  where investment assets have been transferred to us  such assets have been recorded within our trading investment portfolio and are separately presented as investments related to deposit liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
a deposit liability has been recorded in the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments for non risk investment contracts as an interest bearing instrument using the effective yield method 
the investments related to the deposit liability are held in trust funds and are pledged to the ceding companies 
in respect of the life reinsurance arrangements written on a modified coinsurance basis  the ceding company s net statutory reserves and assets are withheld and remain legally owned by the ceding company 
these modified coinsurance contracts represent non cash financial reinsurance transactions  whereby  in accordance with the contract terms  there are no net cash flows at inception of contracts  nor are there expected to be net cash flows through the life of the contracts  other than our explicitly defined fees 
notional contract assets and liabilities contemplated by the contract terms are offset in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpret ation no 
fin offsetting of amounts related to certain contracts and as such we do not present such assets or deposit liabilities in its consolidated balance sheet 
certain of our coinsurance and modified coinsurance agreements may contain provisions that qualify as embedded derivatives under derivatives implementation group issue no 
b embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposures that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments dig issue b the value of embedded derivatives in these contracts is currently considered immaterial 
we monitor the performance of these treaties on a quarterly basis 
significant adverse performance or changes in our expectations of future cashflows on these treaties could resul t in losses associated with the embedded derivative 
of the million and million  million and million of other income recognized during the years ended december  and relate to explicitly defined margins on one short duration contract written by our specialty reinsurance segment that does not meet the risk transfer provisions of sfas this contract was written on a funds withheld basis  such that the deposit liability of million and million recorded is equal to a funds withheld asset according to the contract terms 
in accordance with fin  the funds withheld asset and the deposit liability have been offset in the consolidated balance sheet 
the remaining million and million of other income derived from non traditional contracts recognized during the years ended december  and relates to revenues earned from five and five reinsurance contracts accounted for as deposits 
although these contracts did possess some underwriting and timing risks as prescribed by sfas no 
 we do not believe we are exposed to a reasonable possibility of significant loss 
included in the remaining million and million of other income are million and million related to one surplus relief life reinsurance agreement 
underlying treaties attach to this contract on a coinsurance basis 
as of december  and  we have provided approximately million unaudited and million unaudited of statutory surplus relief to a us insurance company under this contract 

table of contents acquisition expenses and ceding commission income acquisition costs are policy issuance related costs that vary with and are directly related to the acquisition of new and renewal insurance and reinsurance business  and primarily consist of commissions  third party brokerage and insurance premium taxes 
ceding commission income consists of commissions we receive on insurance and reinsurance business that we cede to our reinsurers 
typically acquisition costs and commission income are based on a fixed percentage of the premium written or ceded 
this percentage varies for each line or class of business and each type of contract written 
acquisition expenses and commission income are recorded and deferred at the time premium is written or ceded and are subsequently amortized in earn ings as the premiums to which they relate are earned or expensed 
acquisition expenses are reflected in the consolidated statement of operations net of ceding commission income from our reinsurers 
acquisition costs relating to unearned premiums are deferred in the balance sheet as deferred acquisition costs net of commission income relating to deferred reinsurance premiums ceded 
net deferred acquisition costs are carried at their estimated realizable value and are limited to the amount expected to be recovered from future net earned premiums and anticipated investment income 
any limitation is referred to as a premium deficiency 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of our anticipated losses  loss expenses and unamortized acquisition costs exceeds the recorded unearned premium reserve and anticipated net investment income 
a premium deficiency is recognized by charging any deferred acquisition costs to acquisition expenses to the extent required to eliminate the deficiency 
if the deficiency exceeds the deferred acquisition cost asset then a liability is accrued within loss and loss expense reserves for the excess deficiency 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance assets due from our reinsurers under the terms of ceded reinsurance contracts include unpaid loss recoveries  loss and loss expense reserves recoverable and deferred reinsurance premiums 
we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurance ceded because the ceding of risk does not relieve us from our obligations to our insureds 
to the extent our reinsurers default  we must settle these obligations without the benefit of reinsurance protection 
failure of our reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in credit losses 
if the financial condition of any of our reinsurers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments to us  we establish allowances for amounts considered potentially uncolle ctible from such reinsurers 
we evaluate the financial condition of our reinsurers and monitor concentrations of credit risk arising from similar geographic regions  activities  or economic characteristics of our reinsurers to minimize our exposure to losses from reinsurer insolvencies 
as of december   our reinsurance recoverables recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were million  of which approximately  and were due from three reinsurers of which one was rated a and two were rated a by am best 
deferred tax valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized from future anticipated taxable income 
as of december   our net deferred tax assets were million against which we provided a valuation allowance on the basis that  given our limited operating history  the realization of deferred tax assets from our anticipated future taxable income is neither assured nor accurately determinable 
if we subsequently assess that the valuation allowance  or any portion thereof  is no longer required an income tax benefit will be recorded in net income in the period in which such assessment is made 
investments our publicly traded and non publicly traded fixed maturity  short term investments and equity securities that are classified as available for sale are recorded at estimated fair value with the 
table of contents difference between cost or amortized cost and fair value  net of the effect of taxes  included as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheet to the extent that unrealized losses are considered temporary 
our publicly traded and non publicly traded fixed maturity and short term investments that are classified as trading are recorded at estimated fair value with the change in fair value included in net realized gains on investments in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss income 
short term investments include highly liquid debt instruments and commercial paper that are generally due within one year of the date of purchase and are held as part of our investment portfolios that are managed by independent investment managers 
the fair value of publicly traded securities is based upon quoted market prices 
the estimated fair value of non publicly traded securities is based on independent third party pricing sources 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we periodically review our investments to determine whether an impairment  being a decline in fair value of a security below its amortized cost  is other than temporary 
if such a decline is classified as other than temporary  we would write down  to fair value  the impaired security resulting in a new cost basis of the security and the amount of the write down would be charged to the statement of operations and comprehensive loss income as a realized loss 
the new cost basis would not be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
some of the factors that we consider in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary include the amount of the impairment  the period of time for which the fair value has been below the amortized cost  specific reasons or market conditions which could affect the security  including the financial condition of the issuer and relevant industry conditions or rating agency actions  and our ability and intent to hold the security for sufficient time to allow for possible recovery 
investments are recorded on a trade date basis 
our net investment income is recognized when earned and consists primarily of interest  the accrual of discount or amortization of premium on fixed maturity securities and dividends  and is net of investment management and custody expenses 
gains and losses realized on the sale of investments are determined on the first in  first out basis 
capitalization of software costs we capitalize software costs when the preliminary project stage is completed and management commits to fund the software project which it deems probable will be completed and used to perform the intended function 
this policy is in accordance with aicpa statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop 
software costs that are capitalized include only external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing  or obtained for internal use computer software 
we cease the capitalization of costs as soon as the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose 
we review the carrying value of capitalized software costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable  and a loss is recognized when the value of estimated undiscounted cash flow benefit related to the asset falls below the unamortized cost 
reserve for losses and loss expenses as an insurance and reinsurance company we are required  under us gaap and applicable insurance regulations  to establish reserves for losses and loss expenses for estimates of future amounts to be paid in settlement of our ultimate liabilities for claims arising under the terms of written insurance and reinsurance policies that have occurred at or before the balance sheet date 
under us gaap  we are only permitted to establish loss and loss expense reserves for actual losses that have occurred before the balance sheet date 
we do not record contingency reserves for expected future loss occurrences  nor do we discount our reserves for losses and loss expenses to be paid in the future 
we believe that the estimation of future ultimate loss liabilities is the most significant judgment made by management and is inherently subject to significant accounting uncertainties 
these uncertainties are driven by many variables that are difficult to quantify and include

our own historical claim experiences because of our limited operating history 
a significant uncertainty in our estimation of loss and loss expense reserves involves our estimates of catastrophe losses 
in reserving for catastrophe losses  our estimates are influenced by underwriting information provided by our clients  industry catastrophe models  industry loss estimates and our internal analyses of this information 
reliance on this information can cause significant development from initial loss estimates in the immediate wake of a catastrophe event due to the limited information available and the volatility in that information 
this process can cause our ultimate estimates to differ significantly from initial projections 
the hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter of present an example of the uncertainty and potential variability associated with reserving for catastrophe losses 
as of september   we initially based our reserves to a significant degree on our knowledge about the industry loss estimates of the total loss and we also considered what we believed to be similar historical events such as the hurricanes 
we used this information and data in conjunction with a review of the majority of the underlying affected contracts in assessing initial loss and loss expense reserves 
at september   our initial estimated ultimate net loss and loss expense was approximately million  net of reinstatement premiums 
as of december  our updated estimate of ultimate net loss and loss expenses is approximately million  which represents a increase over the fifteen month period following september  we believe that industry loss estimates published during october and november totaled approximately billion  excluding costs associated with marin e offshore energy claims 
by december  we believe that these estimates had increased by to billion 
given that our catastrophe exposed business has been a very small proportion of the total market  we do not expect that changes in our loss estimates will be closely correlated to changes in industry loss estimates 
we have a system of controls in place that assists us in our loss estimation process and the evaluation of the completeness of the data received from our clients and others 
these controls include the use of employed actuaries who are experienced in the lines of business we have underwritten  the requirement to obtain up to date information from our clients or brokers  the use of several actuarial methodologies to calculate estimated losses in each of our product lines  the use of industry data for large or well known losses  the right to perform claims audits of our clients and the requirement that our underwriters or loss adjusters contact our clients and brokers directly if he or she did not expect a loss of certain magnitude 
we have established a large loss committee that is tasked with the review of all claims in excess of a certain amount and we also require that certain claims must be approved by a member of senior management to validate the reported loss and case reserve 
in addition  our loss and loss expense estimates  data and reserving assumptions are reviewed annually by an independent recognized actuarial firm 
the estimation of unpaid loss liabilities is also affected by the type or structure of the policies we have written 
in the case of our direct insurance business we often assume risks for which we believe 
table of contents claims experience tends to be frequency driven 
as a result  historical loss development data may be available and traditional actuarial methods of loss estimation may be used 
conversely  the available amount of relevant loss experience that we can use to quantify the emergence  severity and payout characteristics of the loss liabilities is limited for policies that are written with the expectation that potential losses will be characterized by lower frequency but higher severity claims  such as contracts written that are exposed to natural catastrophes or other significant sudden and accidental events 
as a result  incurred losses are inherently more volatile in our product lines exposed to these types of losses  such as property and marine reinsurance 
the estimation of unpaid loss liabilities will also vary in subjectivity depending on the tail of incurred losses which we typically analyze between short tail and long tail businesses 
short tail business describes lines of business for which losses become known and paid in a relatively short period time after the loss actually occurs 
typically  there will be less variability caused by the tail in the ultimate amount of losses from claims incurred in the short tail lines that we have written such as technical risk property  property  marine and aviation 
long tail business describes lines of business for which actual losses may not be known for some time or for which the actual amount of loss may take a significantly longer peri od of time to emerge or develop 
our casualty  professional and environmental lines of business are generally considered longer tail in nature 
because loss emergence and settlement periods can be many years in duration  these lines of business are more likely to have significant variability in the estimates of their loss and loss expense reserves 
we establish loss and loss expense reserves to cover expenses related to settling claims  including legal and other fees to provide for the ultimate cost of settlement and administration of claims for incurred losses 
our loss and loss expense reserves fall into two categories reserves for unpaid reported losses and for losses incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims 
reported claim reserves are based initially on claim reports received from insureds  brokers or ceding companies 
in certain but infrequent instances  such as the receipt of inconsistent  incorrect or inadequate supporting documentation  we may supplement the reported loss with additional ultimate settlement costs assessed by our claims professionals 
ibnr reserves are calculated using a variety of generally accepted statistical and actuarial techniques developed in the insurance industry 
in applying these techniques  we rely on the most recent information available  including pricing information  industry data and on our historical loss and loss expense experience 
where our historical loss information is limited  we increase our reliance on individual pricing analyses and industry loss information to guide our estimates 
we may also utilize commercially available computer models to evaluate future trends and to estimate ultimate claim costs 
from time to time we engage independent external actuarial specialists to review our estimates of loss and loss expense reserves and ou r reserving methods 
even though our reserving techniques are actuarially sound  there may still be significant subsequent adjustments to loss and loss expense reserves due to the nature of our business and the risks written 
in general  the industry accepted ibnr reserving techniques involve the extrapolation of historical or reported loss data to estimate ultimate loss and loss expense reserves 
we generally apply several reserving methodologies in estimating loss and loss expense reserves in each of our product lines 
we typically select the highest reserve estimate generated by each of the methodologies used for each accident year or period of loss occurrence and in making that selection we also consider the maturity of the accident period 
the maturity of the accident period depends upon the nature and tail of the product line being considered 
if the accident period is considered mature we are more likely to select t he actuarial method that places reliance on our own historical reported loss experience compared to an immature accident period where we are more likely to select a method based on initial expected losses with limited consideration to actual historical loss development 
we believe that accident periods in our short tail product lines become mature after six to twelve months 
we believe our long tail product line accident periods mature  for reserving selection purposes  between eighteen months and three years 
as of december  the primary reserving method we used to estimate the ultimate cost of losses for our specialty reinsurance run off lines and our professional  environmental  fidelity and 
table of contents technical risk property specialty insurance run off business lines was the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method for mature accident periods 
the bornhuetter ferguson actuarial method utilizes the expected loss initial expected loss and loss expense ratio multiplied by earned premium multiplied by loss development factors derived by our internal actuaries from our own actual loss and loss expense experience in each product line and also from industry statistics 
as accident periods mature we place more reliance on the bornhuetter ferguson method for which we use both historical paid and historical reported data 
the primary reserving method we used to estimate the ultimate cost of losses for our other immature accident years in our specialty insurance run off business lines and in our lloyd s buinesses was an expected loss ratio methodology whereby earned premiums are multiplied by an expected loss ratio to derive ultimate losses and deducts any paid losses and loss expenses to arrive at estimated losses and loss expense reserves 
this method is commonly applied when there is insufficient historical loss development experience available 
our loss development factors and expected loss ratios are monitored regularly and updated as appropriate but at least once a year 
key assumptions materially affect our estimates for reserves for losses and loss expenses 
our initial expected loss and loss expense ratios for our specialty reinsurance run off business lines is derived from loss exposure information provided by brokers and ceding companies and from loss and loss expense ratios established during the pricing of individual contracts 
our initial expected losses and loss expense ratios selected for our specialty insurance run off lines are based on benchmarks derived by our underwriters and actuaries during the initial pricing of the business and from comparable market information 
our expected loss ratios are periodically adjusted for any information provided by our clients  rating increases and changes in terms and conditions that have been observed in the market 
loss development factors are developed from our annual analysis of our historical loss development patterns by line of business and from available industry data 
these key assumptions did not materially change between december  and december  in the fourth quarter of we transitioned our loss selection method from the expected loss ratio method to the bornhuetter ferguson method for the maturing accident periods in and in our professional insurance product line 
this resulted in our loss ratio selection decreasing from approximately to for these accident periods as a result of favorable historical loss experience 
this had the effect of reducing our net loss reserves by approximately million in the fourth quarter of we believe that our assumptions represent a realistic and appropriate basis for currently estimating our loss and loss expense reserves 
however  given our limited operating history  we believe that our estimates of loss and loss expense reserves may be subject to significant volatility and as our own loss experience begins to develop  we may expand our reserving analyses to include other commonly used methods 
these reserving methods may lead to reserve estimates that are more volatile than those based upon a long  consistent history of our own reported loss experience 
we continually review our reserve estimate and reserving methodologies taking into account all currently known information and updated assumptions related to unknown information 
loss and loss expense reserves established in prior periods are adjusted as claim experience develops and new information becomes available 
any adjustments to previously established reserves  resulting from a change in estimate  may significantly impact current period underwriting results and net income by reducing net income if previous period reserve estimates prove to be deficient or improve net income if prior period reserves become redundant 
losses and loss expense arising from future insured events will be estimated and provided for at the time th e losses are incurred and could be substantial 
at december   approximately  or million of our loss and loss expense reserves  net of reinsurance are based on estimates of incurred but not yet reported losses and as such we believe remain subject to significant volatility 
as of december   a change in our reserves for loss and loss expenses  net of losses and loss adjustment expenses recoverable  of million would equate to a million change in our reserves for loss and loss expenses  which would represent of our net loss for the year ended december  and of our shareholders equity as of december  
table of contents environmental remediation liabilities assumed in our technical services segment we assume environmental liabilities in exchange for remediation fees and contracts to perform the required remediation in accordance with the underlying remediation agreements 
we estimate our initial and ongoing ultimate liabilities for such environmental remediation obligations using actual experience  past experience with similar remediation projects  technical engineering examinations of the contaminated sites and state  local and federal guidelines 
however  we cannot assure you that actual remediation costs will not significantly differ from our estimated amounts 
we continually review our estimates for ultimate remediation costs taking into account all currently known information and update d assumptions related to unknown information 
any adjustments to previously established liabilities  resulting from a change in our estimates  may significantly impact our current period operating results 
as of december   we had assumed two environmental remediation projects for which we have recorded an estimated liability of million 
when we receive consideration for the assumption of a remediation liability that is in excess of our estimate of the related environmental remediation liability  we initially defer the excess amount and record it in deferred income on the consolidated balance sheet 
this deferred remediation revenue is recognized in earnings over the anticipated remediation period using the cost recovery or percentage of completion method that is based on the ratio of remediation expenses actually incurred and paid to total anticipated remediation costs 
as of december   we had deferred approximately million of remediation revenue that was included in deferred income 
technical services revenues technical services revenue is primarily derived from short term technical services arrangements with customers 
generally  technical services revenue is earned in the period for which services are performed 
included in technical services revenue is accrued but unbilled revenue that arises mainly due to a time lag in billing cycle and special billing arrangements with customers 
other accounts receivable the majority of our other accounts receivable balances comprise amounts due under technical services arrangements with customers 
we establish bad debt allowances  or valuation reserves  based on specific identification of likely losses of accounts with individual customers 
we periodically re evaluate these valuation reserve estimates  if any  and adjust them as more information about the ultimate collectibility of accounts receivable becomes available 
circumstances that could cause these valuation reserves to be revised include changes in our clients financial standing such as liquidity and credit quality  and other factors that negatively impact our clients ability to pay their obligations as they become due

generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to sfas  ho wever  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values and  accordingly  sfas r does not allow pro forma disclosure as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r is effective for the beginning of the first annual period beginning after september  prior to january   we accounted for the incentive plan under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in the statement of operations for the years ended december  or  as all options granted under the incentive plan had an exercise

results for prior periods have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our net loss for the year ended december   is million higher than if it had continued to account for share based compensation under apb derivative instruments and hedging activities we engage in certain derivative related activities and have adopted sfas no

on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we primarily enter into investment related derivative transactions  as permitted by our investment guidelines  and typically for the purposes of managing investment duration  interest rate and foreign currency exposure  and enhancing total investment returns 
we may also  as part of our business  enter into derivative transactions for the purpose of replicating approved investment  insurance or reinsurance transactions that meet our investment or our underwriting guidelines 
as of december   we held in our available for sale fixed maturity portfolio a mortality risk linked security for which the repayment of principal was dependent on the performance of a specified mortality index 
the component of the bond that was linked to the mortality index had been determined  under sfas  to be an embedded derivative that was not clearly and closely related to its host contract a debt security and was therefore bifurcated and accounted for as a derivative under sfas this security was sold during the year ended december  we have not designated any of our derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
we recognize all standalone derivative instruments as either other assets or liabilities and embedded derivatives as part of their host instruments in our consolidated balance sheet and we measure all derivative instruments at their fair value 
the fair values of derivative instruments are based on market prices and equivalent data provided by independent third parties 
when market data is not readily available  we use analytical models to estimate the fair values of these instruments based on their structure  terms and conditions and prevailing market conditions 
we recognize changes in the fair value of derivative instruments in our consolidated statement of operations in other income 
the nature of derivative instruments and es timates used in estimating their fair value  changes in fair value of derivatives and realized gains and losses on settled derivative instruments may create significant volatility in our results of operations in future periods 
incentive plans during the year ended december   we adopted an annual variable cash compensation plan the annual variable cash incentive plan which was generally available to employees in and awards paid under this plan were dependent on performance measured at an individual and line of business level for the years ended december  and in general  the annual variable cash incentive plan provided for an annual bonus award to employees that was based on a sharing of profit in excess of a minimum return on capital to shareholders as calculated under the annual variable cash incentive plan 
profit for each calendar year was measured by estimating the ultimate net present value of after t ax profit generated from business during that calendar year and  up until december   was re estimated on an annual basis through the vesting period 
annual incentive plan awards for and have now fully vested and any remaining unpaid amounts are scheduled to be paid no later than march 
table of contents following our determination to engage in a self managed run off  employees will generally receive a bonus for the year ended december  based on individual performance that is comprised of a guaranteed and variable element 
awards are expected to be paid out in one installment to employees who remain employed on the date of the payment 
we recognize expenses related to annual variable cash incentive plan awards by applying the graded vesting method as prescribed by financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans fin 
we continually review and adjust our provisions for annual variable cash incentive plan awards and other bonus awards taking into account known information and updated assumptions related to unknown information 
award provisions are necessarily an estimate and amounts established in prior periods are adjusted in our current results of operations as new information becomes available to us 
any adjustments we make to previously established provisions or the establishment of new provisions may significantly impact our current period results and net income
