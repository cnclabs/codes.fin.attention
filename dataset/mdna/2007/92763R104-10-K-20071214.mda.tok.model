overview business environment virage logic provides semiconductor intellectual property ip to the global semiconductor industry 
our semiconductor ip offering consists of embedded memories  compilers that allow chip designers to configure our memories into different sizes and shapes on a single silicon chip  ip and development infrastructure for embedded test and repair of on chip memory instances  software development tools used to design memory compilers  embedded non volatile memory instances  logic cell libraries  i os  and ddr memory controller components 
these various forms of ip are utilized by our customers to design and manufacture system on chip soc integrated circuits that are forming the foundation of today s consumer  communications and networking  hand held and portable devices  computer and graphics  automotive  and defense applications 
we also provide custom design services to the semiconductor industry 
our customers include fabless semiconductor companies  integrated device manufacturers and foundries 
as semiconductor companies face increasing pressures to bring products to market faster and semiconductors have shorter product cycles  we focus on providing our customers a broad product offering as a means to satisfy a larger portion of our customers semiconductor ip needs  while positioning ourselves to offer advanced products as the semiconductor industry migrates to smaller geometries 
the timing of customer purchases of our products is typically related to new design starts by fabless companies and migration to new manufacturing processes by integrated device manufacturers and foundries 
because of the high costs involved in new design starts and migration to new manufacturing processes  our customers decision regarding these matters is heavily dependent on their long term business outlook 
as a result  our business  and specifically our license revenues  is likely to grow at times of positive outlook for the semiconductor industry 
in fiscal year  we derived of our license revenue from the more advanced processes  nanometer and nanometer technologies and from the older process nodes  predominantly   and micron technologies 
the company expects the nanometer  nanometer and nanometer technologies to drive revenue growth in the foreseeable future while license revenues from the older process nodes decline 
our royalty revenue to date has been from production on the older process nodes  and we expect future growth in royalty revenues to be driven by the advanced processes  nanometer  nanometer and nanometer technologies  in addition to continued production on the and micron technologies 
we sell our product early in the design process  and there are time delays of to months between the sale of our products and the time we expect to receive royalty revenues 
these time delays are due to the length of time required for our customers to implement our semiconductor ip into their designs  and then to manufacture  market and sell a product incorporating our products 
as a result  we expect our royalty revenues to increase in periods in which manufacturing volumes of semiconductors are growing 
future growth of our royalty revenue is dependent on our ability to increase the number of designs incorporating our products and on such designs achieving substantial manufacturing volumes 

table of contents sources of revenues our revenues are derived principally from licenses of our semiconductor ip products  which include semiconductor ip platforms  embedded memory  logic and i o elements  standard and custom memory compilers  memory test processor and fuse box components for embedded test and repair of defective memory cells  and double date rate memory controllers  physical interfaces  and delay locked loops 
we also derive revenues from royalties  custom design services  maintenance services and library development and consulting services related to the license of logic components 
our revenues are reported in two separate categories license revenues and royalty revenues 
license revenues are derived from license fees  maintenance fees  fees for custom design services  library design services and consulting services 
royalty revenues are derived from fees paid by a customer or a third party foundry based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies 
the license of our semiconductor ip typically covers a range of platform  embedded memory  logic  i o  ddr memory controller  phy and dll products 
licenses of our semiconductor ip products can be either perpetual or term based 
in addition  maintenance can be purchased for both types of licenses 
we derive our royalty revenues from pure play foundries that manufacture chips incorporating our area  speed and power asap memory  asp logic  siware memory  siware logic and star memory products for our fabless customers  and from integrated device manufacturers and fabless customers that utilize our star memory system tm and novea technologies 
royalty payments are in addition to the license fees we collect from our customers  and are calculated based on production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies based on a rate per chip or rate per wafer depending on the terms of the respective license agreement 
royalty revenues are generally determined and recognized one quarter in arrears  when a production volume report is received from the customer or foundry 
royalty revenues for the years ended september    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
we have been dependent on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our annual revenues  although that dependency continues to decrease 
customers comprising our top customer group have changed from time to time 
in each of fiscal year   and one customer  tsmc  generated or more of our revenues 
sales to customers located outside north america accounted for  and of our revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
substantially all of our direct sales representatives and field application engineers are located in north america and europe and serve those regions 
in japan and the rest of asia  we use both indirect sales through distributors and direct sales through sales representatives 
all revenues to date have been denominated in us dollars 
significant events in fiscal year we completed the acquisition of ingot systems  inc a leading provider of application specific ip solutions and design services to the semiconductor industry 
the acquisition expands our ability to serve the company s chosen markets by adding new products and services required in the rapid development of system on chip integrated circuits to our current family of physical ip products including memory compilers  logic libraries and related development tools 

table of contents we signed a total of agreements for our nanometer product offerings  agreements on nanometer  and agreements on nanometer 
for direct royalty bearing agreements  we have signed novea non volatile embedded memory product and star memory system products 
during the fiscal year  we signed agreements with a total of new customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments  which affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to percentage of completion  allowance for doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies such as litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies to our company revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  valuation of purchased intangibles  including goodwill  valuation of long lived assets  stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position and statement of position additionally  revenue is recognized on some of our products  according to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenues from perpetual licenses for the semiconductor ip products are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all criteria are met 
revenues from term based licenses are recognized ratably over the term of the license  which are generally between twelve to thirty six months in duration  provided the criteria mentioned above are met 
license of custom memory compilers and logic libraries may involve customization to the functionality of the software  therefore revenues from such licenses are recognized in accordance with statement of position over the period that services are performed 
revenue derived from library development services are recognized using a percentage of completion method  and revenues from technical consulting services are recognized as the services are performed 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  the company determines progress to completion based on labor hours incurred in comparison to the estimated total service hours required to complete the development or service or on the value of contract milestones completed 
the company believes that it is able to reasonably and reliably estimate the costs to complete projects accounted for using the percentage of completion method based on historical experience of similar project requirements 
if the company cannot reasonably and reliably estimate the costs to complete a project  the completed contract method of accounting is used  such that costs are deferred until the project is completed  at which time revenues and related costs are recognized 
a provision for estimated losses on any project is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
costs incurred 
table of contents in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as costs in excess of related revenue on uncompleted contracts 
if customer acceptance is required for completion of specified milestones  the related revenue is deferred until the acceptance criteria are met 
if a portion of the value of a contract is contingent based on meeting a specified criteria  then the contingent value of the contract is deferred until the contingency has been satisfied or removed 
for agreements that include multiple elements  the company recognizes revenues attributable to delivered or completed elements when such elements are completed or delivered 
the amount of such revenues is determined by applying the residual method of accounting by deducting the aggregate fair value of the undelivered or uncompleted elements  which the company determines by each such element s vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  from the total revenues recognizable under such agreement 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of each element of an arrangement is based upon the higher of the normal pricing for such licensed product and service when sold separately or the actual price stated in the contract  and for maintenance  it is determined based on of the net selling price of the license for new agreements starting in fiscal or the higher of the actual price stated in the contract or the stated renewal rate in each contract for all contracts entered prior to fiscal revenues are recognized once the company delivers the element identified as having vendor specific objective evidence or once the provision of the services is completed 
maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the remaining contractual term of the maintenance period from the date of delivery of the licensed materials receiving maintenance  which is generally twelve months 
the company assesses whether the fee associated with each transaction is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured and evaluates the payment terms 
if a portion of the fee is due beyond normal payment terms  the company recognizes the revenues on the payment due date  as long as collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the overall credit worthiness of the customer 
if collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of the payment 
amounts invoiced to customers in excess of recognized revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
amounts recognized as revenue in advance of invoicing the customer are recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues and unbilled accounts receivable in any given period 
all of the criteria under sop or sop  as applicable  have been met  prior to the recognition of any revenue that would create an unbilled accounts receivable balance 
royalty revenues are generally determined and recognized one quarter in arrears based on sop  when a production volume report is received from the customer or foundry  and are calculated based on actual production volumes of wafers containing chips utilizing our semiconductor ip technologies based on a rate per chip or rate per wafer depending on the terms of the respective license agreement 
prepaid royalties are recognized as revenue upon either the receipt of a corresponding royalty report or after all related license deliverables have been made 
valuation of accounts receivable we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon specific customer collection risks that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowance we have established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the quality of our accounts receivables and our future operating results 
valuation of purchased intangibles  including goodwill we periodically evaluate purchased intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment at least annually 
an assessment of goodwill is subjective by nature  and significant management judgment is required to forecast 
table of contents future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
if our estimates or related assumptions change in the future  these changes in conditions could require material write downs of net intangible assets  including impairment charges for goodwill 
the valuation of intangible assets was based on management s estimates 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the estimated life of each asset 
as of september   management believes no impairment of intangible assets has occurred 
the carrying value of purchased intangibles  including goodwill  is million and million as of september  and  respectively 
if the asset is deemed impaired  the maximum amount of impairment would be the full carrying value of the asset 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of assets indicate that their carrying amounts may not be fully recoverable or that their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
this review is based upon our projections of anticipated future cash flows from such assets 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations  which could result in an impairment charge 
as of september  the company had an intangible asset of million related to technology and other intangibles acquired through the acquisitions of in chip systems  inc and ingot systems  inc stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  shared based payments sfas r  which requires the measurement of all employee share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and other equity based awards  using a fair value based method and the recording of such expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the accounting provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  as of october   we adopted sfas r 
we now use the fair value method to apply the provisions of sfas r with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to unvested awards that were outstanding on the effective date 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
total sfas r compensation expense recognized for fiscal years ended september  and was million and million  respectively 
as of september   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense net of forfeitures related to non vested equity awards granted prior to that date was million and will be amortized over the average of years 
prior to october   we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method of accounting resulted in compensation expense for restricted stock and restricted stock units at fair value on date of grant based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and for stock options to the extent option exercise prices were set below market prices on the date of grant 
also  to the extent stock awards were subject to an exchange offer  other modifications  or performance criteria  such awards were subject to variable accounting treatment 
to the extent stock awards were forfeited prior to vesting  the corresponding previously recognized expense was reversed as an offset to operating expenses 
we value our stock based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each stock based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using a pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as 
table of contents assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee equity awards exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
for purposes of estimating the fair value of equity awards granted during the fiscal year ended september  and using the black scholes model  we have made an estimate regarding our stock price volatility using the historical volatility in our stock price for the expected volatility assumption input to the model 
this approach is consistent with the guidance in sfas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term of the awards on the grant date 
furthermore  as required under sfas r  we estimate forfeitures for equity awards granted which are not expected to vest 
we calculate the pre vesting forfeiture rate by using our historical equity grants cancellation information 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using pricing models to estimate stock based compensation under sfas r 
there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee stock based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using a pricing model  such value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
accounting for income taxes we calculate our income taxes based on an estimated annual effective tax rate in compliance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 income tax expense benefit is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and for deferred tax assets and liabilities for the tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
however  as required by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes in interim periods fin  the impact of items of tax expense or benefit that do not relate to ordinary income in the current year generally should be accounted for discretely in the period in which it occurs and be excluded from the effective tax rate calculation 
as a result the company reported a discrete tax benefit of approximately  relating primarily to research and development credit claimed due to the re enactment of the research and development credit and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options which had previously been expensed for generally accepted accounting principles purposes 
significant components affecting the tax rate include an increase from stock based compensation relating to non deductible incentive stock options and the composite state tax rate 
for financial statement purposes  we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits  deductions and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
if actual results differ from our estimates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 

table of contents we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these differences resulted in deferred tax assets of million and deferred tax liabilities of million as of september  we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not more likely than not  we increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that substantially all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not more likely than not 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments are probable 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
taxes payable were million and million as of september  and  respectively

our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of our existing and new technologies  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing of the introduction of new technologies  expansion of sales and marketing efforts  potential acquisitions  and levels of working capital  primarily accounts receivable 
there can be no assurance that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on satisfactory terms 
we believe that our current capital resources and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months  although we may seek to raise additional capital during that period and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing beyond this time frame

 fair value measurements  or sfas the standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas must be adopted prospectively as of the beginning of the year it is initially applied 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are still evaluating the impact of this standard on our financial position or results of operations

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following tables contain unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for our eight most recent quarters 
the first table contains revenue and expense data expressed in dollars  while the second table contains the same data expressed as a percentage of our revenues for the periods indicated 
this data has been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments necessary  consisting only normal recurring adjustments  for a fair statement of the information 
our quarterly results have been in the past  and in the future may be  subject to fluctuations 
as a result  we believe that results of operations for the interim periods may not be an accurate indicator of results for any future period

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our core business  the sale of semiconductor ip for the design and manufacture of system on a chip integrated circuits  has exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
a significant portion of our customers are located in asia  canada and europe 
however  to date  our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations has been minimal because all of our license agreements provide for payment in us dollars 
our international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax environments  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
to date these expenses have not been significant  therefore  we do not anticipate our future results to be materially adversely impacted by changes in factors affecting international operations 
we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and changes in the market values of our investments 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our investments primarily consist of short term money market mutual funds  united states government obligations  mortgage backed securities  corporate bonds  and commercial paper 
our short term investments balance of million at september  consists of instruments with original maturities of less than one year 
we also hold approximately million in us government obligation with maturities greater than one year 
the estimated fair value of our investment portfolio as of september   assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by approximately million  which would not materially affect our operations 
we have the ability to generally hold our fixed income investments until maturity and therefore we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
if necessary  we may sell short term investments prior to maturity to meet our liquidity needs
