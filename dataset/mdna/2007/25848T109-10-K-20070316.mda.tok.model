overview we are a provider of storage systems for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions consist of integrated hardware and software products employing a modular system that allows end users to add capacity as needed 
our broad range of products  from medium capacity stand alone storage units to complete turn key  multi terabyte storage area networks  provides end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our products and services are sold worldwide to end users primarily through our channel partners  including oems  sis and vars 
in may  we entered into a three year oem agreement with sun to provide our storage hardware and software products for private label sales by sun 
we have been shipping our products to sun for resale to sun s customers since october we continued to develop new products primarily for resale by sun  such as our sannet ii fc  which began shipping to sun in march and our sannet ii sata product which began shipping in june in september  our existing oem partner agreement with sun  first announced in may  was extended until january and now provides for automatic renewal for additional one year periods unless either party notifies the other of its intent not to renew within a specified period of time 
the agreement does not contain any minimum purchase requirements 
in february  we acquired all the outstanding shares of chaparral  a privately held storage system provider 
this acquisition provided us with a core of raid hardware and software technology and a team of hardware and software professionals located in longmont  colorado 
in july  we entered into a development and oem supply agreement with netapp 
under the agreement  we are designing and developing general purpose disk arrays for a variety of products to be developed for sale to netapp 
we expect to start shipping products under this agreement over the next several quarters 
the agreement does not contain any minimum purchase requirements and expires three years after shipping the first product  but renews annually unless it is terminated by either party 
in january  we entered into a master purchase agreement with fujitsu 
under the agreement  dot hill and fujitsu will jointly develop storage solutions utilizing key components and patented technologies from dot hill 
we began shipping products under this agreement in july the agreement does not contain any minimum purchase commitments by fujitsu 
the initial agreement term is five years 
as part of our focus on indirect sales channels  we have historically outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to solectron  a leading electronics manufacturing services company 
our agreement with 
table of contents solectron allows us to reduce sales cycle times and our manufacturing infrastructure  increase working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of solectron s manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
in february  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with mitac  a leading provider of contract manufacturing and original design manufacturing services  and synnex  a leading global it supply chain services company 
under the terms of the agreement  mitac will supply dot hill with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china  and synnex will provide dot hill with final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its facilities in fremont  california and telford  united kingdom 
we believe that the agreement with mitac and synnex will facilitate our strategic product initiatives  help to expand our global capabilities and reduce our manufacturing costs 
we expect to begin shipping products under the mitac and synnex agreement over the next several quarters 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our sannet ii family of products and we are in the process of transitioning sannet ii customers to our family of products 
we derive a portion of our revenue from services associated with the maintenance service we provide for our installed products 
in may  we entered into a services agreement with anacomp to provide all maintenance  warranty and non warranty services for our sannet i and certain legacy products 
we recently entered into an agreement with gavs to provide warranty and non warranty services for customers who purchase new maintenance agreements for our prior generation sannet product family as well as our new r evolution platform 
anacomp  our current service provider  will manage our sannet i support for our non warranty customers 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  as well as accounting and legal fees and expenditures for administrative facilities 
restructuring expenses consist primarily of employee severance  lease termination costs and other office closure expenses related to the consolidation of excess facilities 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in our interest expense primarily related to a million note payable that we assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral 
during august  we made a payment of approximately million representing both principal and interest to the holder of the promissory note assumed in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in february there are no further amounts due 
in august  we merged with artecon and we changed our name from box hill systems corp 
to dot hill systems corp 
we reincorporated in delaware in our headquarters is located in carlsbad  california  and we maintain international offices in germany  japan  the netherlands  china and the united kingdom 
on february   we completed the acquisition of chaparral  a privately held developer of specialized storage appliances as well as high performance  mid range raid controllers and data routers 
the total transaction cost of approximately million consisted of a payment of approximately million in cash  the assumption of approximately million related to obligations due certain employees covered by change in control agreements  approximately million of direct transaction costs and approximately million of accrued integration costs 
we believe the acquisition of chaparral has enabled us to increase the amount of proprietary technology within our storage systems  broaden our product line and diversify our customer base 
we introduced the during the third quarter of the is the first product developed and launched based on the technology acquired from chaparral and is also the first in a family of offerings focused on the incorporation of sas and sata drive technology in the same infrastructure with a variety of front end host interfaces 
we are now shipping the product to over a dozen customers  including fujitsu  and shipped over  units in the second half of 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our on going internal processes  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory write downs  warranty cost accruals  revenue recognition  bad debt allowances  long lived assets valuation  goodwill and intangible assets valuation  income taxes  including deferred income tax asset valuation  stock based compensation  litigation and contingencies 
we base these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that we believe are valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for product sales upon transfer of title to the customer 
reductions to revenue for estimated sales returns are also recorded at that time 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  changes in customer demand and other factors 
if actual future returns and allowances differ from past experience  additional allowances may be required 
certain of our sales arrangements include multiple elements 
generally  these arrangements include delivery of the product  installation  training and product maintenance 
maintenance related to product sales entitles the customer to basic product support and faster response time in resolving warranty related issues 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based on its relative fair value 
for maintenance contracts this is typically the price charged when such contracts are sold separately or renewed 
because professional services related to installation and training can be provided by other third party organizations  we allocate revenue related to professional services based on rates that are consistent with other like companies providing similar services  ie  the market rate for such services 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally months 
revenue from installation  training and consulting is recognized as the services are performed 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we perform periodic valuation assessments based on projected sales forecasts and analyzing upcoming changes in future configurations of our products and record inventory write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts  we periodically are faced with uncertainties 
the outcomes of these uncertainties are not within our control  and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and commitments  and consequently  on our operating results 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those forecasted  additional inventory write downs might be required  adversely affecting operating results 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step 
table of contents impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference 
the income approach is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and adjust the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by the valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will be realized  or not realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
due to our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of internal revenue code  or irc  section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of dot hill immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of irc section f in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
as a result of our acquisition of chaparral  a second ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on february  as a result  annual use of the acquired chaparral s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
at december   based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative profitability in recent years  we determined that it was more likely than not that all of our united states deferred tax assets would be realized and  at december   eliminated million of valuation allowance associated with our united states deferred tax assets 
the elimination of the valuation allowance resulted in a million decrease to goodwill to the extent of our acquired net deferred tax assets  and a million increase to equity for net operating losses arising from stock option deductions  with the remaining million recognized as a one time non cash increase in earnings for the year ended december  consistent with the december  analysis  at september  we weighted the cumulative earnings evidence and forecasted future earnings evidence as the most significant factors in our analysis of the recoverability of its united states deferred tax assets in due to changes in  we determined that there was an overall greater proportional weight of negative evidence rather than positive evidence 
based on the expected cumulative three year united states pre tax loss as of december  and the anticipated losses in  we concluded that we did not have objective  verifiable evidence of sufficient future taxable income to recover our united states deferred tax assets 
as a result  the company determined that as of september  it was not more likely than not that our united states deferred tax assets would be realized and re established a million valuation allowance associated with our united states deferred tax assets 

table of contents stock based compensation through december   we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic method  we did not record any expenses as the exercise price of stock options granted equaled the fair market value of our stock at the date of grant 
on december   we accelerated vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share that were previously awarded under our equity compensation plans to our employees 
these options were accelerated to avoid recording future compensation expense with respect to such options following adoption of sfas no 
r as discussed below 
our management believes that because such options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of our stock  the options were not achieving their original objective 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of december  options to purchase million shares of common stock were subject to the acceleration and the weighted average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration was 
due to this acceleration  an additional million is included in the pro forma stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  directors and consultants  including stock option grants and purchases of stock made pursuant to our amended and restated equity incentive plan  or the eip  our amended and restated non employee directors stock option plan  or the nedsop  and our amended and restated employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r supercedes our previous accounting under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
 share based payment  and we have applied sab no 
s provisions in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  as further described below 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our audited condensed consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  share based compensation expense was only recognized by dot hill if the exercise price of the grant was less than the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
no stock based compensation expense was recorded by dot hill for the years ended december  and  respectively 
contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims and tax matters  the outcome of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding contingencies

we shipped  of our units for the year ended december  compared to none for the year ended december  we shipped  fibre channel units for the year ended december  compared to  fibre channel units shipped for the year ended december  we shipped  scsi units during the year ended december  compared to  scsi units for the year ended december  we shipped  blade units during the year ended december  compared to  blade units shipped for the year ended december  we shipped  sata units during the year ended december  compared to  sata units shipped for the year ended december  our sales to sun accounted for or million of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to or million for the year ended december  non sun revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  cost of goods sold increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold was attributable to high initial production costs associated with our product  and the greater volume of product sales during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of our net revenue is primarily attributable to a difference in our product mix resulting from sales of our product  share based compensation expense of 
table of contents million related to the adoption of sfas no 
r and increased headcount see gross profit section below for further explanation 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the dollar amount of gross profit is attributable to high initial production costs associated with our product  which is currently being manufactured primarily in the united states in a soft tooled production environment 
these costs should decrease as we transition manufacturing to mitac and synnex 
in addition  we began paying royalties to crossroads and had increased expenses associated with additional headcount and consulting fees 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  is attributable to the increased proportion of the product in our overall product mix and overhead and new product introduction expenses associated with other products that were readied for production during the year 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in sales and marketing expenses is primarily attributable to a decrease in pay and pay related costs of million primarily at our subsidiaries in japan and europe and reduced advertising expenses of million offset by share based compensation expense of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we expect sales and marketing expenses for the year ending december  to remain consistent with spending levels incurred during research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses is primarily due to the investment in prototypes and project materials for products under development for our new oem customers of million  payroll related expenses of million  testing expense of million  facility related expenses of million  and shared based compensation expense of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december  will decrease from spending levels incurred during due to our investment in prototypes and project materials for products under development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to million of expenses associated with the acceleration of vesting of stock options of our former chief executive officer and his consulting agreement  legal expense of million  share based compensation expense of million related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and accounting  auditing and tax consulting expense of million 
this is offset by a decrease in bad debt expense 
we expect general and administrative expenses for the year ending december  will be generally consistent with spending levels incurred during 
table of contents legal settlement expense on june   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with crossroads that settles crossroads lawsuit against us and licenses to us the family of patents from which it stemmed 
we concurrently entered into an agreement between dot hill systems and infortrend re settlement of crossroads lawsuit with infortrend 
in accordance with the crossroads and infortrend agreements  on july   we paid million to crossroads for alleged past damages and crossroads agreed to dismiss all patent claims against us 
as part of the agreement between dot hill and infortrend  infortrend paid crossroads an additional million on july   from which million was withheld for taiwan taxes and is included in income tax expense on our statement of operations 
on october   we made a million payment to crossroads representing the remaining settlement amount due plus late fees 
please refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other income other income increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of million due to higher interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in other income expense  net of million 
income taxes we recognized an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the expense was comprised of a million discrete tax expense associated with the establishment of full valuation allowances for united states deferred tax assets 
our effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the united states federal statutory rate due to this million discrete tax expense associated with the establishment of valuation allowances related to united states deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance against operations taxed in foreign jurisdictions  foreign taxes and state taxes 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and adjust the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is judged to be more likely than not 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income or loss  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
as of december   we had previously reversed a valuation allowance on our united states deferred tax assets totaling million 
based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of million  and a net income tax benefit of million 
this reversal was the result of our recent sustained history of operating profitability as of december  and the determination by management at that time that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
consistent with the december  analysis  at september  we weighted the cumulative earnings evidence and forecasted future earnings evidence as the most significant factors in its analysis of the recoverability of its united states deferred tax assets in due to changes in  we determined that there was an overall greater proportional weight of negative evidence rather than positive evidence 
based on the expected cumulative three year united states pre tax loss as of december  and the anticipated losses in  we concluded that we did not have objective  verifiable evidence of sufficient future taxable income to recover our united states deferred tax assets 
as a result  we determined that as of september  it was not more likely than not that our united states deferred tax assets would be realized and re established a million valuation allowance associated with our united states deferred tax assets 
as of december   we have federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in the tax years ending and  respectively 
in addition  we have federal tax credit carryforwards of million  of which approximately million can be carried forward 
table of contents indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending we also have state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
as a result of our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of dot hill immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the irc in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
as a result of our acquisition of chaparral  a second ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on february  as a result  annual use of chaparral s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual united states income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual united states income taxes  if any  would be insignificant 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from our channel partner  sun  as a result of a change in product mix 
our sales to sun accounted for or million of our net revenue for the year ended december  compared to or million for the year ended december  total fibre channel units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  fibre channel units shipped for the year ended december   scsi units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  scsi units for the year ended december   blade units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  blade units shipped for the year ended december   sata units were shipped during the year ended december  compared to  sata units shipped for the year ended december  in march  we announced that our existing oem partner agreement with sun was expanded to include new advanced technology storage products to be designed and engineered by us to sun s specifications 
our sata product began shipping in the second quarter of while our blade product began shipping in the first quarter of we recorded revenue of approximately million and million related to sata and blade products during the years ended december  and  respectively 
non sun revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of goods sold cost of goods sold increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  cost of goods sold increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the dollar amount of cost of goods sold was primarily attributable increased staffing and depreciation expenses  coupled with costs associated with the disposal of ceratin production related fixed assets and our inability to obtain disk drive price reductions as there was an industry wide shortage of disk drives 
the increase in cost of goods sold  as a percentage of our net revenue was primarily attributable to an increase of salaries from an increase in staffing  an increase of depreciation expense resulting from increased equipment purchases related to ramp up activities at an asian location of our contract manufacturer  the disposal of certain 
table of contents production related fixed assets and the inability to obtain the usual disk drive price reductions due to the industry wide shortage of disk drives 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the dollar amount of gross profit is attributable to increased spending related to the items discussed above 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of our net revenue for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  can be attributed  in part  to continued pricing pressures on our mature products  to changes in customer and product mix  to lower than anticipated sales volume  to increase spending to the items discussed above  and the inability to obtain the usual disk drive price reductions due to the industry wide shortage of disk drives 
our gross profit margin was also negatively impacted for the year ended december  by sales of our sata product that had a significantly lower gross profit margin than either our fibre channel or scsi products 
gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by a full twelve months of amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the chaparral transaction for the year ended december  as compared to months of amortization for the year ended december  amortization of finite lived intangible assets acquired in the chaparral transaction was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the year ended december  reflects only ten months of amortization due to the timing of the chaparral acquisition in late february sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses was partially attributable to a full year of salaries and related expenses for those employees added in connection with our acquisition of chaparral in late february compared to ten months for the year ended december  we also incurred additional advertising and other related marketing expenses of million related to additional sales activities incurred by our european subsidiary as we continued to pursue an increased market share in europe and we continued our effort to grow our non oem commercial sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was partially attributable to an increase in salaries  facility related expenses and all other expenses associated with our acquisition of chaparral in late february additionally  costs associated with the research and development of new product offerings increased by million  which was partially offset by a reduction in costs of million related to our sata product which was released for sale early in the second quarter of we also incurred additional expenses of million related to test equipment and a loss on the disposal of fixed assets 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses were for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase was partially attributable to an increase in bad debt expense of million which related to our subsidiaries in europe  an increase of million related to the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase of million related to contract labor  and an 
table of contents increase of million in legal fees 
additionally  the year ended december  included a full year of compensation paid to our president  formerly our chief technology officer  that had been classified as research and development expense for the first nine months of the year ended december  we also incurred expenses of million related to severance and retirement expenses in our subsidiary in japan and million related to the implementation of a new erp software package which became operational 
restructuring expenses in june  we negotiated an exit from our lease of the th floor of our former new york city office  which eliminated our related rent exposure 
accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded a reduction of approximately million to our restructuring reserve previously established in connection with the closure of our new york city office 
additionally  we had evaluated certain factors pertaining to our remaining sublease tenant  accordingly  during the three months ended june   we recorded an additional restructuring accrual of approximately million 
we were not aware of any further unresolved issues or additional liabilities that may have resulted in a significant adjustment to restructuring expenses accrued as of december  in process research and development charges projects that qualify as in process research and development represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and for which no future alternative uses exist

for the year ended december  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million  in connection with the acquisition of chaparral 
there were no similar charges for the year ended december  other income other income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of million due to rising interest rates and a decrease in interest expense of approximately million as a result of the payoff in august of a million note payable that was assumed in connection with the acquisition of chaparral and the repayment and termination of our japanese credit facilities in the fourth quarter of income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the benefit was comprised of million attributed to a one time non cash elimination of valuation allowances associated with our united states deferred tax assets offset by a million expense related to earnings for the year ended december  the income tax expense for the year ended december  was attributed to federal and state minimum tax liabilities as well as local and foreign taxes

as of december   we reversed our valuation allowance on our united states deferred tax assets totaling million 
based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of million  and a net income tax benefit of million 
this reversal was a result of our recent sustained history of operating profitability as of december  and the determination by management that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was judged to be more likely than not  at that time 
we exercised significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 

table of contents as of december   a valuation allowance of million was provided for the foreign deferred tax assets based upon our assessment of the future realizability of certain foreign deferred tax assets  as it was more likely than not that sufficient taxable income would not be generated to realize these temporary differences 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  respectively  some of which began to expire in  and the remainder will begin to expire in in addition  we had federal tax credit carryforwards of million  of which approximately million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending we also had state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million which began to expire in the tax year ending as a result of our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of dot hill immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the irc in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
as a result of our acquisition of chaparral  a second ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on february  as a result  annual use of chaparral s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared to cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december  the net cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to the net loss of million offset by depreciation and amortization of million  loss on disposal of property and equipment of million  provision for doubtful accounts of million  share based compensation expense of million and non cash charge of million related to the reversal of valuation allowances previously established for united states deferred income tax assets 
cash flow from operations reflects the positive impact of million related to an increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued expenses  an increase in other liabilities of million and an increase of million in income taxes payable as well as a decrease of million in inventory 
cash provided from operations was negatively impacted by a growth in accounts receivable of approximately million  resulting from increased revenue in as well as a growth in days sales outstanding due to the timing of cash receipts 
in addition  cash flow from operations was negatively impacted by a growth in pre paid expenses and other assets of million and a decline in deferred revenue of million  as well as the elimination of a modest restructuring accrual 
cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  the cash provided during is primarily attributable to proceeds of million received from the sales of short term investments offset by purchases of million in short term investments 
we made capital expenditures of million during the year ended december  primarily associated with purchase of test equipment  our new erp software package and leasehold improvements to our new corporate headquarters 
we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended 
table of contents december   we received million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options under the eip  million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and million in proceeds from the sale of stock under the espp 
effective july   we amended our credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  or wells fargo  which allows us to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit that expires july  amounts loaned under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time  or at a fixed rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
in connection with the credit agreement  to the extent we have outstanding borrowings  we have granted wells fargo a security interest in our investment management account maintained with wells capital management incorporated 
as of december  and december   there were no balances outstanding under this line of credit 
the credit agreement limits any new borrowings  loans  or advances outside of the credit agreement to an amount less than million and annual capital expenditures to an amount less than million 
we presently expect cash and cash equivalents to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months and to enable us to pursue acquisitions or significant capital improvements 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of revenues from continued operations  our ability to manage our relationships with third party manufacturers  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maximize investment yields and maintain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements 
accordingly  we invest in instruments such as money market funds  certificates of deposit  united states government agencies bonds  notes  bills and municipal bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we currently do not hedge against interest rate exposure 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  a hypothetical  reasonably possible  near term change of basis points in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially impact the fair values of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income  while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense  as well as interest income 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we believe that we are not subject to any material market risk exposure 
the following table provides information about our investment portfolio at december  and for investment securities  the table presents related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates and carrying values in thousands at december cash equivalents average interest rate short term investments average interest rate total portfolio average interest rate we have a line of credit agreement  which accrues interest at a variable rate 
as of december   we had no balance under this line 
if we incur a balance under this line  we will be exposed to interest rate risk on such debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the united states dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we do not currently intend to engage in hedging activities in the future
