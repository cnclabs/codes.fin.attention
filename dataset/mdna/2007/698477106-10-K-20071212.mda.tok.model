item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations general the company s principal line of business is the production and sale of oil and natural gas 
results of operations are dependent upon the quantity of production and the price obtained for such production 
prices received by the company for the sale of its oil and natural gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
these fluctuations affect the company s ability to maintain or increase its production from existing oil and gas properties and to explore  develop or acquire new properties 
capital expenditures  which increased significantly in and  are expected to again increase in which should translate into increased production volumes for the company going forward

production oil bbls gas mcf mcfe average sales price oil per bbl gas per mcf mcfe compared to overview the company recorded net income of  in  compared to net income of  in total revenues were slightly higher in as a result of increased oil and gas sales generated by increased sales volumes of oil and natural gas in as compared to however  the revenue increases were more than offset by substantial increases in exploration costs  depreciation  depletion and amortization and provision for impairment expense in as compared to 
table of contents revenues total revenues increased  or for as compared to the increase was the result of a  increase in oil and natural gas sales  a  increase in combined realized and unrealized gains on natural gas collar contracts and a  decrease in lease bonuses and rentals 
oil and natural gas sales increases were due to an overall increase in oil and natural gas production  a decrease in oil prices and a decrease in natural gas prices 
the production increases are the result of the company s continued strategy of participating with higher interests in new wells  especially in the dill city and woodford shale areas where significant production is now being received from several newly completed wells 
all realized and unrealized gains from natural gas collar contracts in were a part of the revenue increase as no hedging of natural gas prices had been implemented previously by the company 
the decrease in lease bonuses and rentals is attributed to the company s strategy of increasing its average working interest in wells by participating with larger portions of its mineral acreage as well proposals are received  thus leasing to third parties less 
the table above outlines the company s production and average sales prices for oil and natural gas for and high drilling activity continues in some key areas where the company has significant mineral and leasehold acreage positions and as the company continues its strategy to increase its working interest participation in new wells  budgeted drilling commitments have been increased to million

lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe increased  or in the increase is a result of the increased number of larger ownership wells going on line in  new wells normally have higher operating costs the first several months of production and the continuing increase in the overall number of wells in which the company has an interest 
loe costs per mcfe of production were 
in both and production taxes production taxes increased  or in the increase is the result of the higher oil and gas revenues in  as production taxes are paid as a percentage of these revenues 
exploration costs exploration costs increased  in as compared to this increase is principally the result of a  exploratory dry hole drilled in as compared to a  exploratory dry hole drilled in since the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations  only exploratory dry holes result in their costs being charged to exploration costs

such costs were higher in as compared to by  depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a increased  or in to per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in reductions in the estimate of remaining reserves on several properties  large increases in drilling expenditures the last two years  due to the company s participation with higher ownership interests in new wells and high initial production on these newly drilled wells resulted in this increase 
on of the company s over  working interest wells  reserve evaluations were reduced by the company s consulting engineer resulting in approximately million of additional dd a charges in as compared to dd a on significant new wells that began producing in accounted for another million of the dd a increase 
the continued increase in drilling expenditures which has added significantly to the depreciable base of the company s properties combined with the higher initial production received from these same properties thus accelerating the depreciation taken accounts for the remainder of the increase 
provision for impairment the provision for impairment increased  in as compared to one large western oklahoma field which was impaired by approximately million in was again impaired in by approximately million as production  and thus ultimate reserves  from the wells in this field has continued to decline at a faster rate than anticipated 
the impairment of a chaves county  new mexico field for approximately  a winkler county  texas field for approximately  and a beckham county  oklahoma field for approximately  comprise most of the remaining impairment provision 
loss on sale of assets loss on sale of assets increased  in as compared to several low performing properties in southeast oklahoma were sold in at a loss of  in  one property was sold at a loss of  other insignificant sales accounted for the remainder in both and general and administrative costs g a g a costs increased  or in increases of approximately  of directors expense   of salary and benefit related costs   of consulting costs and  of legal costs account for the majority of the overall increase in g a costs 
of the directors expense increase  approximately  relates to an amendment to the directors deferred compensation plan the plan that was effective october  the plan was amended so that on retirement  termination or death of the director or on a change in control of the company  the shares accrued under the plan will be issued to the director 
no shares are issued to a director until the occurrence of one of these events 
this amendment removed the conversion to cash option previously available under the plan  thus eliminating the requirement after october  that the deferred compensation accounts be adjusted for changes in the market value of the company s common stock 
the adjustment of the deferred compensation liability to market value of the shares at the closing price on october  resulted in a credit to g a of approximately  after the october  adjustment  the deferred compensation liability was reclassified to stockholders equity 
interest expense interest expense decreased in due to lower outstanding debt balances 

table of contents provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased  in as compared to as a result of income before provision for income tax decreasing by  the company utilizes excess percentage depletion to reduce its effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was for and for liquidity and capital resources at september   the company had positive working capital of  as compared to  at september  items with positive effects on working capital include increase in cash of  increase in oil and gas sales receivable of  and decrease in long term debt due within one year of  items that had a negative effect include a decrease in income tax and other receivable of  and an increase in accounts payable of  cash and oil and gas sales receivable have increased as a result of an overall increase in revenue 
the short term portion of the long term debt was eliminated as a term loan was paid off on september  the decrease in income tax and other receivable mainly relates to the company s receipt of a million income tax refund in and alternative minimum tax due for of  accounts payable increased due to the increased participation in drilling new wells 
capital expenditures increased and will continue to increase as the company implements its strategy of increasing the average working interest in new wells drilled  the drilling of oil and natural gas wells continues to increase in number and costs of drilling and equipping new wells continues to increase 
cash flow from operating activities increased over last year 
additions to properties and equipment for oil and gas activities for amounted to  as compared to  for management currently expects capital commitments for oil and gas activities to be approximately million for this includes expected well drilling and equipment costs of million and for both leasehold acreage purchases and workover expenses on existing wells 
the million commitment budget is expected to include expenditures of approximately million on gas resource drilling projects principally in southeast oklahoma and arkansas and million on drilling projects in western oklahoma 
any acquisition of oil and gas properties would further increase capital expenditures 
as the company does not operate any of the wells in which it participates  it is difficult to predict which or how many wells will actually be drilled in fiscal the company has historically funded capital expenditures  overhead costs and dividend payments from operating cash flow and has utilized  at times  its bank revolving line of credit facility to help fund these expenditures 
the million facility currently has a million borrowing base which could probably be expanded up to the million maximum  if needed 
the borrowing base is set by the company to minimize the fee on the unused portion of the borrowing base 
based on expected natural gas production volumes and prices for fiscal  the expected capital expenditure level discussed above  and no meaningful acquisitions of oil and gas properties  borrowings of million in fiscal are possible 
changes in production volumes or pricing or an acceleration or slowing down of the development in the gas resource projects would materially affect anticipated borrowings 
contractual obligations in october  the company arranged a new credit facility with bank of oklahoma bok replacing its credit facility with bancfirst of oklahoma city  oklahoma 
the bok agreement consisted of a term loan in the amount of  and a revolving loan in the amount of  which is subject to a semi annual borrowing base determination 
the current borrowing base under the bok agreement is  the term loan matured on september  and was paid off  and the revolving loan matures on october  monthly payments  began december  on the term 
table of contents loan and were  plus accrued interest 
borrowings under the revolving loan are due at maturity 
the term loans interest rate was day libor plus 
the revolving loan bears interest at the national prime rate minus from to  or day libor plus from to 
the interest rate charged will be based on the percent of the value advanced of the calculated loan value of panhandle s oil and gas reserves 
the interest rate spread from libor or the prime rate increases as a larger percent of the loan value of panhandle s oil and gas properties is advanced 
determinations of the borrowing base are made semi annually or whenever bok believes there has been a material change in the value of panhandle s oil and gas properties 
the loan agreement contains customary covenants which  among other things  require periodic financial and reserve reporting and limit the company s incurrence of indebtedness  liens  dividends and acquisitions of treasury stock  and require the company to maintain certain financial ratios 
at september   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
the table below summarizes the company s contractual obligations under the bok facility  as of september  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations hedging effective january   the company entered into the following three natural gas collar contracts

compared to overview the company recorded net income of  in  compared to net income of  in total revenues were higher in as a result of increased oil and gas sales generated by increases in the average sales prices of oil and natural gas and increased sales volumes of natural gas in as compared to the revenue increases were offset by substantial increases in depreciation  depletion and amortization and provision for impairment expense in as compared to revenues total revenues increased  or for as compared to the increase was the result of a  increase in oil and natural gas sales revenues offset by a decline in lease bonus revenues of  the increase in oil and gas sales revenues resulted from a and increase in the average sales price for oil and natural gas  respectively  and a increase in gas sales volumes 
the decrease in lease bonus revenue in is a result of the company leasing all of its non producing mineral acreage in arkansas in the total lease bonus  net of associated basis  was  as compared to normal leasing activity in the table above outlines the company s production and average sales prices for oil and natural gas for and the continuing increase in drilling expenditures and the company s stated goal of increasing its working interest percentage in new wells drilled is expected to result in continuing increased production volumes for gas in  as compared to the company has announced a significant increase  to million  in its drilling budget for drilling continues to be concentrated on natural gas prospects and new wells expected to be put on line in should continue to more than replace the decline of existing well production 

table of contents production by quarter for was as follows first quarter  mcfe second quarter  mcfe third quarter  mcfe fourth quarter  mcfe lease operating expenses and production taxes loe loe increased  or in the increase is a result of new larger percentage ownership wells going on line in  as new wells normally have higher operating costs the first several months of production  the continuing increase in the number of wells in which the company has an interest and general oilfield price increases 
in addition water disposal costs on one new well have been disproportionately high 
loe costs per mcfe of production were 
in as compared to 
in production taxes production taxes increased  or in the increase is the result of the higher oil and gas revenues in  as production taxes are paid as a percentage of these revenues 
exploration costs exploration costs decreased  in as compared to this decrease is principally the result of three higher cost exploratory dry holes drilled in as compared to only one in since the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas operations  only exploratory dry holes result in their costs being charged to exploration costs 
also  the company s charge to exploration costs for leasehold deemed worthless or the lease term had expired was higher in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a increased  or in the increase is a result of higher costs in on new wells as general oilfield price increases have been substantial the last two years 
these higher costs then must be depreciated 
in addition  projected remaining production volumes were reduced on some wells  which then increases current dd a costs 
further  high initial production rates and the inordinate amount of certain wells total estimated reserves being produced rapidly causes dd a to be heavily weighted to the front end of these wells lives 
provision for impairment the provision for impairment increased  in as compared to the impairment provision in benefited from higher natural gas prices as of september  used in the fair value calculations as compared to substantially lower prices used in the calculation 
natural gas prices declined dramatically during the fourth fiscal quarter of  and were at a low point for fiscal at september market price for natural gas affects the economic evaluation of properties and the potential impairment calculation 
the provision was principally the result of one well field in which the more recent wells drilled were not as good as earlier well results 
the last well drilled in the field  which was a large interest well  resulted in a poor well and caused the entire field to be in an impaired status 
this field s carrying value was impaired by approximately million 
an adjacent one well field also incurred a 
million impairment in 
table of contents loss on sale of assets loss on sale of assets decreased  in as compared to several low performing properties were sold in at a loss  with one group of wells sold at a loss of approximately  in  one property was sold at a loss of  and other insignificant sales accounted for the remaining  general and administrative costs g a g a costs decreased  or in the decrease is the result of an amendment to the directors deferred compensation plan the plan 
effective october   the plan was amended so that on retirement  termination or death of the director  or on a change in control of the company  the shares accrued under the plan will be issued to the director 
no shares are issued to a director until the occurrence of one of these events 
this amendment removed the conversion to cash option available under the plan  which eliminated the requirement to adjust the deferred compensation liability for changes in the market value of the company s common stock after october  the adjustment of the liability to market value of the shares at the closing price on october  resulted in a credit to g a of approximately  as compared to a charge of approximately  in in addition  the deferred compensation liability after the october  adjustment was reclassified to stockholders equity 
interest expense interest expense decreased in due to lower outstanding debt balances 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was basically flat as compared to  as income before provision for income tax increased only  the company utilizes excess percentage depletion to reduce its effective tax rate from the federal statutory rate 
the effective tax rate was for and for critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by the company generally do not change the company s reported cash flows or liquidity 
generally  accounting rules do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve a selection of the appropriate policies for applying the basic principles 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to the company 
the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are crude oil and natural gas reserve estimation  impairment of assets  oil and gas sales revenue accruals and tax accruals 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  geologists and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ from the estimates as additional information becomes known 
the oil and gas sales revenue accrual is particularly subject to estimates due to the company s status as a non operator on all of its properties 
production information obtained from well operators is substantially delayed 
this causes the estimation of recent production  used in the oil and gas revenue accrual  to be subject to some variations 

table of contents oil and gas reserves of these judgments and estimates  management considers the estimation of crude oil and nature gas reserves to be the most significant 
these estimates affect the unaudited standardized measure disclosures  as well as dd a and impairment calculations 
changes in crude oil and natural gas reserve estimates affect the company s calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization  provision for abandonment and assessment of the need for asset impairments 
on an annual basis  with a limited scope semi annual update  the company s consulting engineer the company employed a new consulting engineer beginning with the march  semi annual update  with assistance from company geologists  prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
as required by the guidelines and definitions established by the sec  these estimates are based on current crude oil and natural gas pricing 
crude oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide production and consumption and are outside the control of management 
projected future crude oil and natural gas pricing assumptions are used by management to prepare estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves used in formulating management s overall operating decisions in the exploration and production segment 
hedging the company periodically utilizes commodity price instruments  costless collars  to reduce its exposure to unfavorable changes in natural gas prices 
volumes under such contracts are a portion of expected production 
the company s collars contain a fixed floor price and a fixed ceiling price 
if market prices exceed the ceiling price or fall below the floor  then the company will receive the difference between the floor and market price or pay the difference between the ceiling and market price 
if market prices are between the ceiling and the floor  then no payments or receipts related to the collars are required 
the company accounts for its derivative contracts under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  sfas no 

under the provision of sfas no 
 the company is required to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and meeting the effectiveness guidelines of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is required to be measured at least quarterly based on relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and hedged item during the period of hedge designation 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is recognized currently in earnings 
for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments  the change in fair value is recognized in earnings during the period of change as a change in derivative fair value 
amounts recorded in unrealized gains losses on derivative activities do not represent cash gains or losses 
rather  these amounts are temporary valuation swings in contracts that are not entitled to receive hedge accounting treatment 
successful efforts method of accounting the company has elected to utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized by property using the unit of production method as oil and gas is produced 
this accounting method may 
table of contents yield significantly different operating results than the full cost method 
impairment of assets all long lived assets  principally oil and gas properties  are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may be greater than its future net cash flows 
the evaluations involve significant judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as inflation rates  future sales prices for oil and gas  future production costs  estimates of future oil and gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test a property for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or unfavorable adjustments to oil and gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when the company approves the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  the company cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
oil and gas sales revenue accrual the company does not operate any of its oil and gas properties  and it primarily holds small interests in approximately  wells 
thus  obtaining timely production data from the well operators is extremely difficult 
this requires the company to utilize past production receipts and estimated sales price information to estimate its oil and gas sales revenue accrual at the end of each quarterly period 
the oil and gas accrual can be impacted by many variables  including initial high production rates of new wells and subsequent rapid decline rates of those wells and rapidly changing market prices for natural gas 
this could lead to an over or under accrual of oil and gas sales at the end of any particular quarter 
based on past history  the estimated accrual has been materially accurate 
income taxes the estimation of the amounts of income tax to be recorded by the company involves interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations as well as the completion of complex calculations  including the determination of the company s percentage depletion deduction 
although the company s management believes its tax accruals are adequate  differences may occur in the future depending on the resolution of pending and new tax laws  regulations and interpretations 
the above description of the company s critical accounting policies is not intended to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties considered and estimates made by management in applying accounting principles and policies 
results may vary significantly if different policies were used or required and if new or different information becomes known to management 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s results of operations and operating cash flows can be significantly impacted by changes in market prices for oil and gas 
based on the company s production  a 
per mcf change in the price received for natural gas production would result in a corresponding  annual change in pre tax operating cash flow 
a per barrel change in the price received for oil production would result in a corresponding  annual change in pre tax operating cash flow 
cash flows could also be impacted  to a lesser extent  by changes in the market interest rates related to the company s credit facilities 
the revolving loan bears interest at the national prime rate minus from to  or day libor plus from to 
at september   the company had  outstanding under these facilities 
a change of 
in the prime rate or on libor would result in a change to interest expense of  
table of contents the company periodically utilizes certain commodity price instruments  costless collars  to reduce its exposure to unfavorable changes in natural gas prices 
volumes under such contracts are a portion of expected production 
the company s collars contain a fixed floor price and a fixed ceiling price 
if market prices exceed the ceiling price or fall below the floor  then the company will receive the difference between the floor and market price or pay the difference between the ceiling and market price 
if market prices are between the ceiling and the floor  then no payments or receipts related to the collars are required 
the company had not  through fiscal  entered into derivative instruments to hedge the price risk on its oil and gas production 
beginning in fiscal year  the company has entered in costless collar arrangements intended to reduce the company s exposure to short term fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
these arrangements cover only a portion of the company s production and provide only partial price protection against declines in natural gas prices 
these economic hedging arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit of future increases in prices 
the derivative instruments will settle based on the prices below which are basis adjusted and tied to certain pipelines in oklahoma 
effective january   the company entered into the following three natural gas collar contracts 
first contract production volume covered  mmbtu month january through december of floor of and a ceiling of second contract production volume covered  mmbtu month january through december of floor of and a ceiling of third contract production volume covered  mmbtu month january through december of floor of and a ceiling of subsequent to year end  in november  the company entered into the following natural gas collar contracts

table of contents while the company believes that its derivative contracts are effective in achieving the risk management objective for which they were intended  the company has elected not to complete all of the documentation requirements necessary under sfas no 
to permit these derivative contracts to be accounted for as cash flow hedges
