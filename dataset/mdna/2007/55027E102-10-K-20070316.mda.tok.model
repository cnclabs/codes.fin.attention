table of contents part i item business overview luminex corporation develops  manufactures and sells proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences industry 
the life sciences industry depends on a broad range of tests  called bioassays  to perform diagnostic tests  discover and develop new drugs and identify genes 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  protein analysis and biomedical research 
our products are described below under products 
luminex has established a position in the life sciences industry by developing and delivering products that meet customer and partner needs in specific market segments 
these needs are addressed by our proprietary technology  xmap technology  which allows the end user in a laboratory to perform biological testing in a multiplexed format 
multiplexing allows for many different laboratory results to be generated from one sample at one time 
this is important because our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
until the availability of multiplexing technology such as xmap  the laboratory professional had to perform one test on one sample in a sequential manner  and if additional testing was required on that sample  a second procedure would be performed to generate the second result  and so on until all the necessary tests were performed 
by using xmap technology  these end users have the opportunity to become more efficient by generating multiple simultaneous results per sample 
using the products luminex has available today  up to simultaneous analyte results can be generated from a single sample 
with products we are currently developing  the capacity of potential simultaneous analytes may increase significantly  and provide the company with the ability to address unmet customer and partner needs in existing and new market segments 
luminex has adopted a business model built around strategic partnerships 
information about our strategy is described under business strategy 
the company has licensed our xmap technology to other companies  who then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that they sell to the end user 
luminex develops and manufactures the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sells these products to our partners 
our partners sell xmap instrumentation  xmap based reagent consumable products or xmap based testing services  which run on the xmap instrumentation  to the end user customer  typically a testing laboratory 
when our partners sell an xmap based consumable product or xmap based testing service to their customer  luminex obtains a royalty on the sales from the partner 
the company was founded on this model  and our success to date has been due to this model 
as of the december   luminex had over strategic partners  of which have released commercialized reagent based products utilizing our technology  and these partners had sold and placed over  xmap based instruments in laboratories worldwide 
a fundamental component of the company s strategy over the past two years has been to augment the partnership model with a distribution model  designed to take advantage of our increasing installed base of xmap based instrumentation 
the company established the luminex bioscience group  which we refer to as lbg  in  with the charter of developing products that would be complementary to our partners products  that we would take responsibility for manufacturing on their behalf  and that our partners would then sell to the end user  thereby leveraging both our existing distribution channels and our existing installed base of instrumentation 
the lbg introduced their first two products in late  on schedule  and these new products will continue to be commercialized throughout 
table of contents in december of  we announced our intent to acquire tm bioscience of toronto  canada 
the transaction was completed on march  this was a stock for stock acquisition  and is  what we believe  a logical extension of our strategy 
tm bioscience  now a wholly owned subsidiary of the company and known as luminex molecular diagnostics  is a molecular diagnostics company 
tm bioscience had focused its resources on building a commercialization engine for the design  development  manufacture  marketing and selling of genetic tests  also referred to as dna based tests  nucleic acid tests or molecular diagnostics 
since  tm bioscience has focused on leveraging this engine in order to become a market leader in at least one of the three segments of the genetic testing market for which it is developing products  human genetics  personalized medicine and infectious disease 
tm bioscience is an innovator in the molecular diagnostics market 
we believe the molecular diagnostics market will be one of the fastest growing life sciences market segments over the next years  and one where multiplexing capability will be key to success 
tm bioscience had established a solid position in the marketplace with their product development and fda compliant manufacturing capabilities 
as the integration of tm bioscience  or luminex molecular diagnostics  and luminex occurs during  we believe the combined company will be in a position to take advantage of the complementary strengths of both companies in molecular diagnostics 
luminex was incorporated under the laws of the state of texas in may and began commercial production of our luminex system in we were reincorporated in the state of delaware in july our shares of common stock are traded on the nasdaq global market under the symbol lmnx

questions regarding the public reference room may be directed to the sec at industry background the life sciences industry uses bioassays to detect the presence and characteristics of certain biochemicals  proteins or nucleic acids in a sample 
drug discovery  genetic analysis  pharmacogenomics  clinical diagnostics and general biomedical research all use bioassays 
for example  bioassays can be used to measure the attraction  or affinity  between a chemical compound and a disease target for drug discovery and development  assist physicians in prescribing the appropriate tailored drug therapy based on the patient s unique genetic makeup  a process known as pharmacogenetics  detect genetic variations  such as single nucleotide polymorphisms  and measure the presence and quantity of biochemicals in a patient s blood  other body fluid or tissue to assist physicians in diagnosing  treating or monitoring disease conditions 
the life sciences customer can purchase bioassays in the form of complete off the shelf kits  develop them internally or utilize a customized service to meet their specific needs 
although it is important to note that our xmap technology is relevant to only a subset of the total life sciences market  industry reports estimated the total global market for tools and consumables used in drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research to have been approximately billion in and is expected to grow at an annual rate of approximately 
in the spring of  we completed a strategic study using the services of a consulting firm with extensive experience in the life sciences industry 
in december  we commissioned the same consulting firm to update and validate the data generated in the original study 
the results of both studies provided valuable information regarding market opportunities and market size for key industry segments in which we believe the company has 
table of contents distinct competitive advantages  including speed  precision  flexibility and cost  over existing technologies and approaches 
based on estimates contained in these studies  the key segments on which we are currently focused represent a potential market of approximately billion in end user sales with an anticipated annual growth rate of approximately

nucleic acid testing in clinical diagnostics and biomedical research 
microfluidics chips miniaturized liquid handling system on a chip biomedical research microtiter plate based assays plastic trays with discrete wells in which assays are fixed drug discovery  clinical diagnostics and biomedical research our xmap technology our xmap technology combines existing biological testing techniques with advanced digital signal processing and proprietary software 
with our technology  discrete bioassays are performed on the surface of color coded microspheres 
these microspheres are read in a compact analyzer that utilizes lasers and high speed digital signal processing to simultaneously identify the bioassay and measure the individual assay results 
the key features of xmap technology include the following multi analyte multi format xmap technology has been designed to simultaneously perform up to distinct bioassays in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample 
moreover  unlike most existing technologies that are dedicated to only one type of bioassay  xmap can perform multiple types of assays including enzymatic  genetic and immunologic tests on the same instrumentation platform 
flexibility scalability xmap technology allows flexibility in customizing test panels 
panels can be modified to include new bioassays in the same tube by adding additional microsphere sets 
it is also scalable  meaning that there is no change in the manufacturing process and only minimal changes to the required labor to produce a small or large number of microsphere based tests 
throughput our technology is currently able to perform up to tests in a single tube permitting up to  unattended tests to be detected in less than an hour with only a small amount of sample 
rapid sample analysis permits efficient use for high throughput applications 

table of contents ease of use most xmap bioassays are simple to perform 
a test sample is added to a solution containing microspheres that have been coated with reagents 
the solution is then processed through our xmap technology system which incorporates proprietary software to automate data acquisition and analysis in real time 
cost effective we have designed our xmap technology to be cost effective for customers compared to competitive techniques such as microarrays or enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa 
in addition  microsphere based bioassays are inexpensive compared to other technologies such as biochips 
polystyrene microspheres  approximately microns in diameter  are a fundamental component of the xmap technology 
we purchase and manufacture microspheres and  in a proprietary process  dye them with varying intensities of a red and a near infrared dye to achieve up to distinct colors 
the specific dye proportions permit each color coded microsphere to be readily identified based on its distinctive fluorescent signature 
our customers create bioassays by attaching different biochemical reactants to each distinctly colored microsphere set 
the microsphere sets can then be combined in test panels as required by the user  with a current maximum of tests per panel 
to perform a bioassay using xmap technology  a researcher attaches biochemicals  or reagents  to one or more sets of color coded microspheres  which are then mixed with a test sample 
this mixture is injected into the xmap analyzer  where the microspheres pass single file in a fluid stream through two laser beams 
the first laser excites the internal dyes that are used to identify the color of the microsphere and the test being performed on the surface of the microsphere 
the second laser excites a fluorescent dye captured on the surface of the microspheres that is used to quantify the result of the bioassay taking place 
our proprietary optics  digital signal processors and software record the fluorescent signature of each microsphere and compare the results to the known identity of that color coded microsphere set 
the results are analyzed and displayed in real time with data stored on the computer database for reference  evaluation and analysis 
business strategy our primary goal continues to be the establishment of our xmap technology as the industry standard for performing bioassays by transforming luminex from a technology based company to a more market driven  customer focused company 
to achieve this goal  we have implemented and are pursuing the following strategies focus on key market segments the key market segments identified as a result of our strategic studies in and were i profile oriented screening and secondary screening  ii rna profiling and transcriptional screening  iii genetic disease and molecular infectious disease testing  and iv immunodiagnostics 
in addition to the segments listed above  we have identified two potential market opportunities in the fields of bio defense  or bio threat testing  and agricultural biology testing 
we have dedicated our primary efforts towards these markets and will continue to employ a partnership driven business model focused on these key segments and selectively pursue potentially profitable opportunities in other segments 
we will continue to focus our commercialization efforts through strategic partners on large sectors of the life sciences industry where luminex believes it has distinct competitive advantages over existing and emerging technologies and approaches 
we define strategic partners as companies in the life sciences industry that either develop and distribute assays and tests on xmap technology or may only distribute our xmap technology based systems and consumables 
with our partners support  we have targeted major pharmaceutical companies  large clinical laboratories  research institutions and major medical institutions for our principal marketing efforts 
we believe these customers provide the greatest opportunity for maximizing the use of xmap based products and continued adoption by these industry leaders will promote wider market acceptance of our xmap technology 
continue to develop strategic partnerships focused on our key market segments

develop next generation products our research and development group is pursuing projects such as the development of consumables  automation  software and the expansion and enhancement of our multiplexing capabilities to advance our xmap technology and its market acceptance 
we are also collaborating with industry participants  biomedical research institutions and government entities to develop additional xmap products 
focus on content strategy and customer needs we are focused on maximizing the value we provide our partners and end user customers by co developing content applications with our partners based on our mutual customers needs and providing assay products directly to end users in those niche segments where our partners are either unable or unwilling to provide us access 
we believe that by enhancing our partner driven model with the delivery of value added assay content  luminex should be able to gain greater control over product development  market penetration and commercialization 
the lbg has developed a customer needs analysis  focused on the unmet testing needs of the end user 
based on this analysis  the lbg has developed an assay development program guided by the potential value generated by each target assay 
this approach resulted in the commercial launch of the first two applications from the lbg in opportunistically pursue acquisitions that could accelerate these strategies we have developed analysis tools and an evaluation template to assess potential acquisition targets to accelerate our business strategies

in addition  our patent portfolio includes other pending patent applications in the united states and their corresponding international and foreign counterparts in major industrial markets 
our patents and pending claims provide  or will provide  protection for systems and technologies that allow real time multiplexed analytical techniques for the detection and quantification of many analytes from a single sample 
we also hold a patent covering the precision dyeing process that we use to dye our microspheres 
we have been granted a patent on our zero dead time sampling architecture  which uses digital over sampling to measure the area of a fluorescence pulse instead of peak detection  giving increased sensitivity with no lost events 
other issued patents and pending patent applications cover specific aspects and applications of our xmap technology and on going molecular research 
however  as a result of a procedural omission  we are unable to pursue a patent application in japan corresponding to our us patent for real time multiplexing techniques 
the source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and or as a copyrighted work 
aspects of this software also are covered by an issued patent 

table of contents we also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with strategic partners  third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees and third party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original works of expression and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
effective with our acquisition of tm bioscience  the company now has an additional issued patents and pending patent applications 
government regulation food and drug administration the food and drug administration regulates medical devices pursuant to various statutes  namely the federal food  drug and cosmetic act as amended and supplemented by the medical device amendments of  the safe medical devices act of  the medical device amendments of  the fda export reform and enhancement act of  the fda modernization act of  the public health  security and bioterrorism preparedness and response act of  the medical device user fee and modernization act of  and the project bioshield act of medical devices  as defined by statute  include instruments  machines  in vitro reagents or other similar or related articles  including any components  parts  or accessories of such articles that are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other condition or in the cure  mitigation  treatment or prevention of disease  or are intended to affect the structure or function of the body and do not achieve their intended purpose through chemical action or metabolization 
the fda classifies medical devices intended for human use into three classes 
for class i devices  general controls for example  labeling and good manufacturing practices provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness 
class ii devices are products for which general controls do not provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness and for which there is sufficient information to establish special controls for example  guidelines and patient registries 
class iii devices are products for which neither general nor special controls provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness 
generally  class iii includes devices that support or sustain human life  are for uses that are substantially important in preventing impairment of human health  are used as a stand alone assay for patient screening or diagnosis of disease  or present a potential  unreasonable risk of illness or injury 
we manufacture a version of the luminex and luminex the luminex integrated system is and the luminex integrated system is  respectively for use with diagnostic assay kits that are available through our strategic partners 
for fda purposes  the luminex is and luminex is are considered a component of our partners kit products 
depending on the particular kit s regulatory classification into class i  ii  or iii and its intended use  kits manufactured by our strategic partners that are used in conjunction with our technology may be subject to fda clearance or approval before they can be marketed and sold 
after incorporating the luminex is or luminex is into their products  our strategic partners are required to make various premarket submissions such as premarket approval applications  premarket notifications and or investigational device exemption applications to the fda for their products and are required to comply with numerous requirements and restrictions prior to clearance or approval of the applications 
there can be no assurance that the fda will file  clear or approve our strategic partners submissions 
we manufacture kit products that are intended for research use only applications as well as kits that are of the regulatory classification of class ii exempt 
in  we submitted a device master file dmf with information about the luminex is to the fda 
the dmf was updated in to include the luminex is 
our strategic partners can reference the dmf in their premarket submissions 
in  the fda reviewed our dmf while reviewing one of our strategic partner s submissions  and asked questions of the company about the content of the dmf 
it is possible that the fda may ask questions about our dmf each time one of our strategic partners submits an application to the fda referencing our dmf 
although we intend to respond to the fda s questions in a timely fashion  there can be no assurance that our responses will be acceptable to the fda 
updates to the dmf are provided to the fda as required 

table of contents our instruments use lasers to identify the bioassays and measure their results 
therefore  we are required to ensure that our products comply with fda regulations pertaining to the performance of laser products 
these regulations are intended to ensure the safety of laser products by establishing standards to prevent exposure to excess levels of laser radiation 
there can be no assurance that the fda will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations 
we  and our strategic partners  may be subject to periodic inspection by the fda for  among other things  compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice regulations 
these regulations  also known as the quality system regulations  govern the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for  the design  manufacture  packaging and servicing of all finished medical devices intended for human use 
additionally  our strategic partners may be subject to other premarket and postmarket controls such as labeling  complaint handling  medical device reporting  corrections and removals reporting  and record keeping requirements 
if the fda has evidence demonstrating that a company is not in compliance with applicable regulations  it can detain or seize products  request or  in certain circumstances  require a recall  impose operating restrictions  enjoin future violations  recommend criminal prosecution to the department of justice  and assess civil and criminal penalties against the company  its officers  or its employees 
other regulatory agencies may have similar powers 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the united states 
these range from comprehensive preapproval requirements for medical products to simpler requests for product data or certification 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
there can be no assurance that we  and our strategic partners  will be able to obtain any approvals that may be required to market xmap technology products outside the united states 
failure by us  or our strategic partners  to comply with applicable federal  state and foreign medical product laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices and components of such devices are subject to future changes 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such changes might have on our business  but any such change could have a material impact 
weee as part of the council directive of february   waste electrical and electronic equipment weee  we are in compliance with the requirements  beginning on august   regarding the labeling and disposal of some of our products containing electronic devices in each of the european union eu member states where our regulated products are distributed 
while we are taking steps to comply with the requirements of weee  we cannot be certain that we will comply with the implementation of weee in all eu member states 
european ivd directive the eu s regulation of in vitro medical devices is under the in vitro diagnostic directive ivdd ec of october  as implemented in the eu member states 
the principle behind the directive is that no in vitro device or accessory may be placed on the market or put into service unless it satisfies the essential requirements set forth in the directive 
devices considered to meet the essential requirements must bear the ce marking of conformity when they are placed on the market 
the responsibility for placing the ce marking on the device lies with the manufacturer 
a manufacturer placing devices on the market in its name is required to notify its national competent authorities 
luminex corporation has declared that the lx is and the lx is are classified as a self declaration device and is in conformity with article  article  annex i essential requirements  and annex iii  and the additional provisions of ivdd ec 
however  there can be no assurance that the eu member states will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations 
as the european marketplace continues to be material to our operations  failure by the company or its strategic partners to comply with the directive could have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents environmental we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment 
in the course of our business  we are involved in the handling  storage and disposal of certain chemicals and biohazards 
the laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment 
some of these environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability  rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party 
such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination  including remediation costs  natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of  or conditions caused by  us or others  or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
in addition  where contamination may be present  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury  property damage and recovery of response costs 
although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on  under or from properties owned  leased or operated by us or on  under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal 
these properties may be subject to investigation  remediation and monitoring requirements under federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative  civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities 
we do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted  we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future  or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
moreover  the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations  the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations  or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact our strategic partners  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated component companies 
employees as of march   we had a total of employees and contract employees  including employees acquired effective march  upon the completion of the tm bioscience acquisition  as compared with as of december  at december  we had employees  including contract employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have not experienced any work stoppage 
we believe that relations with our employees are good 
item a 
risk factors we have a limited history of profitability and an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we have incurred significant net losses since our inception  including losses of million for the year ended december  and million in at december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
though we have recently achieved profitability  in order to maintain or increase profitability  we need to continue to generate and sustain substantially higher revenue while achieving reasonable cost and expense levels 
if we fail to maintain or increase profitability in line with the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
furthermore  as we continue to utilize cash to support operations  acquisitions  and research and development efforts  we may further decrease the cash available to the company 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments totaled million  an increase of million from million at december   primarily attributable to more efficient management of our balance sheet and achievement of profitability in 
table of contents we expect our operating results to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the sale of our bioassay testing devices typically involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital by partners 
accordingly  the sales cycle associated with our products typically is lengthy and subject to a number of significant risks  including partners budgetary constraints  inventory management practices  regulatory approval and internal acceptance reviews  all of which are beyond our control 
as a result of this lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle  our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
the vast majority of our system sales are made to our strategic partners 
our partners typically purchase instruments in three phases during their commercialization cycle first  instruments necessary to support internal assay development  second  instruments for sales force demonstrations  and finally  instruments for resale to their customers 
as a result  most of our system placements are highly dependent on the commercialization timetables of our strategic partners and can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as our strategic partners move from phase to phase 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
because of the effect of bulk purchases  we continue to experience fluctuations in the percentage of our quarterly revenues derived from our highest margin items  consumables and royalties 
our gross margin percentage is highly dependent upon the mix of revenue components each quarter 
these fluctuations contribute to the variability and lack of predictability of both gross margin percentage and total gross profit from quarter to quarter 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
we may be unsuccessful in implementing our acquisition strategy 
we may face difficulties integrating acquired entities with our existing businesses 
acquisitions of assets or entities designed to accelerate the implementation of our strategic plan are an element of our long term strategy 
we may be unable to identify and complete appropriate acquisitions in a timely manner and no assurance can be provided that the market price of potential business acquisitions will be acceptable 
in addition  many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have and may be willing to pay more for these businesses or selected assets 
should we identify suitable acquisition targets  we may be unable to complete acquisitions or obtain the financing  if necessary  for these acquisitions on terms favorable to us 
potential acquisitions pose a number of risks  including  among others  that we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions on our business  future acquisitions may require us to assume liabilities  incur large and immediate write offs  issue capital stock potentially dilutive to our stockholders or spend significant cash or may result in a decrease in our future operating income or operating margins  we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits and synergies from acquisitions as a result of inherent risks and uncertainties  including difficulties integrating acquired businesses or retaining their key personnel  partners  customers or other key relationships  entering market segments in which we have no or limited experience  and risks that acquired entities may not operate profitably or that acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance  and acquisitions and subsequent integration of these companies may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities 
other risks of integration include disparate information technology  internal control  financial reporting and record keeping systems  differences in accounting policies  including those requiring judgment or complex estimation processes  new partners or customers who may operate on terms and programs different than ours  additional employees not familiar with our operations  
table of contents facilities or operations in remote locations or potentially foreign jurisdictions and the inherent risks of operating in unfamiliar legal and regulatory environments  and new products  including the risk that any underlying intellectual property associated with such products may not have been adequately protected or that such products may infringe on the proprietary rights of others 
our acquisition of tm bioscience was completed on march  and our operations will be subject to these integration risks as we attempt to integrate the tm bioscience business within our own in and beyond 
our success depends largely on the establishment and maintenance of successful relationships with our strategic partners 
currently  a limited number of strategic partners constitute a majority of our revenue and the loss of any one of these partners could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the development and commercialization of our xmap technology is highly dependent on our ability to establish successful strategic relationships with a number of partners 
as of december   we had strategic partners who were paying royalties and had either commercialized products using the luminex platform or were reselling our products 
furthermore  for the year ended december   two partners individually represented greater than of the company s revenue and collectively represented of total revenue bio rad laboratories  inc  one lambda  inc 

we had four additional partners who individually represented or more of our total revenue and collectively represented of the company s revenue for the year ended december  in total  for the year ended december   we had six partners who represented of our total revenue 
for comparative purposes for the year ended december   two partners individually represented greater than of the company s revenue and collectively represented of our total revenue 
we had three additional partners who individually represented or more of our total revenue and collectively represented of the company s revenue for the year ended december  in total  for the year ended december   we had five partners who represented of our total revenue 
the loss of any of our significant strategic partners  or any of our significant customers  could have a material adverse effect on our growth and future results of operations 
delays in implementation  delays in obtaining regulatory approval  changes in strategy or the financial difficulty of our strategic partners for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to enter into agreements with additional strategic partners depends in part on convincing them that our technology can help achieve and accelerate their goals or efforts 
we will expend substantial funds and management efforts  including through the lbg  with no assurance that any additional strategic relationships will result 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to negotiate additional strategic agreements in the future on acceptable terms  if at all  or that current or future strategic partners will not pursue or develop alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
some of the companies we are targeting as strategic partners offer products competitive with our xmap technology  which may hinder or prevent strategic relationships 
termination of strategic relationships  or the failure to enter into a sufficient number of additional agreements on favorable terms  could reduce sales of our products  lower margins on our products and limit the creation of market demand and acceptance 
in addition  we have entered into non exclusive relationships with most of our existing strategic partners 
the lack of exclusivity could deter existing strategic partners from commercializing xmap technology and may deter new strategic partners from entering into agreements with luminex 
the majority of our future revenues will come from sales of our systems and the development and sale of bioassay kits utilizing our technology by our strategic partners and from use of our technology by our strategic partners in performing services offered to third parties 
we believe that our strategic partners will have economic incentives to develop and market these products  but we cannot predict future sales and royalty revenues because most of our existing strategic partner agreements do not include minimum purchase requirements or royalty commitments 
in addition  we do not have the right or ability to provide incentives to our strategic partners sales personnel to sell products based on xmap technology or to control the timing of the release of products by our strategic partners 
the amount of these revenues will depend on a variety of factors that are outside our control  including the amount and timing of resources that current and future strategic partners devote to develop and market products incorporating our technology 
further  the development and marketing of certain bioassay kits will require 
table of contents our strategic partners to obtain governmental approvals  which could delay or prevent their commercialization efforts 
if our current or future strategic partners do not successfully develop and market products based on our technology and obtain necessary government approvals  our revenues from product sales and royalties will be significantly reduced 
if our technology and products do not become widely used in the life sciences industry  it is unlikely that we can maintain or increase profitability 
life sciences companies have historically conducted biological tests using a variety of technologies  including bead based analysis 
our xmap technology is relatively new and unproven  in certain testing areas  and the use of our technology by life sciences companies is limited 
the commercial success of our technology will depend upon its widespread adoption as a method to perform bioassays 
in order to be successful  we must convince potential partners to utilize our system instead of competing technologies 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to convince prospective strategic partners and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies for pharmaceutical  research  clinical and biomedical testing and analysis  encourage these partners to develop and market products using our technology  manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and at an acceptable cost  obtain and maintain sufficient pricing and royalties from partners on such luminex products  and place and service sufficient quantities of our products  including the ability to provide the level of service required in the mainstream clinical diagnostics market segment 
because of these and other factors  our products may not gain or sustain sufficient market acceptance to maintain or increase profitability 
our reliance on strategic partners to market our products makes forecasting difficult 
primarily as a result of our reliance on partner performance  it is difficult to accurately forecast future operating results 
our operating expenses are largely based on anticipated revenue trends  and a high percentage of our expenses are  and will continue to be  fixed in the short term 
the level of our revenues will depend upon the rate and timing of the adoption of our technology as a method to perform bioassays 
due to our limited operating history  predicting this timing and rate of adoption is difficult 
in addition  we currently anticipate that the vast majority of future sales of our products and products incorporating our technology will be made by our strategic partners 
for the following reasons  estimating the timing and amount of sales of these products that may be made by our strategic partners is particularly difficult we have no control over the timing or extent of product development  marketing or sale of our products by our strategic partners 
most of our strategic partners are not committed to minimum purchase commitments  and we do not control the incentives provided by our strategic partners to their sales personnel 
a significant number of our strategic partners intend to produce clinical diagnostic applications that may need to be approved by the food and drug administration  or other regulatory bodies in jurisdictions outside of the united states 
certain strategic partners may have unique requirements for their applications and systems 
assisting the various strategic partners may strain our research and development and manufacturing resources 
to the extent that we are not able to timely assist our strategic partners  the commercialization of their products will likely be delayed 

table of contents certain strategic partners may fail to deliver products that satisfy market requirements  or such products may fail to perform properly 
we have limited access to partner confidential corporate information 
a sudden unexpected change in ownership  strategy or other material event could adversely impact partner purchases of our products 
the life sciences industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change  and we may not have the resources necessary to compete successfully 
we compete with companies in the united states and abroad that are engaged in the development and production of similar products 
we will continue to face intense competition from existing competitors and other companies seeking to develop new technologies 
many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  scientific  research  marketing  sales  distribution  service and other resources than we do 
these companies may develop technologies that are superior alternatives to our technologies or may be more effective at commercializing their technologies in products 
the life sciences industry is characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation 
we may need to develop new technologies for our products to remain competitive 
one or more of our current or future competitors could render our present or future products obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances 
in addition  the introduction or announcement of new products by us or others could result in a delay of or decrease in sales of existing products  as we await regulatory approvals and as customers evaluate these new products 
we may also encounter other problems in the process of delivering new products to the marketplace  including products from our biosciences group  such as problems related to design  development or manufacturing of such products  and as a result we may be unsuccessful in selling such products 
our future success will depend on our ability to compete effectively against current technologies  as well as to respond effectively to technological advances by developing and marketing products that are competitive in the continually changing technological landscape 
our success depends on our ability to service and support our products directly or in collaboration with our strategic partners 
to the extent that the company or its strategic partners fail to maintain a high quality level of service and support for xmap technology products  there is a risk that the perceived quality of our xmap technology products will be diminished in the marketplace 
likewise  the company may fail to provide the level  quantity or quality  of service expected by the marketplace 
this could result in slower adoption rates and lower than anticipated utilization of xmap products causing a material adverse affect on our business 
the intellectual property rights we rely upon to protect the technology underlying our products may not be adequate to maintain market exclusivity 
inadequate intellectual property protection could enable third parties to exploit our technology or use very similar technology and could reduce our ability to distinguish our products in the market 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain  protect and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets  including the intellectual property of entities we may acquire 
any patents we own may not afford full protection for our technology and products 
others may challenge our patents and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed or invalidated 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the united states or foreign countries 
competitors may develop products that are not covered by our patents 
further  there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the us patent and trademark office  and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years 
we have obtained patents in the united states and foreign jurisdictions directed to various aspects and applications of our technology 
we have pending applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions 
in japan  due to a procedural omission  we are unable to obtain patent protection for our method of real time detection and quantification of multiple analytes from a single sample similar to the protection we have obtained in the united states 
although we are pursuing patent protection in japan for other aspects of our technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and marketing technologies similar to our xmap technology in 
table of contents japan 
effective with our acquisition of tm bioscience  the company now has an additional issued patents and pending patent applications 
we require our employees  consultants  strategic partners and other third parties to execute confidentiality agreements 
our employees and third party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original expressions and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
in addition  the company has implemented a patent process to file patent applications on its key technology 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements or this patent process will provide us with adequate protection against improper use of our intellectual property or disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  in some situations  these agreements may conflict with  or be subject to  the rights of third parties with whom our employees  consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market 
in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may have to initiate legal proceedings against third parties  such as infringement suits or interference proceedings 
these legal proceedings could be expensive  take significant time and or divert management s attention from other business concerns 
these proceedings may cause us to lose the benefit of some of our intellectual property rights  the loss of which may inhibit or preclude our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market 
we also may provoke these third parties to assert claims against us 
the patent position of companies like ours generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
no consistent policy has emerged from the us patent and trademark office or the courts regarding the breadth of claims allowed or the degree of protection afforded under patents like ours 
our success will depend partly on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
we may be sued for infringing the intellectual property rights of others  including claims with respect to intellectual property of entities we may acquire 
in addition  we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court that we do not infringe on the proprietary rights of others or that their rights are invalid or unenforceable 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  the cost of such litigation could affect our profitability 
furthermore  litigation is time consuming and could divert management s attention and resources away from our business 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  we may have to pay damages and could be required to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license 
any required license may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to sell some of our products  which could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are aware of a european patent granted to dr 
ioannis tripatzis  which covers certain testing agents and certain methods of their use 
dr 
tripatzis has publicly stated his belief that his european patent covers aspects of our technology if practiced in europe 
this european patent expired in november we have only produced our products in limited quantities  and we may experience problems in scaling our manufacturing operations or delays or component shortages that could limit the growth of our revenue 
to date  we have produced our products in limited quantities compared to the quantities necessary to achieve desired revenue growth 
we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities or maintain consistency between differing lots of consumables 
if we encounter difficulties in scaling our manufacturing operations as a result of  among other things  quality control and quality assurance and availability of component and raw material supplies  we will likely experience reduced sales of our products  increased repair or re engineering costs due to product returns and defects and increased expenses due to switching to alternate suppliers  any of which would reduce our revenues and gross margins 

table of contents we presently outsource certain aspects of the assembly of our systems to contract manufacturers 
because of a long lead time to delivery  we are required to place orders for a variety of items well in advance of scheduled production runs 
we recently increased our flexibility to purchase strategic components within shorter lead times by entering into supply agreements with the suppliers of these components 
although we attempt to match our parts inventory and production capabilities to estimates of marketplace demand  to the extent system orders materially vary from our estimates  we may experience continued constraints in our systems production and delivery capacity  which could adversely impact revenue in a given fiscal period 
should the company s need for raw materials and components used in production continue to fluctuate  we could incur additional costs associated with either expediting or postponing delivery of those materials 
in an effort to control costs  in the last quarter of manufacturing implemented a lean production system 
managing the change from discrete to continuous flow production requires time and management commitment 
implementation of lean initiatives and our supply chain capabilities may result in part shortages that delay shipments and cause fluctuations in revenue in a given period 
certain key components of our product line are currently purchased from a limited number of outside sources and may only be available through a limited number of providers 
we do not have agreements with all of our suppliers 
our reliance on our suppliers and contract manufacturers exposes us to risks including the possibility that one or more of our suppliers or our assemblers that do not have supply agreements with the company could terminate their services at any time without penalty  the potential obsolescence and or inability of our suppliers to obtain required components  the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternate sources of supply or manufacturing services  the inability to qualify alternate sources without impacting performance claims of our products  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternate suppliers or assemblers  and increases in prices of raw materials and key components 
consequently  in the event that supplies of components or work performed by any of our assemblers are delayed or interrupted for any reason  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired 
the capital spending policies of our customers has a significant effect on the demand for our products 
customers include clinical diagnostic  pharmaceutical  biotechnological  chemical and industrial companies  and the capital spending policies of these companies can have a significant effect on the demand for our products 
these policies are based on a wide variety of factors  including governmental regulation or price controls  the resources available for purchasing research equipment  the spending priorities among various types of analytical equipment and the policies regarding capital expenditures during recessionary periods 
any decrease in capital spending by life sciences companies could cause our revenues to decline 
as a result  we are subject to significant volatility in revenue 
therefore  our operating results can be materially affected negatively and positively by the spending policies and priorities of our customers 
if we fail to comply with government regulations that affect our business  we could be subject to enforcement actions  injunctions and civil and criminal penalties that could delay or prevent marketing of our products 
the production  testing  labeling  marketing and distribution of our products for some purposes and products based on our technology are subject to governmental regulation by the united states food and drug administration fda and by similar agencies in other countries 
some of our products and products based on our technology for in vitro diagnostic purposes are subject to clearance by the fda prior to marketing for commercial use 
to date  strategic partners have obtained such clearances 
others are anticipated 
the process of obtaining necessary fda clearances can be time consuming  expensive and uncertain 
further  clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or to whom it may be marketed 
in addition  because some of 
table of contents our products employ laser technology  we are also required to comply with fda requirements relating to radiation performance safety standards cfr and 
in addition  the fda recently issued a draft guidance document entitled commercially distributed analyte specific reagents frequently asked questions  dated september  asr guidance document and separate guidance document entitled in vitro multivariate index assays dated september  mia guidance document 
while both documents are in draft form  they may  if finalized  limit or delay distribution of assays on our platform to the extent additional regulatory clearance is required prior to distribution 
cleared medical device products are subject to continuing fda requirements relating to  among others  manufacturing quality control and quality assurance  maintenance of records and documentation  registration and listing  import export  adverse event and other reporting  distribution  labeling and promotion and advertising of medical devices 
our inability  or the inability of our strategic partners  to obtain required regulatory approval or clearance on a timely or acceptable basis could harm our business 
in addition  failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could subject us or our strategic partners to regulatory enforcement action  including warning letters  product seizures  recalls  withdrawal of clearances  restrictions on or injunctions against marketing our products or products based on our technology  and civil and criminal penalties 
medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside the united states 
these range from comprehensive device clearance requirements for some or all of our medical device products to requests for product data or certifications 
as part of the council directive of february  weee  we are expected to comply with certain requirements regarding the labeling of our products containing electronic devices beginning on august  in each of the eu member states where our regulated products are distributed 
while we are taking steps to comply with the requirements of weee  we cannot be certain that we will comply with the national stage implementation of weee in all member states 
our products are currently exempt from the council directive of january   restriction of hazardous substances rohs  which requires the removal of certain specified hazardous substances for certain products beginning july  in each of the member states 
however  the european union has indicated that it may include medical devices  including some of our products  under the jurisdiction of rohs 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state and foreign medical device laws and regulations may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other laws and regulations relating to  among other things  environmental protection and work place safety 
our strategic partners and customers expect our organization to operate on an established quality management system compliant with fda quality system regulations and industry standards  the in vitro diagnostic directive ec of october directive as implemented nationally in the eu member states and industry standards  such as iso we became iso certified in march and self declared our luminex and luminex devices are in conformity with article  article  annex i essential requirements  and annex iii  and the additional provisions of the directive as of december  subsequent audits are carried out annually to ensure we maintain our system in substantial compliance with iso and other applicable regulations and industry standards 
we became iso and canadian medical device conformity assessment system cmdcas certified in july in august a level ii qsit contract inspection was conducted in accordance with cpgm  inspection of medical device manufacturers  pac b  medical device level ii inspections pursuant to the fda dallas district office fy workplan and the dshs drugs medical device group fy workplan 
the inspection is closed under cfr d and the establishment inspection report no 
provided in accordance with the foia and cfr part no dshs form e or fda form was issued 
failure to maintain compliance with fda  cmdcas and eu regulations and other medical device laws  or to obtain applicable registrations where required  could reduce our competitive advantage in the markets in which we compete and also decrease satisfaction and confidence levels with our partners 
if we become subject to product liability claims  we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of biotechnological  human including genetic diagnostic and therapeutic products 
although we believe that we are reasonably insured against these risks and we generally have limited indemnity protections in our 
table of contents supplier agreements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain insurance in amounts or scope sufficient to provide us with adequate coverage against all potential liabilities 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage or claim that is outside or exceeds our indemnity protections in our supplier agreements or a recall of one of our products would have to be paid out of our cash reserves 
if third party payors increasingly restrict payments for healthcare expenses or fail to adequately pay for multi analyte testing  we may experience reduced sales which would hurt our business and our business prospects 
third party payors  such as government entities and healthcare programs  health maintenance organizations and private insurers  are continually seeking to reduce healthcare expenses 
the federal government has also recently reduced the funding for certain government sponsored healthcare programs which has caused these third party payors to seek further reduction in medical expenses 
these reductions may decrease demand for our products and the price we can charge 
increasingly  medicaid and other third party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical services  including clinical diagnostic tests 
they are also attempting to contain costs by limiting coverage and the reimbursement level of tests and other healthcare products 
in addition  cost containment initiatives by governmental or educational entities or programs may reduce funding for genetic research and development activities and retard the growth of the genetic testing marketing 
without adequate coverage and reimbursement  consumer demand for tests will decrease 
decreased demand could cause sales of our products  and sales and services by our strategic partners  to fall 
in addition  decreased demand could place pressure on us  or our strategic partners  to lower prices on these products or services  resulting in lower margins 
reduced sales or margins by us  or our strategic partners  would hurt our business  profitability and business prospects 
we may in the future incur substantial debt obligations pursuant to our new credit facility that could restrict our operations 
we may incur up to a maximum aggregate amount of million of principal indebtedness  subject to certain borrowing base limitations  in the future pursuant to our new revolving credit facility for  among other purposes  funding operating expenses and or costs related to future expansions and acquisitions 
this indebtedness could have adverse consequences on us  including limiting our ability to compete and our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  limiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital  capital and research and development expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  and exposing us to interest rate risk since the interest rate on borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be variable 
to the extent incurred  our debt service obligations will require us to use a portion of our operating cash flow to pay interest and principal on indebtedness instead of for other corporate purposes  including funding future expansion of our business and ongoing capital expenditures 
our ability to repay or refinance our debt will depend on our successful financial and operating performance 
our financial and operating performance depends upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  as further described in these risk factors 
in addition  the documents governing our new revolving credit facility contain various restrictions and covenants as a condition to borrowing or maintaining indebtedness  including a tangible net worth requirement  liquidity requirements  and limitations on acquisitions and additional indebtedness  that may restrict our financial and operating flexibility  and our ability to make certain acquisitions and declare dividends 
our ability to satisfy these covenants can be affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  as further described in these risk factors  and we cannot assure you that we will be able satisfy them 
we rely on the innovation and resources of larger industry participants and public programs to advance genomic research and educate physicians clinicians on genetic diagnostics 
the linkages between genetic anomalies that the company s products detect and the underlying disease states are not always fully medically correlated 
additionally  the availability of correlated genetic markers is dependent on 
table of contents significant investment in genomic research  often funded through public programs for which there are no assurances of on going support 
should any government limit patent rights to specific genetic materials  private investment in this area could also be significantly curtailed 
in addition  the adoption of genetic diagnostics is dependent to a great extent on the education and training of physicians and clinicians 
the company does not have the resources to undertake such training  and is relying on larger industry participants and professional medical colleges to establish  communicate and educate physicians and clinicians on best practices related to genetic diagnostics 
we are subject to evolving legislative  judicial and ethical standards on use of technology and biotechnology 
the adoption of genetic testing is occurring within the broader context of a myriad of decisions related to genetic patenting and genotyping 
issues associated with health insurance  data access  intellectual property protection  national and international legislative initiatives and other variables may have a significant impact on the wide spread adoption of genetic testing or on specific segments or tests within the genetic testing market 
our operating results may be affected by current economic and political conditions 
the continuing events in asia and the middle east and concern for future terrorist attacks  leave many economic and political uncertainties 
furthermore  foreign stock markets have been volatile and equally sensitive to global geopolitical concerns and terrorist threats 
these uncertainties could adversely affect our business and revenues in the short or long term in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
international business operations create additional operational and legal risk 
our operations outside the united states are subject to additional risks  including changes in or interpretations of foreign law that may adversely affect our ability to sell our products  perform services or repatriate profits to the united states  the imposition of tariffs  hyperinflation or economic or political instability in foreign countries  imposition of limitations on or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  conducting business in places where business practices and customs are unfamiliar and unknown  the imposition of restrictive trade policies  including export restrictions  worldwide political conditions  the imposition of inconsistent laws or regulations  the imposition or increase of investment requirements and other restrictions by foreign governments  longer collection cycles for account receivables  uncertainties relating to foreign laws  including labor laws  and legal proceedings  currency exchange rate risks  having to comply with a variety of us laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act  and having to comply with us export control regulations and policies that restrict our ability to communicate with non us employees and supply foreign affiliates  partners and customers 
our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain our management and staff 
we depend on the principal members of our management and scientific staff  including our chief executive officer  marketing  research and development  technical support  technical service and sales staff 
the loss of 
table of contents services of key members of management could delay or reduce our product development  marketing and sales and technical support efforts 
in addition  recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and other personnel to perform research and development  technical support  technical service and marketing and sales work will be critical to our success 
there is a shortage in our industry of qualified management and scientific personnel  and competition for these individuals is intense 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract additional and retain existing personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives 
our stock price has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price 
this volatility is in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results from historical results or estimates of results prepared by securities analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  conditions or trends in the life science  biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  additions or departures of key personnel  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  general economic conditions and interest rates  instability in the united states and other financial markets and the ongoing and possible escalation of unrest in the middle east  other armed hostilities or further acts or threats of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere  sales of our common stock  and the potential adverse impact of the secondary trading of our stock on foreign exchanges which are subject to less regulatory oversight than the nasdaq global market  without our permission  and the activity of the market makers of our stock on such exchanges  including the risk that such market makers may engage in naked short sales and or other deceptive trading practices which may artificially depress or otherwise affect the price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for technology companies in particular  has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
further  there has been particular volatility in the market prices of securities of life sciences companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted 
a securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs  potential liabilities and the diversion of management s attention and resources 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan and delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and stockholder rights plan contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are also subject to certain provisions of delaware law that could delay  deter or prevent a change in control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we develop  manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies with applications throughout the life sciences industry 
our xmap technology  an open architecture  multiplexing technology  allows simultaneous analysis of up to bioassays from a small sample volume  typically a single drop of fluid  by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres 
xmap technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers  digital signal processors and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed  precision  flexibility and cost 
our xmap technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry which includes the fields of drug discovery and development  clinical diagnostics  genetic analysis  bio defense  protein analysis and biomedical research 
our end user customers and partners  which include laboratory professionals performing research  clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by a physician and other laboratories  have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible 
luminex has adopted a business model built around strategic partnerships 
the company has licensed its xmap technology to other companies  who then develop products that incorporate the xmap technology into products that they sell to the end user 
luminex develops and manufactures the proprietary xmap laboratory instrumentation and the proprietary xmap microspheres and sells these products to its partners 
our partners then sell xmap instrumentation and xmap based reagent consumable products  which run on the instrumentation  to the end user laboratory 
the company was founded on this model  and our success to date has been due to this model 
as of the end of  luminex had over strategic partners  of which have released commercialized reagent based products using our technology  and these partners had sold and placed over  xmap based instruments in laboratories worldwide 
luminex has several forms of revenue that result from this partner model system revenue is generated from the sale of our xmap systems and peripherals 
currently system revenue is derived from the sale of the luminex and analyzers often coupled with an optional xy platform and or sheath delivery system 
we currently expect the average system price to be between  and  in a given reporting period 
consumable revenue is generated from the sale of our dyed polystyrene microspheres and sheath fluid 
our larger commercial and development partners often purchase these consumables in bulk to minimize the number of incoming qualification events and to allow for longer development and production runs 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells a kit incorporating our proprietary microspheres to an end user or when a partner utilizes a kit to provide a testing result to a user 
end users can be facilities such as testing labs  development facilities and research facilities who buy prepared kits and have specific testing needs or testing service companies that provide assay results to pharmaceutical research companies or physicians 
service revenue is generated when a partner or other owner of a system purchases a service contract from us after the warranty has expired 
service contract revenue is amortized over the life of the contract and the costs associated with those contracts are recognized as incurred 
other revenue consists of items such as training  shipping  parts sales  license revenue  grant revenue and other items that individually amount to less than of total revenue 
currently revenue generated from the luminex bioscience group lbg is recorded in other revenue 
the lbg develops assays for either direct sale in markets in which we have no partners with commercial rights or for distribution in our partner product pipeline 

table of contents grant activity during  we were awarded two government grants 
one grant is from the defense advanced research projects agency to develop a chip scale biological pathogen detection technology that could lead to a high performance  low cost and portable instrument with applications in biological agent sensing and military diagnostics 
this grant will allow us to accelerate our product development of related commercial products such as a point of care diagnostic instrument and is specifically designed to shrink both the cost and size of our current instrument 
we also received grant funding from the homeland security advanced research projects agency as part of their low cost biological agent detection system program 
in this program  luminex will work as a sub contractor to smiths detection to develop a low cost early warning trigger sensor for detection of biological agents present in the environment 
we believe these government grants are significant because they help support our r d efforts  establish our footprint in the bio defense sector and open the door for future grants 
highlights luminex grew total revenue by approximately over revenue of million net profit of approximately million representing our first profitable year gross margin percentage of  up from for increase in r d investment of approximately launch of first lbg products a pneumococccal assay and a mirna assay announcement of the tm bioscience acquisition cumulative system sales to date of over  systems  worldwide secured two government grants to help fund core research and development recent acquisition of tm bioscience in december of  we announced our agreement to acquire tm bioscience tm of toronto  canada 
the transaction was completed on march  this was a stock for stock acquisition  and it is  what we believe to be  a logical extension of our strategy 
we believe the molecular diagnostics market will be one of the fastest growing life sciences market segments over the next years  and one where multiplexing capability will be key to success 
the acquired company will be referred to as luminex molecular diagnostics lmd and will be primarily focused on dna based research and diagnostics 
the focus of lmd will be to design  develop  manufacture and commercialize nucleic acid based testing products to become a leader in genetic testing  personalized medicine and infectious disease 
we exchanged 
luminex common shares for each outstanding tm share upon the closing of the merger  that will result in the issuance of approximately million shares of luminex common stock 
we also agreed to assume all outstanding tm options and warrants according to the applicable tm plan provisions  which options and warrants are potentially exercisable for approximately  additional shares of luminex common stock on an as converted basis 
as part of the acquisition  we retired approximately million of tm funded debt from our existing cash reserves 
the impact of the acquisition on our liquidity is more fully described under liquidity and capital resources 
future operations we continue to expect revenue growth for to be driven by sustained adoption of our core technology coupled with assay introduction and commercialization by both the lbg and the new lmd 
the anticipated continued shift in revenue concentration towards higher margin items  such as assays  consumables and royalties should provide favorable gross margins 
additionally  we believe that a sustained investment into r d is necessary in order to meet the needs of our marketplace and estimate that spending will approximate of total revenues 
finally  we believe our partner model allows us to leverage our operating expenses which  assuming the revenue increases and r d expense described above  should allow us to generate increased operating income for as a percentage of total revenue from our core business 

table of contents we expect our primary challenges in to be increased traction of partner products incorporating luminex technology  realizing the anticipated synergies of the tm acquisition and associated integration risks  commercialization and market adoption of output from the lbg and lmd group and expanding our footprint and reputation within our identified target market segments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is described in note of our consolidated financial statements provided herein in item estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue on sales of our products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
generally  these criteria are met at the time our product is shipped 
if the criteria for revenue recognition are not met at the time of shipment  the revenue is deferred until all criteria are met 
royalty revenue is generated when a partner sells products incorporating our technology  provides testing services to third parties using our technology or resells our consumables 
royalty revenue is recognized as it is reported to us by our partners  therefore  the underlying end user sales may be related to prior periods 
we also sell extended service contracts for maintenance and support of our products 
revenue for service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
total deferred revenue as of december  was million and primarily consisted of i unamortized license fees for non exclusive licenses and patent rights to certain luminex technologies in the amount of million  ii unamortized revenue related to extended service contracts in the amount of million  and iii upfront payments from strategic partners to be used for the purchase of products or to be applied towards future royalty payments in the amount of  upfront payments from our strategic partners are nonrefundable and will be recognized as revenue as our strategic partners purchase products or apply such amounts against royalty payments 
nonrefundable license fees are amortized into revenue over the estimated life of the license agreements 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
at december   the two major components of the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory were i a specific reserve for inventory items that we no longer use in the manufacture of our products or that no longer meet our specifications and ii a reserve against slow moving items for potential obsolescence 
the total estimated allowance is reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses historically have been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of our significant customers  or a deterioration in the economic environment  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts

included therein  luminex retired million of tm funded debt and expects to incur approximately million of expense associated with advisors  consultants  and other transaction related costs in connection with the acquisition 
as a result of the acquisition  infrastructure enhancements to support the acquisition and the dilutive nature of the acquisition  we expect operating cash flow to result in a net use of cash 

table of contents our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including our success in developing and expanding markets for our products  payments under possible future strategic arrangements  continued progress of our research and development of potential products  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the need to acquire licenses to new technology  costs associated with strategic acquisitions including integration costs and assumed liabilities  the status of competitive products and potential cost associated with both protecting and defending our intellectual property 
additionally  actions taken based on recommendations of our strategic consulting study or the ongoing internal evaluation of our business could result in expenditures not currently contemplated in our estimates for we believe  however  that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with availability under our new credit facility as described below are sufficient to fund our operating expenses  capital equipment requirements and other expected liquidity requirements through based upon our current operating plan and structure  management anticipates total cash use for to be approximately to million  giving us an anticipated balance in cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments at december  of to million 
factors that could affect this estimate  in addition to those listed above  include i continued collections of accounts receivable consistent with our historical experience  ii our ability to manage our inventory levels consistent with past practices  iii settlement of other accrued liabilities  iv signing of partnership agreements which include significant up front license fees  and v unanticipated costs associated with  and negative operating cash flows resulting from  the tm acquisition

risk factors above 
on march   the company entered into a senior revolving credit facility with jpmorgan chase bank  na  which provides borrowings of up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding of million based on availability under a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts and inventory 
the obligations under the senior revolving credit facility are guaranteed by the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of the company and secured by all of the accounts  equipment inventory and general intangibles excluding intellectual property of the company and the guarantors including the pledge of an intercomany note from tm bioscience and payable to the company 
loans under the senior credit facility accrue interest on the basis of either a base rate or a libor rate 
the base rate is calculated daily and is the greater of i prime minus and ii federal funds rate plus 
borrowings at the libor rate are based on one  two or three month periods and interest is calculated by taking the sum of i the product of libor for such period and statutory reserves plus ii 
we pay a fee of per annum on the unfunded portion of the lender s aggregate commitment under the facility 
the senior credit facility contains conditions to making loans  representations  warranties and covenants  including financial covenants customary for a transaction of this type 
financial covenants include i a tangible net worth covenant of million prior to the acquisition tm bioscience and million following the acquisition and ii a liquidity requirement of availability not less than the funded debt of the company and its subsidiaries including tm bioscience calculated using the unencumbered cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of the company and the guarantors 
the senior credit facility also contains customary events of default as well as restrictions on undertaking certain specified corporate actions  including  among others  asset dispositions  acquisitions and other investments  dividends  fundamental corporate changes such as mergers and consolidations  incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens and negative pledges  transactions with affiliates and agreements as to certain subsidiary restrictions and the creation of additional subsidiaries 
if an event of default occurs that is not otherwise waived or cured  the lender may terminate its obligations to make loans under the senior credit facility and may declare the loans then outstanding under the senior credit facility to be due and payable 
we believe we are currently in compliance with our financial and other covenants under the senior credit facility 
as of march   no amounts were outstanding under the senior revolving credit facility 
to the extent capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and deployment of our technologies 
there can be no assurance that debt or equity funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of those securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
moreover  incurring debt financing under our new credit facility or otherwise could result in a substantial portion of our operating cash flow being dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  could render us more vulnerable to competitive pressures and economic downturns and could impose restrictions on our operations 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds through entering into agreements on unattractive terms 

table of contents contractual obligations we currently have approximately million in non cancelable obligations for the next months 
these obligations are included in our estimated cash usage during the following table reflects the company s total current non cancelable obligations by period in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years non cancelable rental obligations non cancelable purchase obligations total purchase obligations include contractual arrangements in the form of purchase orders primarily a result of normal inventory purchases or minimum payments due resulting when minimum purchase commitments are not met 
purchase obligations relating to purchase orders do not extend beyond a year  however  we would expect future years to have these purchase commitments that will arise in the ordinary course of business and will generally increase or decrease according to fluctuations in overall sales volume 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a direct adverse effect on our operations 
however  a substantial increase in product and manufacturing costs and personnel related expenses could have an adverse impact on our results of operations in the event these expenses increase at a faster pace than we can increase our system  consumable and royalty rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and provides guidance for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on its financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of fin will have a material effect on its financial position and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income received on our cash balances is sensitive to changes in the general level of domestic interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in instruments that meet the definition of cash equivalents or in short term investments and are held to maturity 
a basis point fluctuation from average investment returns at december  would yield an approximate variance in overall investment return 
due to the nature of our investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
the majority of the payments for our products  including sales to foreign customers  are required to be made in us dollars  therefore  we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging activities 
accordingly  our foreign currency and currency market risk is limited 
borrowings from time to time outstanding under our new credit facility will be subject to interest rate risks as the interest under this facility will be variable as described above under liquidity and capital resources
