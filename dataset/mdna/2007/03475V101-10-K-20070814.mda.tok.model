overview angiodynamics is a provider of innovative medical devices used in minimally invasive  image guided procedures to treat peripheral vascular disease  or pvd  and local oncology therapy options for treating cancer  including radiofrequency ablation rf or rfa and systems and embolization products for treating cancerous tumors 
we design  develop  manufacture and market a broad line of therapeutic and diagnostic devices that enable interventional physicians interventional radiologists  vascular surgeons  interventional and surgical oncologists and others to treat pvd  tumors  and other non coronary diseases 
we believe that we are the only company whose primary focus is to offer a comprehensive product line for the interventional treatment of these diseases 
for the past five fiscal years  over of our net sales were from single use  disposable products 
the following table sets forth our aggregate net sales from the following product categories for our last three fiscal years dollars in thousands interventional products oncology products 
total 
we sell our broad line of quality devices in the united states through a direct sales force and outside the us through a combination of direct sales and distributor relationships 
as of july   our sales organization numbered in the us and outside the us for fiscal years   and    and  of our net sales were in non us markets 
our growth depends in large part on the continuous introduction of new and innovative products  together with ongoing enhancements to our existing products  through internal product development  technology licensing and strategic alliances 
for fiscal  about of our net sales were from products introduced in the last five years 
for each of the past three fiscal years  we invested at least of our net sales in research and development r d 
r d expenditures were of net sales for fiscal a significant portion of our r d expenses in related to a non cash charge of million for in process r d required under purchase accounting rules from our acquisition of rita 
without this charge  our r d expenses were approximately of net sales 
we expect that our r d expenditures will reach approximately to of net sales for fiscal and remain at that level thereafter 
however  downturns in our business could cause us to reduce our r d spending 
we are also seeking to grow through selective acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies 
in january  we completed the acquisition of rita 
this acquisition creates a diversified medical technology company with a broad line of access  diagnostic and therapeutic products that enable interventional physicians and surgeons to treat peripheral vascular disease and cancerous tumors 
interventional oncology is a large and growing area for our existing customer base and rita s leadership position  premium products and excellent reputation fit our strategy perfectly 
rita had a very strong position in vascular access ports  which are an ideal sales fit with our morpheus ct picc and the vascular access port technology we purchased from medron in may in addition  our recently acquired irreversible electroporation ire soft tissue ablation technology  which we expect to commercialize in mid  will be complementary to rita s diverse offering of local oncology therapies  which include its market leading rfa systems  habib sealer tm resection devices and lc beads tm for tumor embolization 

table of contents although we completed a public offering of our common stock in fiscal  we used a substantial portion of our available cash in the rita acquisition and our remaining cash resources are somewhat limited 
except to the extent we can further use our equity securities as acquisition capital  we will require additional equity or debt financing to fund any future significant acquisitions 
for fiscal  approximately of our net sales were derived from products manufactured for us by third parties  compared to for fiscal we intend to continue to manufacture more of these products in house to achieve lower product costs and increased profitability 
in and  we expanded our manufacturing facility in queensbury  new york  to provide us with significantly greater manufacturing capacity and to accommodate additional research  development and administrative requirements 
we are not currently operating our manufacturing facilities at full capacity 
however  we anticipate requiring additional administrative and engineering space within the next one to two years 
our ability to further increase our profitability will depend in large part on improving gross profit margins 
factors such as changes in our product mix  new technologies and unforeseen price pressures may cause our margins to grow at a slower rate than we have anticipated or to decline 
recent developments acquisition of rita medical systems  inc on january   we completed the acquisition of rita 
as a result of the acquisition  each outstanding share of common stock of rita was converted into i shares of common stock of angiodynamics and ii in cash 
in connection with the acquisition  the company issued approximately million shares of common stock  assumed outstanding rita options and other convertible securities  which are exercisable for an additional million shares of our common stock and paid approximately million in cash to the former stockholders of rita 
we have accounted for the acquisition of rita as a purchase under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
under the purchase method of accounting  the assets and liabilities of rita were recorded as of the acquisition date  at their respective fair values  and consolidated with those of angiodynamics 
the preparation of the valuation of the fair value of the assets and liabilities of rita required the use of significant assumptions and estimates  specifically expected future cash flows and the applicable discount rates for the acquired intangibles  black scholes assumptions for the valuation of the exchanged options and warrants  and estimates for irc section limitations for the deferred tax assets 
these estimates were based on assumptions that we believed to be reasonable as of the date of acquisition 
however  our actual results may differ from these estimates 
rita s operating results were consolidated with those of angiodynamics beginning on the date of the acquisition  january  since our results are not restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of rita  fluctuations in our operating results for as compared to the prior periods are significantly impacted by the acquisition of rita 
however  we have included supplemental pro forma financial information in note c acquisitions to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report to give effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of each of the periods presented in this form k 
the rita acquisition enhances our overall competitive position and growth potential 
historically  less than of our total sales have come from non us markets 
through rita s direct international sales force in the united kingdom  germany  and france we expect our international sales to increase significantly going forward 
we also expect our combined gross profit margins to improve as a result of rita acquisition  as rita s gross profit margins have historically been higher than angiodynamics  on a stand alone basis 

table of contents subsequent to the acquisition  we classify our revenues into two product groups interventional products and oncology products 
the interventional products group includes our angiographic  thrombolytic  dialysis  image guided vascular access igva  pta  venous  and drainage products 
the oncology products group includes the rfa  embolization and surgical resection products acquired in the rita transaction 
rita s port product line  hemodialysis catheter  venous catheter  needles  and picc s are part of the interventional products group 
facility expansion in september  we broke ground on a  square foot expansion at our queensbury  ny headquarters 
the expansion will include increased warehouse and distribution space to support projected growth in the company s core business 
the building project  which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of fiscal  will help ensure we have adequate capacity to support our fast growing customer base 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note a to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all these significant accounting policies affect the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations  we view certain of these policies as critical 
policies determined to be critical are those policies that have the most significant impact on our financial statements and require us to use a greater degree of judgment and or estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
the accounting policies identified as critical are as follows revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
decisions relative to criterion iii regarding collectibility are based upon our judgments  as discussed under accounts receivable below  and should conditions change in the future and cause us to determine this criterion is not met  our results of operations may be affected 
we recognize revenue  net of sales taxes assessed by any governmental authority  as products are shipped  based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate shipping and credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved by us and customers may be subject to a restocking charge 
to be accepted  a returned product must be unadulterated  undamaged and have at least months remaining prior to its expiration date 
accounts receivable accounts receivable  principally trade  are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor aging reports  collections and payments from customers  and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that the same credit loss rates will be experienced in the future 
we write off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible 
for fiscal years   and  our write offs of accounts receivable aggregated  
table of contents income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we calculate income tax expense for each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this involves estimating actual current taxes due plus assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment for tax and accounting purposes that are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we periodically evaluate deferred tax assets  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards to determine their recoverability based primarily on our ability to generate future taxable income and capital gains 
where their recovery is not likely  we estimate a valuation allowance and record a corresponding additional tax expense in our statement of operations 
if actual results differ from our estimates due to changes in assumptions  the provision for income taxes could be materially affected 
as of june   our valuation allowance and net deferred tax asset were approximately million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax asset includes million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards acquired as part of the rita acquisition 
these losses could be significantly limited under internal revenue code irc section our analysis of rita s ownership changes as defined in irc section shows that approximately million of federal net operating losses and million of state net operating losses will expire prior to utilization 
the gross deferred tax asset related to the net operating losses reflects this limitation 
we need to generate approximately million of taxable income in each year over the next nineteen years to ensure the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
after taking into consideration the charges for purchased r d and litigation damage award we have determined that we have sufficient existing levels of pre tax earnings to generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet 
in order to support the realizability of our net deferred tax asset  we projected our pre tax income utilizing historical results 
utilizing this projected pre tax income  we have projected taxable income taking into consideration existing levels of permanent differences including stock option exercise deductions and non deductible expenses and the reversal of significant temporary differences including the litigation damage award and acquired intangibles 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards as of june  after considering irc section limitations are million 
the expiration of the federal net operating loss carryforwards are as follows 
million expire between and  million expire between and  and million expire between and our state net operating loss carryforwards as of june  after considering irc section limitations are million which expire in various years from to we have a tax allocation and indemnification agreement with e z em with whom we have filed consolidated federal tax returns for periods through october  under this agreement  we paid federal income tax based on the amount of taxable income we generated and were credited for federal tax benefits we generated that were used by us or other members of the consolidated group 
this agreement does not cover tax liabilities arising from state  local and other taxing authorities to whom we report separately 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position sfas no 
r  transition election to accounting for the tax effect of share based payment awards 
we have elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
under the modified prospective transition method  no adjustment is made to the deferred tax balances associated with stock based payments that continue to be classified as equity awards 
additionally  we elected to use the long form method  as provided in paragraph of sfas no 
r to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
the long form method requires us to analyze the book and tax compensation for each award separately as if it had been issued following the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 subject to adjustments for net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents inventories we value inventories at the lower of cost on the first in  first out method or market 
on a quarterly basis  we review inventory quantities on hand and analyze the provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on product expiration dating and our estimated sales forecast  which is based on sales history and anticipated future demand 
our estimates of future product demand may not be accurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
accordingly  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and results of operations 
as of june   june   and may   our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was   and  respectively 
property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment at cost  less accumulated depreciation  and depreciate these assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
we determine this based on our estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
we evaluate these assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
any change in condition that would cause us to change our estimate of the useful lives of a group or class of assets may significantly affect depreciation expense on a prospective basis 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which range between three and nineteen years  on either a straight line basis over the expected period of benefit or as revenues are earned from the sales of the related products 
we periodically review the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and review such assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
if an intangible asset is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment will equal the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
our determination of impairment is based on estimates of future cash flows 
we will test goodwill for impairment during the third quarter of every fiscal year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment exists 
events that could  in the future  result in impairment include  but are not limited to  sharply declining sales for a significant product or in a significant geographic region 
stock based compensation on june   the effective date we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  which is a method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
in accordance with this method of adoption  prior period results of operations and financial position have not been restated to reflect the impact of stock based compensation 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for options using the intrinsic value method under the guidance of apb no 
 and provided pro forma disclosure as allowed by statement no 

table of contents for  we recognized stock based compensation expense of  before tax  net of income taxes  or per diluted share 
this stock based compensation expense included expense associated with non vested stock awards of   net of income taxes  or less than per diluted share 
under the provisions of sfas r  we will recognize the following future expense for awards granted as of june  unrecognized compensation cost weighted average remaining vesting period in years stock options non vested stock awards unrecognized compensation cost for stock options is presented net of assumed annual forfeitures 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock awards issued subsequent to the adoption of sfas r on a straight line basis over the substantive vesting period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we allocated the pro forma compensation expense for stock options over the vesting period using straight line attribution method 
we will continue to amortize compensation expense related to stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r using a straight line attribution method 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized is based on the value of the portion of awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will vest annually  and we have therefore applied a annual forfeiture rate in determining the stock based compensation charge recorded 
we will re evaluate this estimate periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate on a prospective basis as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that actually vest 
for the fiscal year ended june   we used the black scholes option pricing model black scholes as our method of valuation under sfas r and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
black scholes was also previously used for our pro forma information required by sfas for periods prior to june  the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of the grant as determined by the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as other assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  and a risk free interest rate 
the risk free interest rate is based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we consider historical volatility and trends within our industry peer group when estimating expected stock price volatility 
we use yield rates on us treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term of the award to estimate the risk free interest rate 
the expected term is based on historical exercise and forfeiture data 
the dividend yield is based on the history and expectation of dividend payments 
our historical data includes information only from may   the date of our initial public offering
