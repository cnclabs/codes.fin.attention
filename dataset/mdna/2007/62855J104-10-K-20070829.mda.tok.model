item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading biotechnology company focused on the development and marketing of novel therapeutic and molecular diagnostic products 
we employ a number of proprietary technologies that permit us to understand the genetic basis of human disease and the role that genes and their related proteins play in the onset and progression of disease 
we use this information to guide the development of new healthcare products that will treat major diseases and assess a person s risk of disease later in life 
we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our three reportable operating segments research  which focuses on the discovery of genes related to major common diseases  molecular diagnostics  which focuses on the analysis of genes and their alterations to assess the risk for developing disease later in life predictive medicine and to assess the risk of disease progression  disease recurrence  drug toxicity  and drug response personalized medicine  and drug development  which focuses on the development of therapeutic products for the treatment and prevention of major diseases 
see note segment and related information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding these operating segments 
our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of molecular diagnostic products and research payments 
we have yet to attain profitability and  for the year ended june   we had a net loss of million 
as of june  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur losses for at least the next several years  primarily due to the expansion of our drug discovery and development efforts  the initiation and continuation of clinical trials  the launch of new molecular diagnostic products  the performance of our internal research and development programs  and expansion of our facilities 
we incurred research and development expenses of million  million  and million for the years ended june    and respectively 
additionally  we expect to incur substantial sales  marketing and other expenses in connection with building our therapeutic and molecular diagnostic businesses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies which are both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and share based payment expense 
revenue recognition 
molecular diagnostic revenue includes revenue from the sale of molecular diagnostic products and related marketing agreements 
molecular diagnostic revenue is recognized upon completion of the test  communication of results  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
research revenue includes revenue from research agreements  milestone payments  and technology licensing agreements 
in applying the principles of sab and eitf to research and technology license agreements we consider the terms and conditions of each agreement separately to arrive at a proportional performance methodology of recognizing revenue 
such methodologies involve recognizing revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement  as underlying research costs are incurred  or on the basis of contractually defined output measures such as units delivered 
we make adjustments  if necessary  to the estimates used in our calculations as work progresses and we gain experience 
the principal costs under these agreements are for personnel expenses to conduct research and development but also include costs for materials and other direct and indirect items necessary to complete the research under these agreements 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
payments received on uncompleted long term contracts may be greater than or less than incurred costs and estimated earnings and have been recorded as other receivables or deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from milestone payments for which we have no continuing performance obligations is recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
when we have continuing performance obligations  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
we recognize revenue from up front nonrefundable license fees on a straight line basis over the period of our continued involvement in the research and development project 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
trade accounts receivable are comprised of amounts due from sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
we analyze trade accounts receivable and consider historic experience  customer creditworthiness  facts and circumstances specific to outstanding balances  and payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
changes in these factors could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for bad debt 
share based payment expense 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  sets accounting requirements for share based compensation to employees  including employee stock purchase plans  and requires us to recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the grant date fair value of our stock options and other equity based compensation 
the determination of grant date fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 or sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  our adoption of sfas on july  is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for income tax uncertainties 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
fin provides guidance on the de recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin on july  is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued eitf issue accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf the scope of eitf is limited to nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services related to research and development activities 
eitf addresses whether such advanced payments should be expensed as incurred or capitalized 
we are required to adopt eitf effective january  the adoption of eitf on january  is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
results of operations years ended june  and molecular diagnostic revenue is comprised primarily of sales of our molecular diagnostic products 
molecular diagnostic revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased testing volumes for the fiscal year ended june  we are currently in the process of expanding our sales force  preparing to launch a direct to consumer marketing campaign  and increasing our market penetration in the ob gyn market 
through these efforts we are attempting to broaden utilization of our products with current physician customers and increase the number of new physician customers prescribing our products 
we believe these efforts will allow us to continue to grow molecular diagnostic revenue in future periods  however  there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic revenue will continue to increase at historical rates 
research revenue is comprised of research payments received pursuant to collaborative agreements 
research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in research revenue is primarily attributable to the successful completion of a research collaboration in the prior year 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and outputs increase or decrease  revenue may increase or decrease proportionately 
in the future we expect to continue to de emphasize external collaborations and focus on internal drug development programs 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  royalty payments  equipments costs and facilities expense 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to technology improvements and efficiency gains in the operation of our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
there can be no assurance that molecular diagnostic gross profit margins will continue to increase and we expect that our gross profit margins will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on the introduction of new products as well as new technologies and operating systems in our molecular diagnostic laboratory 
research and development expenses are comprised primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  laboratory supplies  equipments costs  facilities expense  and costs associated with our clinical trials 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials of flurizan and azixa 
we expect to increase our research and development expenses over the next several years as we expand clinical trials and begin commercialization of our product candidates currently in clinical development  including flurizan and azixa  advance our other product candidates into clinical trials  and expand our research and development activities 
we expect that these expenses will continue to fluctuate based on changes in our research programs and the progression of our drug development programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related personnel costs for sales  marketing  customer service  billing and collection  executive  legal  finance and accounting  information technology  human resources  and allocated facilities expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to increased sales and marketing commissions  headcount  and related costs to support the growth in our molecular diagnostic business  which resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
marketing costs associated with the preparation of our upcoming direct to consumer advertising campaign resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
increased bad debt expense resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
increased non cash expense under sfas r associated with our stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan resulted in an increase of million compared to the prior fiscal year 
general increases in costs to support growth in our molecular diagnostic business and therapeutic development efforts resulted in an increase of approximately million to our selling  general  and administrative expense compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to fluctuate depending on the number and scope of new product launches and our drug discovery and drug development efforts 
years ended june  and molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year  an increase of 
increased sales  marketing  and education efforts resulted in wider acceptance of our products by the medical community and increased revenues for the fiscal year ended june  research revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase in research revenue is primarily attributable to revenues associated with the delivery of research data pursuant to one research collaboration 
we expect that our continued focus will be on our internal drug development and molecular diagnostic programs and we plan to continue to de emphasize external research collaborations 
research revenue from our research collaboration agreements is recognized using a proportional performance methodology 
consequently  as these programs progress and costs increase or decrease  research revenue may increase or decrease proportionately 
molecular diagnostic cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of in molecular diagnostic cost of revenue is primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic revenues for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
our gross profit margin was for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
research and development expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily due to increased costs associated with our ongoing clinical trials of flurizan  mpc  azixa  mpc  and mpc  which added approximately million to our research and development costs for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
increased costs associated with our drug discovery programs  drug development programs  and our research collaborations added approximately million to our research and development costs for the fiscal year ended june  compared to the prior fiscal year 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase of was primarily attributable to general increases in costs to support the growth in our molecular diagnostic business and our therapeutic development efforts 
other expense for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
other expense generally consists of losses realized from the disposition of equipment 
for the fiscal year ended june  other expense also included a million impairment charge related to our investment in a privately held pharmaceutical company 
the impairment charge  as determined by our cash flow estimates and an independent  third party appraisal  resulted from a change in the timing of anticipated future cash flows from the investment 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities increased million or from million at june  to million at june  this increase is primarily attributable to the public offering of million net proceeds of our common stock in february  cash generated from our molecular diagnostic revenue and  to a lesser extent  research collaboration payments and proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sales of our common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
this increase was partially offset by expenditures for our ongoing clinical trials  internal research and drug development programs  acquisition of capital assets  and other expenditures incurred in the ordinary course of business 
interest income for the fiscal year ended june  was million  compared to million for the prior fiscal year  which was due primarily to increases in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable investment securities 
net cash used in operating activities was million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in operating activities during the prior fiscal year 
trade receivables increased million between june  and june   primarily due to the increase in molecular diagnostic sales during the same period 
accounts payable increased by million between june  and june   primarily due to amounts owed related to our ongoing clinical trials 
our investing activities used cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million used in investing activities during the prior fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended june   purchases of marketable investment securities used cash of million  maturities of marketable investment securities provided cash of million  and capital expenditures for research equipment used cash of million 
financing activities provided cash of million during the fiscal year ended june  and provided cash of million in the prior fiscal year 
in february  we received million in net proceeds from an underwritten offering of million shares of our common stock pursuant to our outstanding shelf registration statement on form s registration no 

following the offering we have approximately million of securities available for sale under this shelf registration statement 
during the fiscal year ended june   we received million from the exercise of stock options and the purchase of our common stock from our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that with our existing capital resources  we will have adequate funds to maintain our current and planned operations for at least the next two years  although no assurance can be given that changes will not occur that would consume available capital resources before such time and we may need or want to raise additional financing within this period of time 
our future capital requirements  cash flows  and results of operations could be affected by and will depend on many factors that are currently unknown to us  including the progress and results of our two current phase clinical trials of flurizan for the treatment of alzheimer s disease and any additional trials that may be required by the fda or that we may initiate on our own  the progress and results of our three current phase clinical trials of azixa for the treatment of cancer and any additional trials that we may initiate based on the phase results  the progress and results of our phase clinical trials for mpc and mpc and any future trials that we may initiate based on the phase results  the results of our preclinical studies and testing for our preclinical programs and any decisions to initiate clinical trials if supported by the preclinical results  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory review of flurizan  azixa  mpc  mpc  and any other preclinical drug candidates that may progress to clinical trials  the costs of establishing sales and marketing functions and of establishing commercial manufacturing capacities if any of our drug candidates is approved  the scope  progress  results and cost of preclinical development  clinical trials and regulatory review of any new drug candidates we may discover or acquire  the progress  results and cost of developing additional molecular diagnostic products for our molecular diagnostic business  the costs  timing and results of launching new molecular diagnostic products  the costs  timing and outcome of any regulatory review of our existing or future molecular diagnostic products  the costs of preparing  filing and prosecuting patent applications  maintaining and enforcing our issued patents and defending intellectual property related claims  our ability to enter into strategic collaborations  licensing or other arrangements favorable to us  the costs to satisfy our obligations under potential future collaborations  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales or royalties  if any  from flurizan  azixa  mpc  mpc  and any other drug candidates 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations the following table represents our consolidated contractual obligations as of june  in thousands total less than one year years years more than years operating leases purchase obligations contractual services total contractual services represent financial commitments for drug development and clinical trial activities that can be terminated at our request 
the expected timing of payment for the obligations listed above is estimated based on current information 
actual payment timing and amounts may differ depending on the timing of goods or services received or other changes 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
certain factors that may affect future results of operations the securities and exchange commission encourages companies to disclose forward looking information so that investors can better understand a company s future prospects and make informed investment decisions 
this annual report on form k contains such forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of words such as may  anticipate  estimate  expects  projects  intends  plans  believes and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance  identify forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are management s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially and adversely from those described in the forward looking statements 
these risks include  but are not limited to the risk that we may be unable to further identify  develop or achieve commercial success for new products and technologies  the risk that we may be unable to discover drugs that are safer and more efficacious than our competitors  the risk that we may be unable to develop additional molecular diagnostic products that help assess which patients are subject to greater risk of developing diseases and who would therefore benefit from new preventive therapies  the possibility of delays in the research and development necessary to select drug development candidates and delays in clinical trials  the risk that clinical trials may not result in marketable products  the risk that we may be unable to successfully finance and secure regulatory approval of and market our drug candidates  the risk that clinical trials will not be completed on the timelines we have estimated  uncertainties about our ability to obtain new corporate collaborations and acquire new technologies on satisfactory terms  if at all  the development of competing products and services  the risk that we may be unable to protect our proprietary technologies  the risk of patent infringement claims  risks of new  changing and competitive technologies and regulations in the united states and internationally  and other factors discussed under the heading risk factors contained in item a of this annual report 
in light of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the results and events discussed in the forward looking statements contained in this annual report or in any document incorporated by reference might not occur 
stockholders are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our written investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of securities of various types and maturities of three years or less  with a maximum average maturity of months 
these securities are classified as available for sale 
available for sale securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
realized gains and losses on investment security transactions are reported on the specific identification method 
dividend and interest income are recognized when earned 
a decline in the market value of any available for sale security below cost that is deemed other than temporary results in a charge to earnings and establishes a new cost basis for the security 
the securities held in our investment portfolio are subject to interest rate risk 
changes in interest rates affect the fair market value of the marketable investment securities 
after a review of our marketable securities as of june   we have determined that in the event of a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates  the resulting decrease in fair market value of our marketable investment securities would be insignificant to the consolidated financial statements as a whole
