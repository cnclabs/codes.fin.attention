item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition  see information regarding forward looking statements and risk factors 
our predecessor  rotech medical corporation emerged from bankruptcy on march  and subsequently transferred substantially all of its assets to us in a restructuring transaction 
as used herein  unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires  references to we  our and us refer to the business and operations of rotech healthcare inc and its subsidiaries for all periods subsequent to march  and to the business and operations of rotech medical corporation and its subsidiaries for all periods prior to april  introduction background 
we provide home medical equipment and related products and services in the united states  with a comprehensive offering of respiratory therapy and durable home medical equipment and related services 
we provide equipment and services in states through approximately operating centers located primarily in non urban markets 
our revenues are principally derived from respiratory equipment rental and related services  which accounted for and of net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from respiratory equipment rental and related services include rental of oxygen concentrators  liquid oxygen systems  portable oxygen systems  ventilator therapy systems  nebulizer equipment and sleep disorder breathing therapy systems  and the sale of nebulizer medications 
we also generate revenues through the rental and sale of durable medical equipment  which accounted for and of net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues from rental and sale of durable medical equipment include hospital beds  wheelchairs  walkers  patient aids and ancillary supplies 
we derive our revenues principally from reimbursement by third party payors  including medicare  medicaid  the veterans administration va and private insurers 
we are focused on specific initiatives to continue the growth in patient and product counts experienced during and these initiatives include expanded sales and operational training programs  as well as new sales commission and recognition programs 
we believe these programs will better equip and motivate our sales force  and ultimately drive additional growth 
in addition  we have reorganized our billing center employees into cross functional teams  increased billing center staffing levels  and reduced our reliance on temporary labor in order to improve operating efficiencies 
we also continue to actively monitor and manage our cash position and capital expenditures on a daily basis 
strategic initiatives 
as a result of our highly leveraged position and the regulatory environment in which we operate  we are actively exploring and are engaged in discussions regarding various strategic transactions  such as an acquisition  debt exchange or equity offering or a combination of any such transactions 
at december   we had approximately million of long term debt outstanding 
one of the greatest risks relating to our high leverage is the possibility that a substantial down turn in earnings  including as a result of adverse regulatory changes  could jeopardize our ability to service our debt payment obligations as discussed below 
we continue to face the risk of future material adverse regulatory changes  similar to those experienced over the past several years 
as a result of cms final rule to implement the dra changes with regard to oxygen reimbursement as released in november  we do not expect to be materially impacted with respect to oxygen reimbursement until  when we do expect to be materially adversely impacted as a result of the dra s month rental cap on oxygen equipment 
in addition  there are other proposed reimbursement changes which could materially impact our financial position  including proposed changes outlined in cms national coverage analysis 
the risks and uncertainties related to the dra s month rental cap and the proposed changes in reimbursement outlined in cms national coverage analysis  as well as the current impact of recent reimbursement changes  are discussed in more detail under the heading business government regulation in part i  item above 
we believe that a strategic transaction may be necessary to delever our balance sheet and strengthen our operating and financial conditions 
such a transaction could also strengthen our competitive position 

table of contents upcoming interest payments 
we have interest payments of million each due on april and october  under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
management believes they have the ability to manage our cash flows in order to be able to meet our obligations as they become due during it is our current intention to make these interest payments when due and our current cash projections indicate that the cash generated from our operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to make these interest payments 
however  if our current cash projections are not realized  additional unfavorable regulatory actions are taken with respect to the reimbursement rates that apply to our business  we experience any significant changes in non cash working capital including accounts receivable  we experience material adverse changes in payment patterns from cms and its contractors or other third party payors  we experience another payment hold by cms similar to or longer than that experienced in september  or we are negatively impacted by other unforeseen factors  we may not have sufficient cash available to make these interest payments 
in addition  we may need  but be unable to obtain  access to our full credit facility the commitment to fund the last million of the revolving line of credit is subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the maximum credit amount then outstanding in connection with making such interest payments 
if we fail to make the required interest payments on our senior subordinated notes  we will be in default under the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes and  under certain circumstances  the indenture trustee or the holders of at least in principal amount of the then outstanding notes may declare all notes to be immediately due and payable 
furthermore  if the indenture trustee or our noteholders declared all of our senior subordinated notes to be due and payable immediately  it would result in a cross default under our credit agreement 
our assets and cash flow would not be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments  if accelerated  upon an event of default 
if the indebtedness were accelerated  this would raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  which would likely cause a deterioration of our relationships with our customers and suppliers and adversely affect our revenues  profit margins  profitability  operating cash flows  results of operations and financial condition 
any such actions could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation 
reimbursement by third party payors 
we derive a majority of our revenues from reimbursement by third party payors  including medicare  medicaid  the veterans administration and private insurers 
revenue derived from medicare  medicaid and other federally funded programs represented of our patient revenue for the year ended december  our business has been  and may continue to be  significantly impacted by changes mandated by medicare legislation 
the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or mma  significantly changed the medicare reimbursement methodology and conditions for coverage for a number of our products 
these changes include a freeze in reimbursement rates for home medical equipment from to  competitive bidding requirements  new clinical conditions for reimbursements  accreditation requirements and quality standards 
the impact of competitive bidding  new clinical conditions  accreditation requirements and quality standards is uncertain at this time 
the mma changes also include a reduction in reimbursement rates for oxygen equipment and certain other items of home medical equipment including wheelchairs  nebulizers  hospital beds and air mattresses as of january   based on the percentage difference between the amount of payment otherwise determined for and the median reimbursement amount under the federal employee health benefits program  or fehbp  as determined by the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services  or oig 
according to the oig s report on oxygen prices  fehbp median payments were approximately less than medicare payments for stationary home oxygen equipment and approximately less than 
table of contents medicare payments for portable home oxygen equipment 
the implementation of the new medicare payment amounts during resulted in a payment reduction of approximately for home oxygen equipment provided by us to medicare beneficiaries 
reductions in payment rates for established by cms for the non oxygen hme items subject to the fehbp provisions ranged between and 
the non oxygen hme items subject to the medicare price cuts accounted for approximately of our recorded revenues in furthermore  the reductions in the medicare fee schedules for home oxygen equipment together with the additional reimbursement reductions mandated by the mma in for other home medical equipment excluding inhalation drugs resulted in an aggregate reduction in our recorded revenues in the amount of approximately million 
mma also revised the payment methodology for certain drugs  including inhalation drugs dispensed through nebulizers 
for the year ended december   medicare reimbursed inhalation drug therapies provided by us accounted for approximately of our recorded revenues after allowing for the reduction in revenues related to the decreased reimbursement rate for compounded budesonide 
prior to mma  medicare paid for these drugs based on average wholesale price  or awp  as reported by drug manufacturers 
beginning january   medicare payments were reduced for most of our part b inhalation drugs from to of awp  a reduction of approximately basis points 
as of january   payments for drugs delivered through nebulizer equipment were based on of average sales price  or asp 
beginning in  mma required that payment amounts for most drugs be based on either asp or competitive bidding for drugs administered by physicians 
asp is defined statutorily as the volume weighted average of manufacturers average sales prices  calculated by adding the manufacturers average sales prices for the drug in the fiscal quarter to the number of units sold and then divided by the total number of units sold for all national drug codes assigned to the product 
under the asp methodology  medicare generally will pay of asp for multiple source drugs and of the lesser of asp or wholesale acquisition cost for single source drugs 
in addition  if the asp exceeds the widely available market price or the average manufacturer price by more than a threshold amount  asp is substituted with the lesser of the widely available market price or of the average manufacturer price 
this threshold amount was in  which is to be continued for asp payment rates are calculated and updated quarterly using the most recent manufacturer data available 
asp payment amounts for our products may fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and if these payment amounts are reduced in future quarters  this could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profitability and results of operations 
for example  the payment amounts for albuterol sulfate and ipratropium bromide  two prevalent inhalation drugs  have been significantly reduced under asp 
albuterol sulfate has been reduced from an average of per milligram in of awp to an average of per milligram in of asp and to an average of per milligram in of asp 
ipratropium bromide has been reduced from an average of per milligram in of awp to an average of per milligram in of asp and to an average of per milligram in of asp 
the change from of awp to of asp reduced our revenues by approximately million for the year ended december  this reduction was partially offset by shifts in patient and product mix 
effective january   cms established a new billing code and payment methodology for compounded budesonide  which includes compounded budesonide formulations that we provide to medicare beneficiaries based on a physician s prescription 
medicare reimbursement rates for compounded budesonide  beginning january   are based on pharmacy invoices submitted for individual claims 
this payment amount reflects a reimbursement rate based on the acquisition of raw materials and is far below the prior years payment amounts 
for the year ended december   the new reimbursement rates for compounded budesonide resulted in a reduction in our recorded revenues of approximately million 
in light of the reduced reimbursement rates for compounded budesonide and to resolve certain issues associated with a warning letter received from the food and drug administration fda which is discussed in more detail under the heading 
table of contents business government regulation in part i  item above  we are not accepting new prescriptions for certain compounded products including compounded formulations of budesonide and  where clinically appropriate  have instituted a process to transition patients currently on these compounded products to commercially available alternative products 
as a result of our decision to switch these patients to commercially available drug products  we have taken a one time  non cash charge of million for the three months and year ended december   to write off our pharmacy compounding equipment  capitalized costs associated with our compounding facility  and substantially all remaining balances for budesonide related accounts receivable 
the transition of these patients to commercially available alternative products is expected to have a positive impact on our revenues during when compared to  however these products have lower margins and  accordingly  this patient transition will have a material adverse effect on our profit margins  profitability  operating cash flows and results of operations when compared to the reimbursements for the compounded products under the prior billing code and payment methodology in effect prior to effective january   cms established new billing codes and payment methodologies for other compounded inhalation drugs  including albuterol and ipratropium 
the revised codes distinguish compounded from non compounded drugs  and medicare payments for compounded formulations are to be based on invoices for the compounded materials 
our compounding activities with respect to other inhalation drugs are not material  as such we do not expect that the new billing codes and payment methodologies with respect to such drugs will have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profit margins  profitability  operating cash flows or results of operations 
in addition to mma changes in payment methodology  given the overall reduction in payment for inhalation drugs dispensed through nebulizers  cms established a dispensing fee for inhalation drugs shipped to a beneficiary 
the dispensing fee was for a day period or for a day period 
effective january   the dispensing fee for inhalation drugs furnished to beneficiaries remained for the first day period in which a medicare beneficiary uses inhalation drugs and was reduced to for each subsequent day period 
the dispensing fee for a day supply of inhalation drugs was likewise reduced to these reductions in the medicare dispensing fees reduced our net revenue by approximately million for the year ended december  although cms has indicated that the dispensing fee for will continue to be paid at the rate  future dispensing fee reductions or eliminations  if they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profit margins  profitability  operating cash flows and results of operations 
while we were able  based upon the dispensing fees  to continue to offer inhalation drugs to medicare patients through  the reductions in dispensing fees for  along with the pricing changes resulting from the asp payment rates have resulted in a further material reduction in the revenues and profitability of our inhalation drug business and we cannot predict whether it will continue to be economically feasible for us to provide inhalation drugs in the future 
reductions in medicare reimbursement for oxygen  nebulizers and inhalation medications in  many of which are expected to continue to exist for a number of years  could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  profit margins  profitability  operating cash flows and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and disclosure of contingencies as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
critical accounting policies are those that require the most complex or subjective judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
thus  to the extent that actual events differ from our estimates and assumptions  there could be a material impact to our financial statements 
we believe that the critical accounting policies for our company are those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangibles 
the below listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting 
table of contents principles with limited or no need for management s judgment 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting available alternatives may or may not produce a materially different result 
for more information  see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our rental arrangements generally provide for fixed monthly payments established by fee schedules for as long as the patient is using the equipment and medical necessity continues subject to capped rentals which limit the rental payment period in some instances 
once initial delivery is made to the patient initial setup  a monthly billing is established based on the initial setup service date 
we recognize rental arrangement revenues ratably over the monthly service period and defer revenue for the portion of the monthly bill which is unearned 
no separate revenue is earned from the initial setup process 
we have no lease with the patient or third party payor 
during the rental period we are responsible for providing oxygen refills and for servicing the equipment based on manufacturers recommendations 
revenues for the sale of durable medical equipment and related supplies  including oxygen equipment  ventilators  wheelchairs  hospital beds and infusion pumps  are recognized at the time of delivery 
revenues for the sale of nebulizer medications  which are generally dispensed by our pharmacies and shipped directly to the patient s home  are recognized at the time of shipment 
revenues derived from capitation arrangements are insignificant 
net patient service revenues net patient service revenues are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
our billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts  as available  in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
net patient service revenues are recorded based upon the applicable fee schedule 
we track collections and adjustments as a percentage of related revenues 
historical collection and adjustment percentages serve as the basis for our provisions for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts 
the provision for contractual adjustments is recorded as a reduction to net patient service revenues and consists of differences between the non contracted third party payors allowable amounts and our usual and customary billing rate 
we do not have contracts or fee schedules with all third party payors 
accordingly  for non contracted payors where no fee schedule is available  we record revenue based upon our usual and customary billing rates 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the non contracted third party payors allowable amounts and our usual and customary billing rates are recorded against the allowance for contractual adjustments and are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application 
services for which payment is denied by governmental or third party payors  or otherwise deemed non billable by us 
final payment under governmental programs  and most third party contracts  is subject to administrative review and audit 
furthermore  the complexity of governmental and third party billing reimbursement arrangements  including patient qualification and medical necessity requirements  may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments may be recorded as the result of the denial of claims billed to governmental or third party payors  or as the result of our review procedures prior to submission of the claim to the governmental or third party payor 
actual adjustments that result from services for which payment is denied by governmental or third party payors  or otherwise deemed non billable by us are recorded against the allowance for contractual adjustments 
the provision for contractual adjustments reduces amounts recorded through our billing system to estimated net realizable amounts 
we record the provision for contractual adjustments based on a percentage of revenue 
table of contents using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record the provision for contractual adjustments are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  as well as actual contractual adjustment experience 
this percentage  which is adjusted at least on an annual basis  has proven to be the best indicator of expected realizable amounts 
we closely monitor our historical contractual adjustment rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms to help assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information we believe to be available 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required in order to record net patient service revenues at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements  patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
the provision for doubtful accounts is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the patient s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay  as described below 
provision for doubtful accounts medicare and most other government and commercial payors that provide coverage to our customers include a percent co payment provision in addition to a nominal deductible 
co payments are generally not collected at the time of service and are invoiced to the customer or applicable secondary payor supplemental providers of insurance coverage on a monthly billing cycle as products are provided 
a majority of our customers maintain  or are entitled to  secondary or supplemental insurance benefits providing gap coverage of this co payment amount 
in the event coverage is denied by the third party payor  the customer is ultimately responsible for payment of charges for all services rendered by us 
collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risk  with regard to doubtful accounts  relates to patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid  but patient responsibility amounts generally deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
we record a provision for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record the provision for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  actual write offs  and accounts receivable agings 
accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when all collection efforts have been exhausted 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with our historical bad debt rates and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of patient accounts when we consider the adequacy of the amounts we record as provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
accounts receivable  net accounts receivable are presented net of allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts 
allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are initially recorded based upon historical collection experience through the provisions for contractual adjustment and doubtful accounts  as described above 
if the payment amount received differs from the net realizable amount  an adjustment is made to the net realizable amount in the period that these payment differences are determined 
actual accounts receivable write offs due to contractual adjustments or accounts deemed uncollectible are applied against these allowance accounts in the normal course of business 
on a quarterly basis  we perform analyses to evaluate the estimated 
table of contents net realizable value of accounts receivable 
as a result of this quarterly review process  the allowances for contractual adjustments and doubtful accounts are adjusted  as necessary  to reflect that estimated net realizable value 
specifically  we consider historical collection data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required in order to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they may have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
it is possible that management s estimates could change  which could have an impact on operations and cash flows 
for example  a decline in the overall collection rate would reduce net patient service revenue and associated net accounts receivable by million based upon million in annual gross patient service revenue 
additionally  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements  patient qualification for medical necessity of equipment and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
reorganization value in excess of value of identifiable assets goodwill and intangible assets reorganization value in excess of value of identifiable assets goodwill  represents the portion of our reorganization value at march  that could not be attributed to specific tangible or identified intangible assets recorded in connection with the implementation of fresh start reporting 
these amounts are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
to the extent the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  we would record an impairment charge for the difference 
fair values for goodwill and intangible assets are determined based upon discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
our branch locations have similar economic characteristics and are aggregated into one reporting unit for assessing fair value 
the impairment evaluation for goodwill and other intangible assets is conducted annually  or more frequently  if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
we account for our business combinations in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
purchase prices are allocated to the various underlying tangible and intangible assets and liabilities on the basis of estimated fair value 
the fair value of acquired finite lived identifiable intangible assets is amortized over the period of their expected useful life  generally to years 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  adjusted for the impact of fresh start reporting 
patient service equipment represents medical equipment rented or held for rental to in home patients 
patient service equipment is accounted for using a composite method  due to its characteristics of high unit volumes of relative low dollar unit cost items 
under the composite method  the purchase cost of monthly purchases of certain patient service equipment are capitalized and depreciated over five years using the straight line convention  without specific physical tracking of individual items 
we believe the five year depreciation period provides a proper matching of the cost of patient service equipment with the patient service revenues generated from use of the equipment  when considering the wear and tear  damage  loss and ultimately scrapping of patient service equipment over its life 
other property and equipment is accounted for by a specific identification system 
depreciation for other property and equipment is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  seven years for furniture and office equipment  five years for vehicles  three years for computer equipment  and the shorter of the remaining lease term or the estimated useful life for leasehold improvements 
capitalized software included in property  equipment and improvements are costs related to internally developed and purchased software that are capitalized and amortized over periods from three to fifteen years 
capitalized costs include 
table of contents direct costs of materials and services incurred in developing or obtaining internal use software and payroll and payroll related costs for employees directly involved in the development of internal use software 
the carrying value of capitalized software is reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that it may be impaired 
indicators of impairment may include a subsequent change in the extent or manner in which the software is used or expected to be used  a significant change to the software is made or expected to be made or the cost to develop or modify internal use software exceeds that expected amount 
income taxes in connection with our predecessor s rotech medical corporation plan of reorganization the plan  we entered into a tax sharing agreement with our predecessor and integrated health services  inc that sets forth our rights and obligations with respect to taxes arising from and in connection with the implementation of the plan 
the tax sharing agreement provides that the parties to the agreement will  for tax purposes  treat the transfer of our predecessor s assets to us as a taxable event rather than as a tax free reorganization 
an election was made under section h of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and under analogous state and local law  with respect to the transfer of our predecessor s assets to us 
as a result of such election  we accounted for the acquisition of the stock of all of our predecessor s subsidiaries as if we had acquired the assets of those subsidiaries for income tax purposes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts expected to be realized 
net operating loss carryforwards and credits nols are subject to review and possible adjustments by the internal revenue service and may be limited by the occurrence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interests 
the effect of an ownership change would be the imposition of an annual limitation on the use of the nol carryfowards attributable to periods before the change 
we regularly monitor changes in ownership and any implications thereof under section of the internal revenue code 
contingencies our business is subject to extensive laws and government regulations  including those related to the medicare and medicaid programs 
we are also subject to a corporate integrity agreement with the dhhs 
non compliance with such laws and regulations or the corporate integrity agreement could subject us to severe sanctions  including penalties and fines 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles related to these matters 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that our accrued liabilities related to such contingencies are appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
fresh start reporting we adopted fresh start reporting upon our emergence from bankruptcy  effective as of march  under fresh start reporting  our reorganization value was allocated to our assets based on their respective fair values in conformity with a method similar in nature to the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
any portion not attributed to specific tangible or identified intangible assets are reported as an intangible asset referred to as reorganization value in excess of value of identifiable assets goodwill 
in adopting fresh start reporting  we engaged an independent financial advisor to assist in the determination of the reorganization value or fair value of the entity

the net decrease for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to i reduced medicare reimbursement rates for compounded budesonide which reduced net revenues by approximately million  ii additional provisions for accounts receivable contractual allowances recorded as a result of a deterioration in the aging of accounts receivable as described below including million recorded during the quarter ended june  and million recorded during the quarter ended december  as the result of an increased monthly provision rate for accounts receivable contractual allowances  iii reduction in the dispensing fee for nebulizer medications which reduced net revenues by approximately million  and iv volume reductions under our contract with gentiva health services gentiva which reduced net revenue by approximately million as a result of an amendment to their contract with cigna healthcare cigna  whereby gentiva would no longer coordinate specific respiratory therapy and dme services on behalf of cigna effective january  these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in net revenue for the year ended december  from locations acquired during and and million in net revenue for the year ended december  from a increase in oxygen and drug patient counts excluding acquisitions and a increase in other dme respiratory product counts excluding acquisitions 
the million in additional provision for accounts receivable contractual allowances which was recorded as a reduction to net revenue for the year ended december   was attributable to a shift in the 
table of contents composition of our accounts receivable  whereby a higher percentage of receivables are remaining outstanding for longer periods 
this increase in the aging of accounts receivable is due to numerous factors  including increased transaction volumes from patient growth  general slowdowns in payment processing by medicare and other third party payors  delays caused by medicare beneficiaries switching to hmos  and billing disruptions related to the transition to electronic billing for certain third party payors 
the increased provision for accounts receivable contractual allowances was calculated primarily using a historical collections model 
shifts in the aging of accounts receivable  when compared to historical aging levels  resulted in the need for additional accounts receivable allowances  reflecting an inherent reduction in collectibility as accounts receivable age 
we continue to pursue collection of accounts receivable in the normal course of business and this increased allowance does not reflect a write off of specific accounts receivable 
we have reorganized our billing center operations and increased staffing to address those factors above that are under our control 
we have also appointed a vice president of billing and collections to implement these initiatives 
while these initiatives are designed to improve the collection process  there can be no assurance that such initiatives will result in improved collections 
we also increased our monthly provision rate effective in the fourth quarter of to provide a higher level of contractual allowances 
cost of net revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the comparable period in the net increase was primarily attributable to an million increase in product and supply cost resulting from an increase in the number of patients served  changes in our product mix and an increase in drug costs 
operating costs increased million as the result of an increase in the number of respiratory therapists employed 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in patient service equipment depreciation as a result of decreased capital expenditures and a significant portion of our oxygen rental equipment becoming fully depreciated 
cost of net revenues as a percentage of net revenue was for the year ended december  as compared to for the comparable period in the provision for doubtful accounts for the year ended december  decreased by million  or  to million  from the comparable period in the provision for doubtful accounts expense as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  as compared to for this decrease was mainly attributable to a shift in the overall allowance accrual rate  reducing the monthly provision for bad debt expense and increasing the monthly provision for contractual adjustments recorded as a reduction of net revenues 
the shift in the accrual rate is based on historical adjustment experience 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  totaled million  an increase of million or from the comparable period in the increase primarily resulted from i million of costs related to discussions regarding a potential strategic transaction which have terminated and were therefore expensed  ii a million increase in automobile expenses  iii a million increase in salaries related to locations acquired during and  and iv a million increase in insurance costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase as a percentage of net revenues is attributable to the decline in net revenue for the year ended december  and the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses described above 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  totaled million  a decrease of million from the comparable period in due to an overall decline in our profitability which resulted primarily from decreases in medicare reimbursement rates  including reductions for compounded budesonide  and the resulting decline in our market capitalization  we recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of million during the year ended december  other than approximately million paid in september in connection with the fifth amendment and limited waiver to our former credit agreement  these impairment charges did not result in cash expenditures and will not result in future cash expenditures 

table of contents net interest expense for the year ended december  increased million from the comparable period in the increase is primarily attributable to increased borrowing under our former senior credit facility and a basis point increase in the libor rate 
we recorded a million benefit for federal and state income taxes for the year ended december  for current period losses that offset deferred tax liabilities previously recorded 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our remaining net deferred tax assets  as it appears more likely than not that such assets will not be realized through offset of future taxable income 
net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  as outlined above  million of the current year net loss is attributable to non cash goodwill impairment charges  million to medicare reimbursement cuts and million to additional provisions for accounts receivable contractual allowances 
the internal growth described above has not been sufficient to offset the impact of these items 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total net revenues for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million  from the comparable period in the net decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in reimbursement rates for medicare part b drugs in the amount of million  reductions in reimbursement for hme equipment subject to fehbp provisions and a reduction in oxygen and other equipment reimbursements in the aggregate amount of million  offset by a increase in oxygen and drug patient counts including an increase in net revenues of related to business acquisitions and increased dme sales and other respiratory equipment sales 
cost of net revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the comparable period in the net increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in product and supply cost resulting from an increase in the number of patients served  changes in our product mix and an increase in drug costs

selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased by million  or  to million  from the comparable period in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the increase resulted primarily from both costs associated with the rollout of our announced growth strategy and the expenses related to establishing new locations and operating newly acquired businesses which costs and expenses represent of net revenues 
the residual increase is mainly attributable to general cost inflation 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  from the comparable period in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in capital purchases of non patient service equipment  computer software and computer software upgrades 

table of contents net interest expense for the year ended december  decreased million from the comparable period in the decrease is primarily attributable to the repayment of approximately million of long term bank debt principal during the first quarter of  as well as the repurchase  in august  of million of our senior subordinated notes due federal and state income taxes for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the comparable period of the decrease in federal and state income taxes was primarily due to decreased taxable income for the year ended december  net earnings for the year ended december  was million compared to net earnings of million for the year ended december  as outlined above  internal growth was not sufficient to offset approximately million in medicare reimbursement cuts 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

this increase in dso is indicative of increased transaction volumes  as well as previously disclosed slow downs in the collection of accounts receivable 
the following table sets forth the percentage breakdown of our accounts receivable by payor and aging category as of december  and december  accounts receivable by payor and aging category government managed care and other patient responsibility total aged days aged days aged days aged over days total december  accounts receivable by payor and aging category government managed care and other patient responsibility total aged days aged days aged days aged over days total 
table of contents included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts include million at december  and million at december  of receivables for which a prior authorization is required but has not yet been received 
delays  ranging from a day to several weeks  between the date of service and billing can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources 
earned but unbilled receivables are aged from the date of service and are considered in our analysis of historical performance and collectibility 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
management performs analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  management considers historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that management s estimates could change  which could have an impact on operations and cash flows 
for example  for the year ended december   we had million of changes in estimates increasing contractual adjustments and the provision for doubtful accounts related to the prior period recorded during the current period 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs and from managed care health plans 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs may be less than billed charges 
revenue is recognized at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
our billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of the equipment or supply provided to a customer 
for medicare and medicaid revenues  as well as most other managed care and private payors  final payment is subject to administrative review and audit 
management makes estimated provisions for adjustments  which may result from administrative review and audit  based upon historical experience 
management closely monitors its historical collection rates as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms to help assure that provisions are made using the most accurate information management believes to be available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments we receive could be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
collection of receivables from third party payors and patients is our primary source of cash and is critical to our operating performance 
our primary collection risks relate to patient accounts for which the primary insurance payor has paid  but patient responsibility amounts generally deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
accounts are written off against the allowance when all collection efforts including payor appeals processes have been exhausted 
we routinely review accounts receivable balances in conjunction with our historical contractual adjustment and bad debt rates and other economic conditions which might ultimately affect the collectibility of patient accounts when we consider the adequacy of the amounts we record as provision for doubtful accounts 
significant changes in payor mix  business office operations  economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could affect our collection of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 
we manage billing and collection of accounts receivable through our own billing and collection centers 
further  even if our billing procedures comply with all third party payor requirements  some of our payors may experience financial difficulties  may delay payments or may otherwise not pay accounts receivable when due  which would result in increased write offs or provisions for doubtful accounts 
for example  cms placed a hold on payments for all claims under medicare parts a and b from all 
table of contents providers and all physicians during the last nine days of the federal fiscal year september september  
information is not available to determine the exact impact of this payment hold  however  we have estimated the impact to be between approximately million and million  which resulted in a corresponding increase in accounts receivable and decrease in cash at september  we received payment for claims impacted by the payment hold during the first two weeks of october in addition  we also continue to experience inconsistent payment patterns from cms and its contractors and other third party payors 
as such  we may not be able to maintain our current levels of collectibility 
in addition  third party payors may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to make timely payments to us 
if we are unable to collect our accounts receivable on a timely basis  our revenues  profitability and cash flow likely will significantly decline 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that management s estimates could change  which could have an impact on operations and cash flows 
our future liquidity may be materially adversely impacted by the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of see risk factors above 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we currently have no contractual commitments for capital expenditures over the next twelve months other than to acquire equipment as needed to supply our patients 
our business requires us to make significant capital expenditures relating to the purchase and maintenance of the medical equipment used in our business 
the decrease in net cash used in investing activities during is attributed to i increased utilization of existing equipment  which decreased our capital expenditures from million of our net revenues to million of our net revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and ii discontinuance of business acquisitions  which decreased cash outlays for businesses acquired from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows used in financing activities primarily relate to repayment of debt facilities entered into on the effective date of our predecessor s plan of reorganization on march  as of december   we had the following credit facilities and outstanding debt two year million senior secured revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes including working capital  capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions 
as of december   we did not have any amounts outstanding under this revolving credit facility  however  we had million committed under standby letters of credit

the term loan is repayable  quarterly  in an aggregate annual amount equal to of the principal amount commencing on december   with the remaining balance due in september advances outstanding on the term loan bear interest at the rate of libor plus 
as of december   we had a balance of million outstanding under our former term loan and accrued interest on borrowings under our former term loan of million

a portion of the revolving line of credit  not in excess of million is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
borrowings under the senior secured revolving line of credit and term loan are secured by substantially all of our assets and the agreements with respect to such revolving credit facility and term loan impose numerous restrictions  including  but not limited to  covenants with respect to certain specified ebitda thresholds and a specified consolidated total leverage ratio requirement  limitations on additional borrowing  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments 
our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis  continued funding of our revolving line of credit and ultimately to achieve successful operations 
our working capital requirements relate primarily to the working capital needed for general corporate purposes 
our business requires us to make significant capital expenditures relating to the purchase and maintenance of the medical equipment used in our business 
we do not expect to exceed our debt limitations for capital expenditures during the year ended december  prior to  we have historically satisfied our working capital requirements and capital expenditures from operating cash flow 
our current cash projections indicate that the cash generated from our operations and the funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient and we expect to be able to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs through management believes they have the ability to manage our cash flows in order to be able to meet our obligations as they become due during however  if our current cash projections are not realized  additional unfavorable regulatory actions are taken with respect to the reimbursement rates that apply to our business  we experience any significant changes in non cash working capital including accounts receivable  we experience material adverse changes in payment patterns from cms and its contractors or other third party payors  we experience another payment hold by cms similar to or longer than that experienced in september  or we are negatively impacted by other unforeseen factors  we may not have sufficient cash available to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and other cash needs through in addition  we may need  but be unable to obtain  access to our full credit facility the commitment to fund the last million of the revolving line of credit is subject to the approval of lenders holding a majority of the maximum credit amount then outstanding in connection with meeting our cash needs

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
prior practice allowed the evaluation of materiality on the basis of the error quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement was misstated rollover method or the cumulative error quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet was misstated iron curtain method 
the guidance provided in sab requires both methods to be used in evaluating materiality 
if applying the provisions of sab results in errors that are deemed material  than such errors  along with any additional immaterial errors  would be corrected through a cumulative effect adjustment 
the cumulative effect of the correction would be reflected in the opening balance sheet with appropriate disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error corrected in the cumulative adjustment  as well as a disclosure of the cause of the error and whether the error had been deemed to be immaterial in the past 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   with earlier adoption encouraged 
we adopted sab as of december  and such adoption had no financial impact on our results of operation or financial condition 
inflation and seasonality management believes that there has been no material effect on our operations or financial condition as a result of inflation during the past three fiscal years 
however  we are impacted by rising costs for certain inflation sensitive operating expenses  such as labor and employee benefits  facility and equipment leases  and vehicle fuel 
with reductions in reimbursement by government and private medical insurance programs and pressure to contain the costs of such programs  we bear the risk that reimbursement rates set by such programs will not keep pace with inflation 
management also believes that the seasonal impact on our business is not material
