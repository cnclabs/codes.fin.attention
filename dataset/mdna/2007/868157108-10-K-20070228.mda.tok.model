executive summary we are a leading  highly diversified provider of oilfield services and equipment 
we focus on serving the drilling related needs of oil and gas companies primarily through our rental tools segment  and the production related needs of oil and gas companies through our well intervention  rental tools and marine segments 
we have expanded geographically so that we now have a growing presence in select domestic land and international market areas 
we also own and operate  through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  mature oil and gas properties in the gulf of mexico 
the oil and gas industry remains highly cyclical and seasonal 
activity levels in our service and rental tools segments are driven primarily by traditional energy industry activity indicators  which include current and expected commodity prices  drilling rig counts  oil and gas production levels  and customers spending allocated for drilling and production 
several factors contributed to our financial performance in  including increased customer spending levels on finding oil and gas reserves due to high commodity prices  increased customer focus on replacing reserves and increasing production through production enhancement projects in existing wells  growth in our non gulf of mexico market areas  and extremely high demand in the gulf of mexico market area 
the and hurricane seasons were a significant catalyst for gulf of mexico activity in first  repair work to damaged platforms and wells created demand for our liftboats  well control  plug and abandonment  project management and engineering services 
second  storm related disruptions and the associated repair work delayed typical production enhancement projects  creating pent up demand for our production related services and liftboats 
we experienced additional service work as these production related projects started to get addressed during the year 
finally  insurance costs for oil and gas operators in the gulf of mexico have increased dramatically 
as a result  many customers emphasized plugging and abandoning uneconomic wells in an effort to lower their insurance costs 
this also drove demand for plug and abandonment services  liftboats and ancillary equipment in revenue from our non gulf of mexico market areas was approximately million  a increase from more than of this non gulf of mexico revenue  or about million  was generated from domestic land market areas 
we continued to aggressively expand our rentals of accommodation units and accessories  drill collars  drill pipe  ancillary tubulars  handling tools and stabilizers into arkansas  oklahoma  texas and the rocky mountains market areas 
we also expanded our well intervention services to some of these same market areas and experienced activity increases in our existing onshore locations for coiled tubing  mechanical wireline and electric line services 
in  we continued our domestic land and international expansion strategy 
we aggressively expanded our rental tools internationally in certain international market areas  including the north sea  west africa and the middle east 
in july  we announced the signing of more than million of international contracts 
in december  we completed our acquisition of warrior energy services corporation  which is a provider of production related services primarily in the major domestic land basins 
well intervention segment 
table of contents the well intervention segment consists of specialized down hole services  which are both labor and equipment intensive 
while our gross margin percentage tends to be fairly consistent  projects such as emergency well control work can directly increase the gross margin percentage 
revenue and income from operations were and higher  respectively  as compared to this was due mainly to a sharp rebound in gulf of mexico activity following significant downtime in due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
in the gulf of mexico  well control  engineering and plug and abandonment services were utilized in hurricane recovery projects 
in addition  activity in the gulf of mexico for our production related services such as coiled tubing  electric line  hydraulic workover  mechanical wireline and pumping and stimulation also experienced significant increases due to an increase in production related projects 
we also grew our non gulf of mexico activity as reflected by a increase in this segment s non gulf of mexico revenue 
these increases were primarily a result of continued domestic land expansion of our production related services 
rental tools segment the rental tools segment consists of tools and equipment used in oil and gas drilling and production 
this segment is capital and equipment intensive 
it is characterized by high gross and operating margins due in part to relatively low operating costs 
the largest fixed cost is typically depreciation as there is little labor associated with our rental tools businesses 
historically  pricing has not significantly fluctuated and financial performance is more of a function of changes in volume rather than pricing 
revenue increased and income from operations increased over although pricing tends to be stable  we were able to raise prices for many of our rental tools as a result of robust demand in many of our market areas 
the largest activity increases were in the gulf of mexico  followed by the domestic land markets areas 
rentals outside the gulf of mexico represent more than of this segment s total revenue in marine segment the marine segment consists of our rental liftboats 
the operating costs of our liftboats are relatively fixed and  therefore  gross margin percentages vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year primarily based on changes in dayrates and utilization levels 
as an indication of this segment s performance  gross margin percentages were for primarily due to dayrates that were at their highest levels in our history and high utilization 
revenue increased and income from operations increased over dayrates increased throughout the year as a result of multiple rate increases as our liftboats were used to support hurricane related projects and to support the increase in traditional production related activity 
as the year progressed  the mix of work for our liftboats shifted away from supporting construction work associated with hurricane recovery projects as demand for production related projects increased 
oil and gas segment through our subsidiary spn resources  llc  we acquire  manage and decommission mature properties in the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
as of december   we had interests in offshore blocks containing structures and approximately producing wells 
the main objective of this business segment is to provide additional opportunities for our products and services  especially during cyclical and seasonal slower periods 
because of the relatively high fixed costs of our well intervention services  the incremental cost to work on mature properties is far less than it would be for traditional energy producers 
this segment provides work for our services  thereby increasing utilization of our own assets by deploying services on our own properties during periods of downtime 
the lease operating expenses for mature properties are typically relatively high because of the amount of well intervention service work required to enhance  maintain and extend their productive lives 
revenues were higher and income from operations was higher than we spent the first several months of the year working to restore production and repair damages caused by the active hurricane season of 
table of contents production was fully restored by april 
we also added production through our second quarter acquisition of five offshore gulf of mexico leases 
we had approximately  boe of production in as compared to approximately  boe of production in critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to long lived assets and goodwill  income taxes  allowance for doubtful accounts  self insurance and oil and gas properties 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets  including oil and gas properties  used in operations when the estimated cash flows to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization levels  operating performance  and with respect to our oil and gas properties  future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of this future production  future costs to produce the oil and natural gas and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the sum of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the net carrying value of assets not fully recoverable is reduced to fair value 
our estimate of fair value represents our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market transactions and is subject to variability 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fas no 
requires that goodwill as well as other intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested annually for impairment 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on our fair value and carrying value at december we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units which are consistent with our reportable segments using various cash flow and earnings projections 
we then compare these fair value estimates to the carrying value of our reporting units 
if the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment loss is recognized 
our estimates of the fair value of these reporting units represent our best estimates based on industry trends and reference to market transactions 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between 
table of contents financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer s payment history and information regarding customer s creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against which we do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when services or equipment are provided and collectibility is reasonably assured 
services and rentals are generally provided based on fixed or determinable priced purchase orders or contracts with customers 
we contract for marine  well intervention and environmental projects either on a day rate or turnkey basis  with a majority of our projects conducted on a day rate basis 
our rental tools are rented on a day rate basis  and revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized when the equipment is shipped 
we are using the percentage of completion method for recognizing our revenues and related costs on our contract to construct a derrick barge for a third party 
we are estimating the percentage complete utilizing engineering estimates and construction progress 
we recognize oil and gas revenue from our interests in producing wells as the commodities are delivered  and the revenue is recorded net of royalties and hedge payments due or inclusive of hedge payments receivable 
self insurance 
we self insure  through deductibles and retentions  up to certain levels for losses related to workers compensation  marine protection and indemnity  general liability  property damage  and group medical 
with the recent contractions of insurance availability  we have been forced to retain more risk by increasing our self insurance 
we accrue for these liabilities based on estimates of the ultimate cost of claims incurred as of the balance sheet date 
we regularly review our estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses through reserves 
we also have an actuary review our estimates for losses related to workers compensation and group medical on an annual basis 
while we believe these estimates are reasonable based on the information available  our financial results could be impacted if litigation trends  claims settlement patterns and future inflation rates are different from our estimates 
although we believe adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  and we believe that we maintain adequate insurance coverage  we cannot assure that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
oil and gas properties 
our subsidiary  spn resources  llc  acquires mature oil and gas properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our investment in oil and natural gas properties 
under the successful efforts method  the costs of successful exploratory wells and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized 
costs incurred to drill and equip developmental wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized 
other costs such as geological and geophysical costs and the drilling costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed 
spn resources property purchases are recorded at the value exchanged at closing  combined with an estimate of its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability assumed in the purchase 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field and allocated to leasehold costs and well costs 
leasehold costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
well costs are depleted on a units of production basis based on the estimated remaining equivalent proved developed oil and gas reserves of each field 
we estimate the third party market price to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and use that estimate to record our proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  we will utilize the services of our subsidiaries to 
table of contents perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by our subsidiaries  all recorded intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than our incurred costs  the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value on a field by field basis whenever indicators become evident 
we use our current estimate of future revenues and operating expenses to test the capitalized costs for impairment 
in the event net undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded based on the present value of expected future net cash flows over the economic lives of the reserves 
proved reserve estimates 
our reserve information is prepared by independent reserve engineers in accordance with guidelines established by the securities and exchange commission 
there are a number of uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control such as commodity pricing 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of crude oil and natural gas that can not be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s guidelines  we use prices and costs determined on the date of the actual estimate and a discount rate to determine the present value of future net cash flow 
actual prices and costs may vary significantly  and the discount rate may or may not be appropriate based on outside economic conditions 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were  million  resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
our net income includes a loss on early extinguishment of debt of million 
for the year ended december   revenues were million  and net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
we experienced significantly higher revenues and gross margins for our well intervention  rental tools and marine segments due to higher pricing and utilization for most products and services offered 
factors driving our improved performance include higher commodity prices resulting in additional production and drilling related activity worldwide  as well as demand for our services and liftboats that are necessary to assist in repair work needed as the result of the active gulf of mexico hurricane seasons of and the following table compares our operating results for the years ended december  and gross margin is calculated by subtracting cost of services from revenue for each of our four business segments

total the following discussion analyzes our results on a segment basis 

table of contents well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced higher revenue for most of our production related services as pricing and utilization were higher due to increased demand for production related services and hurricane related repair work in the gulf of mexico 
in addition  revenue increased for our plug and abandonment services as many customers continue to plug severely damaged wells and temporarily or permanently plug other wells to lower their insurance exposure and risk of damage from any future hurricanes 
we also increased our revenues in the domestic onshore markets and acquired warrior energy services corporation in december to further this expansion and strengthen this segment 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for was million  a increase over the gross margin percentage increased to in from in we experienced significant increases in revenue from our stabilizers  on site accommodations  drill pipe and accessories  specialty tubulars and drill collars 
the increases are primarily the result of significant increases in activity in the gulf of mexico  domestic land markets  as well as our international expansion efforts 
our international revenue for the rental tools segment has increased to approximately million for over marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  increased over to million 
the gross margin percentage for increased to from in the year ended december  was characterized by a significant increase in liftboat pricing and utilization due to increased demand resulting from increases in gulf of mexico production related activity and ongoing construction and repair work as a result of the damage in the gulf of mexico from hurricanes katrina and rita 
the fleet s average dayrate increased over to approximately  in from  in the fleet s average utilization increased to approximately in from in the year ended december  also included five months of rental activity from the foot and the to foot class liftboats  which were sold june  oil and gas segment oil and gas revenues were million in the year ended december   as compared to million in in  production was approximately  boe  as compared to approximately  boe in the gross margin percentage increased to in from in due to increased production and commodity prices  despite increased insurance cost and repair costs related to hurricanes katrina and rita 
the oil and gas segment also benefited from the additional production as a result of the acquisition of the offshore gulf of mexico leases in april depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase results from the depreciation associated with our and capital expenditures primarily in the rental tools segment  as well as additional depletion associated with increased oil and gas production 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased expense related to our continued growth through expanding our geographic area of operations and acquisitions as well as increased incentive compensation expense due to our strong operating results 
general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenue for from in 
table of contents comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and for the year ended december   our revenues were million resulting in net income of million or diluted earnings per share 
for the year ended december   revenues were million and net income was million or diluted earnings per share 
we experienced higher revenue and gross margin in all our segments  especially our rental tools  oil and gas and well intervention segments as activity levels increased 
however  the extraordinarily active hurricane season disrupted most of our activity for several months following hurricanes katrina and rita 
the following table compares our operating results for the years ended december  and gross margin is calculated by subtracting cost of services from revenue for each of our four business segments

total the following discussion analyzes our operating results on a segment basis 
well intervention segment revenue for our well intervention segment was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for this segment s gross margin percentage increased slightly to in from in we experienced higher revenue for almost all of our services as production related activity improved in the gulf of mexico  particularly for the well control  hydraulic workover  coiled tubing  wireline and field management services 
activity levels declined in the months following hurricanes katrina and rita  but pre storm demand levels returned near the end of the year 
rental tools segment revenue for our rental tools segment for the year ended december  was million  a increase over the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and we experienced significant increases in revenue from our on site accommodations  drill pipe and accessories and stabilizers 
the increases are primarily the result of significant increases in activity in the gulf of mexico  as well as our international and domestic expansion efforts 
although our rental tools segment was negatively impacted from hurricanes katrina and rita in august and september of  activity levels surpassed pre storm levels for most of our rental tools by the end of the year 
our international revenue for the rental tools segment has increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from our biggest improvements were in the north sea  trinidad  venezuela and mexico 
marine segment our marine segment revenue for the year ended december  increased over to million 
the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  increased to from for the year ended december  includes only five months of rental activity from the foot and the to foot class liftboats 
these rental liftboats were sold effective june  the increase in revenue is caused by increased utilization of our fleet s remaining larger liftboats at higher dayrates partially offset by fewer liftboats generating revenue for seven months of the increase in the gross margin percentage is also caused by 
table of contents increased demand and the sale of our lower margin rental liftboats 
the fleet s average dayrate increased to approximately  in the year ended december  from approximately  in increased demand as well as the sale of the smaller liftboats also contributed to the increase in average dayrates 
the fleet s average utilization increased to approximately for the year ended december  from in our liftboat fleet experienced strong increases in demand and pricing in the fourth quarter as liftboats were needed for the large amount of construction and repair work in the gulf of mexico as a result of hurricane damage 
oil and gas segment oil and gas revenues were million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the increase in revenue is primarily the result of production from south pass  which was acquired in july  and production from west delta  which was acquired in december we also acquired galveston and high island a in late july in the year ended december   production was approximately  boe as compared to approximately  boe in the gross margin percentage remained unchanged at for the years ended december  and the oil and gas segment was affected by significant amounts of curtailed production resulting from the active hurricane seasons the past two years resulting in deferred production as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in of approximately  boe and as a result of hurricane ivan in of approximately  boe 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the increase is primarily a result of depletion and accretion related to our oil and gas properties from both increased production and acquisitions of oil and gas properties 
the increase also results from the depreciation associated with our and capital expenditures primarily in the rental tools segment 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million in of this increase  million is the result of storm related costs from hurricanes katrina and rita in the third and fourth quarters of including million in equipment and facility losses and repairs  million in relief aid to more than employees affected by the hurricanes and million in storm related payroll expenses  temporary lodging and miscellaneous expenses 
the remaining increase was primarily related to increased payroll and bonus expenses  increased insurance costs and expenses as a result of our growth  oil and gas acquisitions and geographic expansion 
reduction in value of assets during the year ended december   we reduced the value of two of our mature oil and gas properties by approximately million  thereby removing the reserve balance associated with these wells 
the wells were deemed to be uneconomical to further produce as a result of the estimated costs associated with maintaining production 
our oil spill containment boom manufacturing facility suffered damage from hurricane katrina and experienced difficulty in resuming normal business operations 
as a result  we elected not to reopen this manufacturing facility and sell the remaining oil spill containment boom inventory 
we reduced the value of the assets of this business which consist primarily of inventory and property and equipment by approximately million to the estimated net realizable value 
in the first quarter of  we sold our environmental subsidiary for approximately million in cash 
we reduced the net asset value of this subsidiary by million in to its approximate sales price 
gain on sale of liftboats effective june   we sold all of our rental liftboats with leg lengths from feet to feet for million in cash exclusive of costs to sell  which resulted in a gain of million 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in the year ended december   we generated net cash from operating activities of million as compared to million in our primary liquidity needs are for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we also issued million of senior notes and million of senior exchangeable notes to satisfy our liquidity needs in we had cash and cash equivalents of million at december  compared to million at december  we made approximately million of capital expenditures during the year ended december   of which approximately million was used to expand and maintain our rental tool equipment inventory 
we also made million of capital expenditures in our oil and gas segment and million of capital expenditures to expand and maintain the asset base of our well intervention and marine segments  including million related to anchor handling tugs  million related to the completion of our first derrick barge and million of progress payments related to the construction of another derrick barge 
in addition  we made million of capital expenditures on construction and improvements to our facilities 
on december   we acquired warrior energy services corporation for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the total consideration was comprised of cash payments of million including acquisition costs and repayment of debt and equity consideration of million  shares of superior common stock valued at per share  the average closing market price per share for the five trading day period beginning two trading days before the merger announcement date of september

we acquired a interest in coldren resources which acquired substantially all of noble s shallow water gulf of mexico oil and gas properties in july we have made a total cash investment in coldren resources of approximately million as of december  we do not anticipate additional cash investments in coldren resources 
during the year ended december   we paid million to acquire producing oil and gas properties located on five offshore gulf of mexico leases and purchased two businesses for approximately million 
we also sold our environmental cleaning subsidiary for approximately million during the first quarter of in july  we took delivery of an ton derrick barge 
the final payment of million was made upon its delivery and acceptance 
the derrick barge and related anchor handling tug are chartered to a third party until october  in july  we contracted to construct a derrick barge that will be sold to a third party for approximately million 
we expect to take delivery of the derrick barge and sell it to the third party during the first quarter of we receive monthly payments from the purchaser in accordance with the terms of the sales contract 
in turn  we issue letters of credit to the purchaser in equal amounts to guarantee our performance of the contract 
we have entered into fixed price contracts to construct this second derrick barge and its ton offshore mast crane 
our payment obligation for the construction of the barge is secured by letters of credit that are posted upon performance milestones and are payable upon the barge s delivery and our acceptance 
the contract for the crane requires periodic progress payments with final payment due upon completion of the contract 
revenue and costs associated with the sale contract are accounted for on the percentage of completion method utilizing engineering estimates and construction progress 
this methodology requires us to make estimates regarding our progress against the project schedule and estimated completion date  both of which impact the amount of revenue and gross margin we recognize in each reporting period 
contract costs mainly include sub contract and program management costs 
provisions for any anticipated losses will be recorded in full when such losses become evident 
in july  we contracted to construct a third derrick barge to support our decommissioning and construction operations 
we expect to take delivery of this barge in the second quarter of we have entered into fixed price

the contract for the crane requires periodic progress payments with final payment due upon completion of the contract 
we currently intend to utilize this construction barge to support our removal projects in the gulf of mexico market area for both third party customers and our subsidiary  spn resources 
we amended our revolving credit facility in the fourth quarter of increasing it to million from million 
any amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due on june  at february   we had million outstanding under the bank credit facility at an interest rate of per annum 
we also had approximately million of letters of credit outstanding  which reduces our borrowing capacity under this credit facility 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a libor rate plus margins that depend on our leverage ratio 
indebtedness under the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets  including the pledge of the stock of our principal subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary events of default and requires that we satisfy various financial covenants 
it also limits our ability to pay dividends or make other distributions  make acquisitions  create liens  incur additional indebtedness or assume additional decommissioning liabilities 
we have million outstanding at december  in u 
s 
government guaranteed long term financing under title xi of the merchant marine act of  which is administered by the maritime administration marad  for two foot class liftboats 
this debt bears an interest rate of per annum and is payable in equal semi annual installments of  on every june rd and december rd through june  our obligations are secured by mortgages on the two liftboats 
this marad financing also requires that we comply with certain covenants and restrictions  including the maintenance of minimum net worth and debt to equity requirements 
in the second quarter of  we completed a tender offer for approximately of our million outstanding of unsecured senior notes due the cash consideration for the tender offer was  per  in aggregate principal amount of senior notes tendered 
in conjunction with the tender offer  we also received consents to amend the indenture pursuant to which the senior notes were issued to eliminate from the indenture substantially all of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default 
after the tender offer was completed  we redeemed the remaining outstanding senior notes in accordance with the indenture at the redemption price of  per  of the principal amount redeemed 
we recognized a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million  which included the tender premiums  redemption premiums  fees and expenses and the write off of the remaining unamortized debt acquisition costs associated with these notes 
we issued million of unsecured senior notes due we used the net proceeds to refinance the senior notes due and related tender and redemption premiums  fees and related expenses  and to fund the equity investment in coldren resources 
the indenture governing the notes requires semi annual interest payments  on every june st and december st through the maturity date of june  the indenture contains certain covenants that  among other things  restrict us from incurring  additional debt  repurchasing capital stock  paying dividends or making other distributions  incurring liens  selling assets or entering into certain mergers or acquisitions 
in december  we issued million of senior exchangeable notes due the notes bear interest at a rate of per annum and decrease to per annum on december  interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on december th and june th of each year  beginning june  the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
under certain circumstances  holders may exchange the notes for shares of our common stock 
the initial exchange rate is shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
this is equal to an initial exchange price of per share 
the exchange price represents a premium over the closing share price at the date of issuance 
the notes may be exchanged under the following circumstances during any fiscal quarter and only during such fiscal quarter commencing after march   if the last reported sale price of our common stock is greater than or equal to of the applicable exchange price 
table of contents of the notes for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter  prior to december   during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the trading price of  principal amount of notes for each trading day in the measurement period was less than of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the exchange rate on such trading day  if the notes have been called for redemption  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  or at any time beginning on september   and ending at the close of business on the second business day immediately preceding the maturity date 
in connection with the exchangeable note transaction  we simultaneously entered into agreements with affiliates of the initial purchasers to purchase call options and sell warrants on our common stock 
we may exercise the call options we purchased at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise the warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in shares or in a combination of cash and shares  at our option 
these transactions may potentially reduce the dilution of our common stock from the exchange of the notes by increasing the effective exchange price to per share

in december  concurrently with the closing of our senior exchangeable notes  we repurchased  shares of our outstanding common stock at a price of per share  or approximately million in the aggregate  in privately negotiated block trades through one of the initial purchasers of the notes 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at december  amounts in thousands for our long term debt including estimated interest payments  decommissioning liabilities  operating leases and contractual obligations 
the decommissioning liability amounts do not give any effect to our contractual right to receive amounts from third parties  which is approximately million  when decommissioning operations are performed 
the derrick barge and tug construction obligation amounts do not give any effect to our contractual right to receive payments from a third party customer  which is approximately million 
we do not have any other material obligations or commitments 
description thereafter long term debt  including estimated interest payments decommissioning liabilities operating leases derrick barge and tug construction total we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than our potential additional consideration that may be payable as a result of the future operating performances of our acquisitions 
at december   the maximum additional consideration payable for our prior acquisitions was approximately million 
these amounts are not classified as liabilities under generally accepted accounting principles and are not reflected in our financial statements until the amounts are fixed and determinable 
when amounts are determined  they are capitalized as part of the purchase price of the related acquisition 
we do not have any other financing arrangements that are not required under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in our financial statements

we intend to continue implementing our growth strategy of increasing our scope of services through both internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect to continue to make the capital expenditures required to implement our growth strategy in amounts consistent with the amount of cash generated from operating activities  the availability of additional financing and our credit facility 
depending on the size of any future acquisitions  we may require additional equity or debt financing in excess of our current working capital and amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
hedging activities we entered into hedging transactions in that expired on august  to secure a commodity price for a portion of our oil production and to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
we used financially settled crude oil swaps and zero cost collars that provided floor and ceiling prices with varying upside price participation 
our swaps and zero cost collars were designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
we have not hedged any of our natural gas production 
we recognized the fair value of all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges  to the extent the hedge was effective  were recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item was settled and recorded in oil and gas revenues 
for the year ended december   hedging settlement payments reduced oil and gas revenues by approximately million  and no gains or losses were recognized due to hedge ineffectiveness

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
a discussion of our market risk exposure in financial instruments follows 
foreign currency exchange rates because we operate in a number of countries throughout the world  we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the us dollar 
the functional currency for our international operations  other than our operations in the united kingdom  is the us dollar  but a portion of the revenues from our foreign operations is paid in foreign currencies 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations are partly mitigated because local expenses of such foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
we continually monitor the currency exchange risks associated with all contracts not denominated in the us dollar 
any gains or losses associated with such fluctuations have not been material 
we do not hold any foreign currency exchange forward contracts and or currency options 
we have not made use of derivative financial instruments to manage risks associated with existing or anticipated transactions 
we do not hold derivatives for trading purposes or use derivatives with complex features 
assets and liabilities of our subsidiary in the united kingdom are translated at current exchange rates  while income and expense are translated at average rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as the foreign currency translation component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
interest rates at december   none of our long term debt outstanding had variable interest rates  and we had no interest rate risks at that time 
equity price risk in december  we issued million of senior exchangeable notes due in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers 
the notes are  subject to the occurence of specified conditions  exchangeable for our common stock initially at an exchange price of per share  which would result in an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock being issued upon exchange 
we may redeem for cash all or any part of the notes on or after december  for of the principal amount redeemed 
the holders may require us to repurchase for cash all or any portion of the notes on december   december  and december  for of the principal amount of notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the notes do not contain any restrictive financial covenants 
each  of principal amount of the notes is initially exchangeable into shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
holders of the notes may exchange their notes prior to maturity only if the price of our common stock reaches during certain periods of time specified in the notes  specified corporate transactions occur  the notes have been called for redemption  or the trading price of the notes falls below a certain threshold 
in addition  in the event of a fundamental change in our corporate 
table of contents ownership or structure  the holders may require us to repurchase all or any portion of the notes for of the principal amount 
concurrently with the issuance of the notes  we entered into agreements with affiliates of the initial purchasers to purchase call options and sell warrants of our common stock 
we may exercise the call options at any time to acquire approximately million shares of our common stock at a strike price of per share 
the owners of the warrants may exercise their warrants to purchase from us approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  subject to certain anti dilution and other customary adjustments 
the warrants may be settled in cash  in shares or in a combination of cash and shares  at our option 
we paid million exclusive of a million tax benefit to acquire the call options and received million as a result of the sale of the warrants 
for additional discussion of the notes  see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources in part ii  item above 
commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future rate of growth partially depends upon the market prices of oil and natural gas 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of oil and gas that can economically be produced 
we use derivative commodity instruments to manage commodity price risks associated with future oil production 
we have not hedged any of our natural gas production 
our hedging contracts for a portion of our oil production expired on august   and there are no outstanding contracts as of december  or as of the date of this form k
