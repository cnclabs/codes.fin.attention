restatement of consolidated financial statements  audit committee  special litigation committee and company findings  remedial measures and related proceedings this annual report on form k for our fiscal year december  includes restatements of previously filed consolidated financial statements  financial data and related disclosures as of december  and for our fiscal years ended december  and  our selected consolidated financial data as of and for our page of 
table of contents fiscal years ended december     our quarter ended december   and our fiscal year ended september   our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of and for our fiscal years ended december  and contained in item of this form k  and our unaudited quarterly financial data for the first quarter of fiscal year ended december  and for all quarters in our fiscal year ended december  located at the end of item of this form k 
the restatements are the result of errors in the way we accounted for certain historical stock option grants that were discovered through our independent stock option investigation conducted by the audit committee of the board of directors 
see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  of notes to consolidated financial statements and exhibit for a detailed discussion of the effect of the restatements 
our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years and prior  which are included in our annual reports on form k  our quarterly reports on form q filed with respect to each of the applicable quarters in these fiscal years and the consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal year  should no longer be relied upon 
audit committee investigation of historical stock option practices in early  an academic study and numerous subsequent press reports began to publicize the likely widespread occurrence of accounting and corporate governance irregularities with respect to the granting of stock options and other equity awards at over companies  many in the high tech sector 
one report included rambus as one of the companies surveyed with a high risk of having backdated stock option grants 
as a result  in late may  we conducted an initial review in which we discovered apparent irregularities in past stock option grants and reported our findings to the audit committee and the board of directors 
on may   the audit committee commenced an internal investigation of the timing of past stock option grants and other related accounting issues 
each of the members of the audit committee had joined our board of directors and audit committee after january  the audit committee retained independent legal counsel and an independent accounting firm to assist in the investigation 
on july   the audit committee concluded that the actual dates of determination for certain past stock option grants differed from the originally stated grant dates for such awards 
because the prices at the originally stated grant dates were lower than the prices on the actual dates of the determination  we concluded that we should have recognized material amounts of stock based compensation expense which were not accounted for in our previously issued consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the audit committee and management concluded that our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years  and which were included in our annual report on form k  our quarterly reports on form q filed with respect to each of the applicable quarters in these fiscal years  and the consolidated financial statements included in our quarterly report on form q for the first quarter of fiscal year  should no longer be relied upon and would be restated 
findings and remedial actions by october   the audit committee had substantially completed its findings with respect to the timing of our historical stock option grants 
the independent investigation over the previous four months included a review of over stock option granting actions from the time of our initial public offering through the commencement of the investigation in late may the review encompassed over million emails and other documents  and over interviews with current and former executive officers  directors  employees and advisors 
page of 
table of contents the results of the investigation were consistent with the audit committee s earlier conclusion that our previously filed consolidated financial statements should no longer be relied upon 
we are disclosing the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the affected periods by filing this annual report on form k for the year ended december   which includes the restatement of the consolidated financial statements for the and fiscal years  as well as restated supplementary financial data for the first quarter of in addition  the errors we identified impacted our consolidated financial statements for the periods prior to the year ended december  in the restated consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  the cumulative impact of the errors as of december  is represented as a change to the opening balance of accumulated deficit  additional paid in capital and deferred taxes as of january  the impact of these errors will continue to have an effect on our consolidated financial statements for periods through fiscal the impact of these errors also extended to the quarter ended march  restated unaudited consolidated financial statements for the periods ended march  and  related restated management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for these periods and certain restated tables and disclosures related to apb  sfas and sfas r are included in exhibit we have filed interim consolidated financial statements on form q for the period ended june  and the period ended september  in these quarterly consolidated financial statements  the cumulative impact of the errors as of december  is represented as a change to the opening balance of accumulated deficit  additional paid in capital and deferred taxes as of january  other balance sheet items related to prior periods affected by the restatement are reflected in the opening balances of the consolidated balance sheet as of january  on august   the audit committee completed its investigation 
the audit committee concluded that there was retroactive pricing of stock options granted to nearly all employees who received options  primarily during the periods from september  to december   the retroactively priced options were not accounted for correctly in the company s previously issued consolidated financial statements  the retroactive pricing of options in many instances was intentional  not inadvertent or as a result of administrative error  the retroactive pricing of options involved the selection of low exercise prices by certain former executive officers  and other former executives may have been aware of this conduct  vesting terms on stock options for certain terminating employees were changed without proper authorization  and the retroactive pricing of options in many instances involved the falsification of stock option committee memoranda  unanimous written consents uwc and minutes of the compensation committee and offer letters to employees  resulting in erroneous statements being made in financial and other reports previously filed with the sec  as well as in information previously provided to the company s independent registered public accounting firm 
because the retroactive pricing was the result of the actions of only a few individuals  the board of directors decided that the company should continue to honor the retroactively priced options in most instances 
the audit committee further concluded that our former chief financial officers and controllers should have been more involved in understanding whether stock option grants were being properly accounted for  and either knew the proper accounting rules or should have taken steps to become aware of the proper accounting rules for stock option grants 
at the time of these practices  it was the reasonable practice of our former chief financial officers and controllers to rely on senior executives of the company to create accurate records of the stock option approvals and grants 
our former ceo participated in the approval of misdated stock option grants 
he knew or should have been aware of the fact that date selection practices were occurring and that the approval memoranda he signed were not properly reflecting the actual approval dates 
however  the audit committee also concluded that it was reasonable for the former ceo to believe that the senior vice president  administration was handling the company s stock option grants in accordance with the appropriate legal and accounting rules for stock option grants and understood the company s actual practices 
concurrent with the review by the audit committee  our management  under the oversight of the audit committee  completed an internal review in order to prepare the restated consolidated financial statements which included evaluations of our previous accounting for stock options and led to adjustments for a stock option grants for which the audit committee determined that the actual grant date for accounting purposes was different from the stated grant date for new hire grants to employees  annual and other grants to employees  and any grants to officers  b grants made to individuals who had extensions of option termination dates and  in some cases  extensions of vesting periods pursuant to separation agreements under which the individuals did not perform any significant duties during the separation period but were still listed as employees  c payroll tax withholding liabilities for certain repriced stock grants that no longer qualify for incentive stock option iso tax treatment  and d other miscellaneous adjustments for modifications and errors  including adjustments for grants to non employees providing consulting services and adjustments for continued vesting after an individual converted from an employee to a consultant role 
summary of accounting adjustments by category these restated consolidated financial statements include adjustments that are primarily related to the stock option matters as well as adjustments that are related to other matters resulting from our internal review and the preparation of these restated consolidated financial statements 
the primary components of the restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements related to stock based compensation are as follows new hire grants to employees we determined that during the period from february through october  the individuals responsible for stock option grants to newly hired non executive employees had a regular practice of selecting an exercise price equal to the lowest price of the quarter between the employee s start date and the end of the quarter for such grants 
on certain occasions  individual employees were given a formal employment start date which preceded the date on which they actually began working for us 
the result of this practice was that certain employees received a new hire grant at a grant price that was lower than the price of the stock on the employee s actual start date 
page of 
table of contents there were three new hire grants to non executive employees between october and december for which there were administrative errors made by our human resources department 
there were no material measurement date differences relating to grants to non executive new hires in fiscal years and annual and other grants to employees we determined that between september and october  the stock option committee granted approximately million stock options to non executive employees for which the appropriate measurement dates differed from the recorded grant dates 
the stock option committee during this time period consisted of our ceo  geoff tate  as its sole member 
the majority of the measurement date differences during this time period were caused by the creation of incorrect documentation concerning the date on which the stock options were approved 
the human resources department usually created stock option committee memoranda reflecting stock option grants which purported to issue the grants on certain dates which differed from the actual dates on which the approvals were obtained 
in october the stock option committee was dissolved and this practice ceased 
in late and there were grants to non executive employees for which the price was set on the same date that the compensation committee had met and discussed a pool of stock options 
however  the individual allocations of the stock option pool had not been completed by management until after the date of those meetings and  consequently  we recorded a retroactively selected measurement date for those grants 
there were no material measurement date differences related to new hires or annual grants to officers in the fiscal year and grants to officers we determined that  during each of the years between and  officers were granted stock options that were not approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors on the date listed on the approval documentation 
instead  on some occasions  the dates were selected to coincide with a low price for a period 
the grants were typically documented using a unanimous written consent uwc prepared in most instances by the human resources department 
the uwcs did not appropriately reflect that the approval date was not the date indicated in the document 
with the following exceptions  this practice appears to have ended after between december and january there were instances where officers received a new hire grant that was dated on a date different from the date on which the compensation committee approved the grant 
each of these grants was documented using a uwc prepared by the human resources department 
the uwcs did not appropriately reflect that the approval date was not the date indicated in the document 
this practice  with one exception in january  appears to have ended in july in late  there was one granting action for which the exercise price of the options coincided with the date of a compensation committee meeting  but for which we were unable to establish that all of the specific allocations and approvals had been completed as of the date of that meeting 
consequently  we have concluded that the grants relating to some of the officers receiving that grant had incorrect measurement dates 
there were no material measurement date differences relating to annual or other grants to non executive employees in the fiscal years and extension of termination dates we determined that from to march we had not maintained accurate documentation  and had not properly accounted for stock based compensation  for stock options granted to individuals who had extensions of option termination dates and  in some cases  extensions of vesting periods pursuant to separation agreements under which the individuals did not perform any significant duties during the separation period but were still listed as employees 
these types of modifications were not always communicated to our finance department  were not identified in our financial reporting processes and were therefore not properly reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
page of 
table of contents payroll tax withholding liability we determined that certain of our stock grants which had incorrect measurement dates for accounting purposes had been originally issued as incentive stock options but no longer qualified for iso tax treatment 
the disqualification of the iso classification and the resulting conversion to non qualified stock option nso status exposes us to additional withholding taxes and penalties for failure to properly withhold taxes on the exercise of those options 
these expenses reverse in the period in which the related statute of limitations expires 
other stock based compensation adjustments we determined that other miscellaneous modifications and errors had occurred related to employee options that were not identified in our financial reporting processes and therefore not properly reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
these miscellaneous items included adjustments for grants to non employees providing consulting services  adjustments for continued vesting after an individual converted from an employee to a consultant and adjustments in related to the accounting for our employee stock purchase plan espp under fas r 
in connection with the restatement  we and the audit committee conducted certain investigative procedures to determine whether we could continue to rely upon the work performed by the accounting  finance and legal personnel as it relates to fiscal   and prior periods  and the extent to which our prior accounting and controls for non stock option related matters could be relied upon for purposes of the preparation and certification of the restated consolidated financial statements 
in this process  and our internal review of other accounting items relating to transactions occurring in fiscal years through  we identified certain other errors in accounting determinations and judgments which  although immaterial  have been reflected in the restated consolidated financial statements 
these primarily include timing differences for revenue and expense recognition and certain balance sheet reclassifications 
we previously applied apb and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under sfas through our fiscal year ended december  under the provisions of apb  a non cash  stock based compensation expense was required to be recognized for any option granted for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date 
because most of our remeasured options had an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date  there should have been a non cash charge for each of these options under apb equal to the number of option shares  multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the actual grant date 
that expense should have been amortized over the vesting period of the options 
starting in fiscal  we adopted sfas r 
as a result  beginning in fiscal year  stock based compensation expense required to be recorded for each remeasured option is equal to the fair value of the option on the actual grant date  amortized over the remaining expected requisite service period of the option 
we did not record these stock based compensation expenses under apb or sfas r in our previously issued consolidated financial statements  and that is why we are restating them in this filing 
restatement and impact on consolidated financial statements as a result of the issues identified  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense of million under apb for the period between may  the date of our initial public offering and december   comprised of million related to remeasured stock options and million related to other stock compensation adjustments 
the cumulative tax benefit from the recording of these adjustments was million 
the impact of these adjustments  net of taxes  decreased our previously reported cumulative net income by million for the same period 
the tax benefit amount differs from the statutory tax benefit principally as a result of limitations on our ability to deduct certain executive stock based compensation and changes in geographical mix of expenses 
for the year ended december   in accordance with sfas r  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense of million comprised of million related to these remeasured stock options and million related to other stock compensation adjustments 
as of december   we have million of unrecognized pre tax stock based compensation costs calculated under sfas r related to remeasured stock option grants that will be recorded as compensation expense over the remaining expected requisite service period of the options 
page of 
table of contents approximately million of the total stock based compensation expenses  representing adjustments from through  have been reflected  net of income tax effects of million  as an increase of million to accumulated deficit in the opening balance sheet for fiscal because certain options formerly classified as iso grants were determined to have been granted with an exercise price below the fair market value of our stock on the actual grant date  they do not qualify for iso tax treatment 
the disqualification of iso classification and the resulting conversion to nso status exposes us to additional withholding taxes and penalties for failing to properly withhold taxes on exercise of those options 
through december   we recorded a tax liability of million in connection with this disqualification of such iso tax treatment for tax years ending december  through december  of the total liability  million was related to fiscal and was paid in fiscal these amounts are included in the other stock based compensation adjustments discussed above 
we are currently under irs remote examination with regard to this issue 
we were unable to record additional deferred tax assets related to stock based compensation in accordance with limits imposed by section m of the internal revenue code on certain executive compensation 
consequently  we were required to reduce our available tax net operating loss carry forwards arising from certain exercised stock options by million for periods through december  because of this section m limitation 
for explanatory purposes  we have classified the stock option and other adjustments that were affected by the restatement into the aforementioned categories as presented below 
the classified amounts involve certain subjective judgments by us to the extent particular stock option related accounting errors may fall within more than one category as such  the table below should be considered a reasonable representation of the magnitude of expenses in each category 
for the fiscal years ended december  and september   we had previously recorded stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  with a related tax benefit of million and million  respectively  in our reported consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal and  total stock based compensation  as restated  was million and million  respectively  with a related tax benefit of million and million  respectively

these expenses were approximately million for the year ended december   including an accrual of million related to the potential settlement of the class action lawsuit pertaining to the accounting for stock option grants and related disclosures 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  litigation and asserted claims 
through the second quarter of fiscal year  we have incurred additional expenses of approximately million for the above noted activities 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the derivative and private lawsuits and other stock option investigation related matters 
regulatory inquiries related to historical stock option practices we have periodically met and discussed the results of the stock option investigation with the staff of the sec and the united states attorney s office for the northern district of california 
such government agencies will likely review such findings and may pursue inquiries of their own  which could lead to further investigations and government action  such as fines or injunctions 
at this time  we cannot predict what  if any  government actions may result from the completion of the investigation 
there is no assurance that other regulatory inquiries will not be commenced by other us federal  state or foreign regulatory agencies 
any potential regulatory proceeding or action may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business 
an unfavorable outcome or significant judgments  settlements and legal expenses related to resolution of any potential regulatory proceeding or action  or further restatement of our consolidated financial statements  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we will continue to cooperate with the appropriate government authorities regarding the investigation

business overview we design  develop and license chip interface technologies and architectures that are foundational to nearly all digital electronics products 
our chip interface technologies are designed to improve the time to market  performance and cost effectiveness of our customers semiconductor and system products for computing  communications and consumer electronics applications 
as of may   our chip interface technologies are covered by more than us and international patents 
additionally  we have approximately patent applications currently pending 
these patents and patent applications cover important inventions in memory and logic chip interfaces  in addition to other technologies 
we believe that our chip interface technologies provide a higher performance  lower risk  and more cost effective alternative for our customers than can be achieved through their own internal research and development efforts 
we offer our customers two alternatives for using our chip interface technologies in their products first  we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and system companies who use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
patent license agreements are royalty bearing 
second  we develop leadership which are rambus proprietary products widely licensed to our customers and industry standard chip interface products that we provide to our customers under license for incorporation into their semiconductor and system products 
because of the often complex nature of implementing state of the art chip interface technology  we offer our customers a range of engineering services to help them successfully integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems 
product license agreements may have both a fixed price non recurring component and ongoing royalties 
engineering services are customarily bundled with our product licenses  and are generally performed on a fixed price basis 
further  under product licenses  our customers may receive licenses to our patents necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
we derive the majority of our annual revenues by licensing our broad portfolio of patents for chip interfaces to our customers 
such licenses may cover part or all of our patent portfolio 
leading semiconductor and system companies such as amd  elpida  fujitsu  qimonda  intel  matsushita  necel  renesas  spansion and toshiba have licensed our patents for use in their own products 
page of 
table of contents we derive additional revenues by licensing our leadership and industry standard chip interface products to our customers for use in their semiconductor and system products 
our customers include leading companies such as elpida  fujitsu  ibm  intel  matsushita  texas instruments  sony  st micro  qimonda and toshiba 
due to the complex nature of implementing our technologies  we provide engineering services under certain of these licenses to help successfully integrate our chip interface products into their semiconductors and systems 
additionally  product licensees may receive  as an adjunct to their chip interface license agreements  patent licenses as necessary to implement the chip interface in their products with specific rights and restrictions to the applicable patents elaborated in their individual contracts 
royalties represent a substantial portion of our total revenues 
the remaining part of our revenue is engineering services revenue which includes license fees and engineering services fees 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we have a high degree of revenue concentration  with our top five licensees representing  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
for the twelve months ended december   revenues from fujitsu  elpida  qimonda and intel  each accounted for greater than of total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   revenue from intel  elpida  toshiba and matsushita  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   revenue from intel  toshiba and elpida  each accounted for greater than of our total revenues 
our revenues from companies based outside of north america accounted for  and of our revenues for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
we expect that we will have significant revenues from companies based outside the united states for the foreseeable future and our revenue concentration will decrease over time as we license new customers 
historically  we have been involved in significant litigation stemming from the unlicensed use of our inventions 
our litigation expenses have been high and difficult to predict at this time and we anticipate future litigation expenses to continue to be significant  volatile and difficult to predict 
if we are successful in the litigation and or related licensing  our revenue could be substantially higher in the future  if we are unsuccessful  our revenue would likely decline 
revenue concentration as indicated above  we have a high degree of revenue concentration 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses the particular licensees which account for revenue concentration have varied from period to period as a result of the addition of new contracts  expiration of existing contracts  industry consolidation  the expiration of deferred revenue schedules under existing contracts  and the volumes and prices at which the licensees have recently sold licensed semiconductors to system companies 
these variations are expected to continue in the foreseeable future  although we expect that our revenue concentration will decrease over time as we license new customers 
the royalties we receive are partly a function of the adoption of our chip interfaces by system companies 
many system companies purchase semiconductors containing our chip interfaces from our licensees and do not have a direct contractual relationship with us 
our licensees generally do not provide us with details as to the identity or volume of licensed semiconductors purchased by particular system companies 
as a result  we face difficulty in analyzing the extent to which our future revenues will be dependent upon particular system companies 
system companies face intense competitive pressure in their markets  which are characterized by extreme volatility  frequent new product introductions and rapidly shifting consumer preferences 
there can be no assurance as to the unit volumes of licensed semiconductors that will be purchased by these companies in the future or as to the level of royalty bearing revenues that our licensees will receive from sales to these companies 
additionally  there can be no assurance that a significant number of other system companies will adopt our chip interfaces or that our dependence upon particular system companies will decrease in the future 
page of 
table of contents international revenues we expect that revenues derived from international licensees will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in the future 
to date  all of the revenues from international licensees have been denominated in us dollars 
however  to the extent that such licensees sales to systems companies are not denominated in us dollars  any royalties that we receive as a result of such sales could be subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  if the effective price of licensed semiconductors sold by our foreign licensees were to increase as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of the relevant currencies  demand for licensed semiconductors could fall  which in turn would reduce our royalties 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge foreign exchange rate risk 
for additional information concerning international revenues  see note  business segments  exports and major customers of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
expenses we intend to continue making significant expenditures associated with engineering  marketing  general and administration including litigation expenses  and expect that these costs and expenses will continue to be a significant percentage of revenues in future periods 
whether such expenses increase or decrease as a percentage of revenues will be substantially dependent upon the rate at which our revenues change

engineering costs are allocated between cost of contract revenues and research and development expenses 
cost of contract revenues reflects the portion of the total engineering costs which are specifically devoted to individual licensee development and support services 
the balance of engineering costs  incurred for the development of generally applicable chip interface technologies  is charged to research and development 
in a given period  the allocation of engineering costs between these two components is a function of the timing of the development and implementation schedules of individual licensee contracts 
marketing  general and administrative 
marketing  general and administrative expenses include expenses and costs associated with trade shows  public relations  advertising  legal  finance  insurance and other marketing and administrative efforts 
litigation expenses are a significant portion of our marketing  general and administrative expenses and they can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
consistent with our business model  sales and marketing activities are focused on developing relationships with potential licensees and on participating with existing licensees in marketing  sales and technical efforts directed to system companies 
in many cases  we must dedicate substantial resources to the marketing and support of system companies 
due to the long business development cycles we face and the semi fixed nature of marketing  general and administrative expenses in a given period  these expenses generally do not correlate to the level of revenues in that period or in recent or future periods 
taxes 
we report certain items of income and expense for financial reporting purposes in different years than they are reported for tax purposes 
we report contract fees and royalties when received for tax purposes  as required by tax law 
we recognize revenue for financial reporting purposes as such amounts are earned and this could occur over several reporting periods 
as a result of the above and other differences between tax and financial reporting for income and expense recognition  our net operating profit or loss for tax purposes may be more or less than the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes

twelve months ended december  to change to change dollars in millions total revenues contract revenues royalties total revenues contract revenues percentage of completion contracts for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   percentage of completion contract revenue decreased approximately million due to completion of leadership chip interface contracts during  including xdr and flexio 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the twelve months ended december   percentage of completion contract revenue increased approximately million due to new xdr and flexio chip interface contracts offset in part by the decrease in recognition of revenue associated with xdr  flexio and serial link chip interface contracts originating prior to page of 
table of contents we believe that percentage of completion contract revenues recognized will continue to fluctuate over time  based on our ongoing contractual requirements  the amount of work performed  and by changes to work required  as well as new contracts booked in the future 
other contracts for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  revenue which is recognized over the estimated service periods or on a completed contract basis increased approximately million due to increased revenue from industry standard and leadership chip interface contracts 
for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  revenue which is recognized over the estimated service periods increased approximately million primarily due to the increase in recognition of revenue associated with ddr  serial link  xdr and flexio contracts 
royalty revenues patent licenses in the twelve months ended december   and  our largest source of royalties was related to the license of our patents for sdr and ddr compatible products 
royalties increased approximately million for sdr and ddr compatible products in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the increase is primarily due to revenue from licensees signed in and the first quarter of  including fujitsu  amd and qimonda  partially offset by decreased royalties from samsung and matsushita 
royalties increased approximately million for sdr and ddr compatible products in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to increased shipment volumes of sdr and ddr controllers and the first quarterly royalty payment from qimonda 
as of december   we had both variable and fixed royalty agreements for our sdr and ddr compatible licenses 
on december   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with amd 
we expect to recognize royalty revenues under the amd agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable because the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
we recognized royalty revenues of million in fiscal year  and we expect to recognize million in fiscal years through and million in the fiscal year under the amd agreement 
the amd agreement provides a license to our patents used in the design of ddr  ddr  fb dimm  pci express and xdr controllers as well as other current and future high speed memory and logic controller interfaces 
on march   we entered into a five year patent license agreement with fujitsu 
we expect to recognize royalty revenues under the fujitsu agreement on a quarterly basis as amounts become due and payable as the contractual terms of the agreement provide for payments on an extended term basis 
we recognized a total of million of royalty revenues in fiscal year the fujitsu agreement provides a license that covers semiconductors  components and systems  but does not include a license to fujitsu for its own manufacturing of commodity sdram other than limited amounts of sdr sdram annually 
on march   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with infineon and its former parent siemens  which was assigned to qimonda in october in connection with infineon s spin off of qimonda 
the settlement and license agreement  among other things  requires qimonda to pay to us aggregate royalties of million in quarterly installments of million  which started on november  the settlement and license agreement further provides that if we enter into licenses with certain other dram manufacturers  qimonda will be required to make additional royalty payments to us which may aggregate up to million 
if we do not succeed in entering into these additional license agreements necessary to trigger qimonda s obligations  qimonda s quarterly payments will decrease to million in the fourth quarter of and then cease in the first quarter of if that were to occur  the quarterly payments would not recommence until we enter into these additional license agreements 
page of 
table of contents we are in negotiations with new prospective licensees 
we expect sdr and ddr compatible royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our success adding new licensees  as well as the level of variation in our licensees reported shipment volumes  sales price and mix  offset in part by the proportion of licensee payments that are fixed 
on february   the ftc issued its remedy order  which among other things  imposes maximum royalty rates that we can collect for sdr and ddr sdram products shipped after april   the ftc subsequently granted a partial stay of this order  which allows us to charge but not collect royalties above the ftc imposed maximums  pending our anticipated appeal of the ftc s decision 
the ftc has allowed that royalties above these maximums be placed into an escrow account or held by a contingent contractual agreement 
we expect that there will be a decrease in sdr and ddr compatible royalty revenues as a result of the ftc order beginning in the third quarter of the intel patent cross license agreement represented the second largest source of royalties in the twelve months ended december   and royalties under this agreement decreased from million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same periods in  and were unchanged in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in the patent cross license agreement expired in september and no further royalty payments are owed to us under it 
intel now has a paid up license for the use of all of our patents which claimed priority prior to september product licenses in the twelve months ended december   and  royalties from rdram compatible products represented the third largest source of royalties 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in approximately million 
royalties from rdram memory chips and controllers decreased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in approximately million 
rdram is approaching end of life and in the future  we expect rdram royalties will continue to decline 
royalties from xdr  flexio  ddr and serial link compatible products represent the fourth largest category of royalties 
royalties from xdr  flexio and serial link compatible products increased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in approximately million 
the increase of xdr  flexio and serial link compatible products for over is primarily due to increased volumes of xdr dram associated with shipments of the sony playstation product 
royalties from xdr  flexio and serial link compatible products increased during the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period in approximately million 
this increase was primarily due to minimum guaranteed royalties from a contract for serial link compatible products 
in the future  we expect xdr  flexio and serial link royalties will continue to vary from period to period based on our licensees shipment volumes  sales prices  and product mix 
we expect that xdr and flexio royalties will increase associated with shipments of the sony playstation product

in certain periods  the cost of contract revenues may exceed contract revenues 
this can be a result of expensing pre contract costs  expensing completed contract costs where the realizability of an asset is uncertain  and low utilization of project resources 
in the near term  we expect engineering costs will continue to increase as we make investments in the infrastructure and technologies required to maintain our leadership position in chip interface technologies and increase headcount

in the twelve months ended december   our effective tax rate was approximately  as compared with an effective rate of approximately for the comparable period in the change in effective tax rate is primarily due to tax benefits from stock related compensation expense related to officers  disqualifying disposition of espps and r d credit  offset by non deductible stock related compensation expense 
the tax rate is higher than the statutory rate  primarily due to the r d credit  partially offset by the lack of deductibility of stock based compensation expense 
while we do not expect any impact to the effective tax rate for us non qualified stock option or restricted stock expense due to the adoption of sfas r  the effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by foreign stock option expense and stock option expense related to executive officers that may not be deductible 
also  sfas r requires that the tax benefit of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and espps be recorded in the period of disqualifying disposition 
this could result in significant fluctuations in our effective tax rate between reporting periods 
the effective tax rate for is lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the tax benefit from stock related compensation expense

default interest on the notes accrues at a rate of per annum from the date on which full payment of the notes is due to the date that full payment is made 
as of december   we have reclassified the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes of million from non current liabilities to current liabilities and reflected them as due in less than one year in the following table

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition overview our revenue recognition policy is based on the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition sop as amended by statement of position sop and statement of position sop 
for certain of our revenue contracts  revenue is recognized according to statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
in application of the specific authoritative literature cited above  we comply with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting concepts no 
and we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
if any of these criteria are not met  we defer recognizing the revenue until such time as all criteria are met 
determination of whether or not these criteria have been met may require us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates based upon current information and historical experience 
our revenue consists of royalty revenues and contract revenues generated from agreements with semiconductor companies  system companies and certain reseller arrangements 
royalty revenues consist of patent license royalties and product license royalties 
contract revenues consist of fixed license fees  fixed engineering fees and service fees associated with integration of our chip interface products into our customers products 
contract revenues may also page of 
table of contents include support or maintenance 
reseller arrangements generally provide for the pass through of a percentage of the fees paid to the reseller by its customer for use of our patent and product licenses 
we do not recognize revenue for these arrangements until we have received notice of revenue earned by and paid to the reseller  accompanied by the pass through payment from the reseller 
we do not pay commissions to the reseller for these arrangements 
many of our licensees have the right to cancel their licenses 
in such arrangements revenue is only recognized to the extent that is consistent with the cancellation provisions 
cancellation provisions within such contracts generally provide for a prospective cancellation with no refund of fees already remitted by customers for products provided and payments for services rendered prior to the date of cancellation 
unbilled receivables represent enforceable claims and are deemed collectible in connection with our revenue recognition policy 
royalty revenues we recognize royalty revenues upon notification by the licensees and if collectibility is reasonably assured 
the terms of the royalty agreements generally either require licensees to give us notification and to pay the royalties within days of the end of the quarter during which the sales occur or are based on a fixed royalty that is due within days of the end of the quarter 
from time to time  we engage accounting firms other than our independent registered public accounting firm to perform  on our behalf  periodic audits of some of the licensee s reports of royalties to us and any adjustment resulting from such royalty audits is recorded in the period such adjustment is determined 
we have two types of royalty revenues patent license royalties and product license royalties 
patent licenses 
we license our broad portfolio of patented inventions to semiconductor and systems companies to use these inventions in the development and manufacture of their own products 
such licensing agreements may cover the license of part  or all  of our patent portfolio 
we generally recognize revenue from these arrangements as amounts become due and payable 
the contractual terms of the agreements generally provide for payments over an extended period of time 
product licenses 
we develop proprietary and industry standard chip interface products  such as rdram and xdr that we provide to our customers under product license agreements 
these arrangements include royalties  which can be based on either a percentage of sales or number of units sold 
we recognize revenue from these arrangements upon notification from the licensee and if collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract revenues we generally recognize revenue in accordance the provisions of sop for development contracts related to licenses of our chip interface products  such as xdr and flexio that involve significant engineering and integration services 
revenues derived from such license and engineering services may be recognized using the completed contract or percentage of completion method 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based upon labor hours incurred 
we have evaluated use of output measures versus input measures and have determined that our output is not sufficiently uniform with respect to cost  time and effort per unit of output to use output measures as a measure of progress to completion 
part of these contract fees may be due upon the achievement of certain milestones  such as provision of certain deliverables by us or production of chips by the licensee 
the remaining fees may be due on pre determined dates and include significant up front fees 
a provision for estimated losses on fixed price contracts is made  if necessary  in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the work required to complete a contract  the total amount of revenue recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  to the extent the new assumptions regarding the total amount of work necessary to complete a project were less than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized sooner than originally expected 
page of 
table of contents conversely  if the newly estimated total amount of work necessary to complete a project was longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees will be recognized over a longer period 
if there is significant uncertainty about the time to complete or the deliverables by either party  we evaluate the appropriateness of applying the completed contract method of accounting under sop such evaluation is completed by us on a contract by contract basis 
for all contracts where revenue recognition must be delayed until the contract deliverables are substantially complete  we evaluate the realizability of the assets which the accumulated costs would represent and defer or expense as incurred based upon the conclusions of our realization analysis 
if application of the percentage of completion method results in recognizable revenue prior to an invoicing event under a customer contract  we will recognize the revenue and record an unbilled receivable 
amounts invoiced to our customers in excess of recognizable revenues are recorded as deferred revenues 
the timing and amounts invoiced to customers can vary significantly depending on specific contract terms and can therefore have a significant impact on deferred revenues or unbilled receivables in any given period 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  sop and sop for development contracts related to licenses of our chip interface products that involve non essential engineering services and post contract support pcs 
these sops apply to all entities that earn revenue on products containing software  where software is not incidental to the product as a whole 
contract fees for the products and services provided under these arrangements are comprised of license fees and engineering service fees which are not essential to the functionality of the product 
our rates for pcs and for engineering services are specific to each development contract and not standardized in terms of rates or length 
because of these characteristics  we do not have a sufficient population of contracts from which to derive vendor specific objective evidence 
therefore  as required by sop  after we deliver the product  if the only undelivered element is pcs  we will recognize revenue ratably over either the contractual pcs period or the period during which pcs is expected to be provided 
we review assumptions regarding the pcs periods on a regular basis 
if we determine that it is necessary to revise the estimates of the support periods  the total amount of revenue to be recognized over the life of the contract would not be affected 
however  if the new estimated periods were shorter than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a shorter period 
conversely  if the new estimated periods were longer than the original assumptions  the contract fees would be recognized ratably over a longer period 
litigation we are involved in certain legal proceedings  as discussed in note  litigation and asserted claims of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
based upon consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters and an analysis of potential results  we accrue for losses related to litigation if we determine that a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
if a specific loss amount cannot be estimated  we review the range of possible outcomes and accrue the low end of the range of estimates 
any such accrual would be charged to expense in the appropriate period 
we recognize litigation expenses in the period in which the litigation services were provided 
income taxes as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to calculate the income tax expense or benefit which relates to the pretax income or loss for the period 
in addition  we are required to assess the realization of the tax asset or liability to be included on the consolidated balance sheet as of the reporting dates 
this process requires us to calculate various items including permanent and temporary differences between the financial accounting and tax treatment of certain income and expense items  differences between federal and state tax treatment of these items  the amount of taxable income reported to various states  foreign taxes and tax credits 
the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes results in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included on our consolidated balance sheet 
page of 
table of contents at december   our balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of approximately million  relating primarily to the difference between tax and book treatment of depreciation and amortization  employee stock related compensation expenses  net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets based on all available evidence  both positive and negative 
future taxable income and other factors determine how much benefit we ultimately realize from deferred tax assets 
if our estimate of future taxable income or the overall expected realizability of the deferred tax assets changes  a valuation allowance may have to be recorded  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operation 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based awards and our employee stock purchase plan using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for certain transactions involving stock based compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 fasb technical bulletin no 
ftb accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas accounting for stock based compensation 
in accordance with apb  a non cash  stock based compensation expense was recognized for any options for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date and for any grants that were modified from their original terms 
the charge for the options with an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date was equal to the number of options multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date 
that expense was amortized over the vesting period of the options 
the charge for modifications of options in general was equal to the number of options modified multiplied by the difference between the market price of the options on the modification date and the grant price 
the charge for modified options was taken over the remaining service period  if any 
see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the restatement of our financial statements for periods prior to january  effective january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement at fair value and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards 
we selected the modified prospective method of adoption which recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of all stock based payments granted after january  and for the fair value of all awards granted to employees prior to january  that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
we use the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock option and employee stock purchase plan espp awards consistent with the provisions of sfas r 
the bsm option pricing model requires the estimation of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include expected volatility  expected life of the award  expected dividend rate and expected risk free rate of return 
the assumptions for expected volatility and expected life are the two assumptions that most significantly affect the grant date fair value 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the implied volatility of the company s page of 
table of contents common stock 
we use implied volatility for both our stock options and espp shares based on freely traded options in the open market  as we believe implied volatility is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than historical or blended volatility 
if there is not sufficient volume in our market traded options for any period  we will use an equally weighted blend of historical and implied volatility 
the expected term assumption for our stock option grants was determined using a monte carlo simulation model which projects future option holder behavior patterns based upon actual historical option exercises 
sfas r also requires the application of a forfeiture rate to the calculated fair value of stock options on a prospective basis 
our assumption of forfeiture rate represents the historical rate at which our stock based awards were surrendered prior to vesting over the trailing four years 
if our assumption of forfeiture rate changes  we would have to make a cumulative adjustment in the current period 
we monitor the assumptions used to compute the fair value of our stock options and espp awards on a regular basis and we will revise our assumptions as appropriate 
in the event that assumptions used to compute the fair value of these awards are later determined to be inaccurate or if we change our assumptions significantly in future periods  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  primarily arising from the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our investment portfolio 
interest rate fluctuation may arise from changes in the market s view of the quality of the security issuer  the overall economic outlook  and the time to maturity of our portfolio 
we mitigate this risk by investing only in high quality  highly liquid instruments 
securities with original maturities of one year or less must be rated by two of the three industry standard rating agencies as follows a by standard poor s  p by moody s and or f by fitch 
securities with original maturities of greater than one year must be rated by two of the following industry standard rating agencies as follows aa by standard poor s  aa by moody s and or aa by fitch 
by corporate policy  we limit the amount of our credit exposure to million for any one commercial issuer 
our policy requires that at least of the portfolio be in securities with a maturity of days or less 
in addition  we may make investments in securities with maturities up to months 
however  the bias of our investment policy is toward shorter maturities 
we invest our cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of us dollar financial instruments such as treasuries  government agencies  repurchase agreements  commercial paper and bankers acceptance 
our policy specifically prohibits trading securities for the sole purposes of realizing trading profits 
however  we may liquidate a portion of our portfolio if we experience unforeseen liquidity requirements 
in such a case if the environment has been one of rising interest rates we may experience a realized loss  similarly  if the environment has been one of declining interest rates we may experience a realized gain 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income marketable securities of million excluding cash and cash equivalents 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels as of december   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
actual results may differ materially from this sensitivity analysis 
we bill our customers in us dollars 
although the fluctuation of currency exchange rates may impact our customers  and thus indirectly impact us  we do not attempt to hedge this indirect and speculative risk 
our overseas operations consist primarily of business development offices of from to people in any one country and one design center in india 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure  however  as of december   our foreign currency exposure is not material enough to warrant foreign currency hedging
