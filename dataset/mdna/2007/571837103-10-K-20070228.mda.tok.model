item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the corporation s overall strategy is to drive earnings per share growth by expanding banking operations not only in wisconsin but also into faster growing regions beyond wisconsin  increasing the number of financial institutions to which the corporation provides correspondent banking services and products  growing metavante s business through organic growth  cross sales of technology products and acquisitions  and expanding trust services and other wealth management product and service offerings 
the corporation continues to focus on its key metrics of growing revenues through balance sheet growth  fee based income growth and strong credit quality 
management believes that the corporation has demonstrated solid fundamental performance in each of these key areas and as a result  the year ended december  produced strong financial results across all of its segments and reporting units 
net income in amounted to million or per diluted share 
the return on average assets and return on average equity were and  respectively 
by comparison  net income in was million  diluted earnings per share was  the return on average assets was and the return on average equity was 
for the year ended december   net income was million or per diluted share and the returns on average assets and average equity were and  respectively 
net income for the year ended december  included the impact of the mark to market adjustments associated with certain interest rate swaps 
based on expanded interpretations of the accounting standard for derivatives and hedge accounting  specifically hedge designation under the matched terms method  it was determined that certain transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting 
as a result  any fluctuation in the fair value of the interest rate swaps was recorded in earnings with no corresponding offset to the hedged items or accumulated other comprehensive income 
the affected interest rate swaps were designed to hedge the change in fair values or cash flows of the underlying assets or liabilities and had performed effectively as economic hedges 
applying fair value accounting versus hedge accounting resulted in greater earnings volatility  particularly on a linked quarter basis 
the affected interest rate swaps were terminated in in order to avoid future earnings volatility due to mark to market accounting 
the impact  which is reported as net derivative losses discontinued hedges in the consolidated statements of income  resulted in a decrease to net income of million or per diluted share 
management believes these changes in earnings based on market volatility are not reflective of the core performance trends of the corporation 
excluding the changes in earnings based on market volatility  for the year ended december  net income and diluted earnings per share would have been million and per share respectively  and the return on average assets and return on average equity would have been and  respectively 
the resulting growth in income and diluted earnings per share in compared to would have been million or and per share or  respectively 
a reconciliation of these non gaap generally accepted accounting principles operating results to gaap results is provided later in this item 
earnings growth in compared to was attributable to a number of factors 
the increase in net interest income was due to strong organic loan and bank issued deposit growth and the contribution from the two banking acquisitions that were completed on april  net charge offs continued to be below the corporation s five year historical average in metavante continued to exhibit growth in both revenue and earnings that was attributable  in part  to new sales  the impact of its acquisition activities and success in retaining and cross selling products and services to its core customer base 
continued growth in assets under management and assets under administration resulted in solid growth in fee income for wealth management 
although an unpredictable source of earnings  the corporation s capital markets group investment securities gains were relatively insignificant in compared to the past two years 
these factors  along with continued expense management  all contributed to the consolidated earnings growth in 
table of contents with regard to the outlook in for the banking segment  management expects modest net interest margin compression of up to a few basis points per quarter to continue 
commercial and industrial loan growth is expected to moderate slightly  and is expected to show low double digit growth rates 
commercial real estate growth is expected to be in the mid single digit percentage range 
nonperforming loans and leases as a percent of total loans and leases are expected to be in the range of basis points to basis points 
management expects metavante s total revenue in to be in the range of billion to billion with margins similar to those achieved in management continues to expect that net charge offs will trend to historical levels and range from basis points to basis points of average loans and leases over time

both acquisition related and organic loan growth  as well as the growth in noninterest bearing and other bank issued deposits  were the primary contributors to the increase in net interest income

average home equity loans and lines decreased billion in compared to management attributes the strong loan growth in to the strength of the local economies in the markets the corporation serves  new business and continued customer satisfaction 
management expects that organic commercial loan growth as a percentage will moderate slightly from growth levels and will reach the low double digits in the basis for this expectation includes continued success in attracting new customers in all of the corporation s markets and continued modest economic growth in the primary markets that the corporation serves 
recently the corporation has experienced some declines in the construction market for both commercial and residential developers  and to some extent throughout the commercial real estate business 
based on recent trends  management expects mid single digit growth in for commercial real estate loans 
home equity loans and lines  which include m i s wholesale activity  continue to be the primary consumer loan products 
average home equity loans and lines declined billion or in compared to this trend is consistent with what is occurring in many parts of the country 
the softer home equity market  combined with the corporation s continued sales of certain loans at origination  which is partly in response to the corporation s demand for home equity products with higher loan to value characteristics  will continue to affect balance sheet organic loan growth 
management does not expect this trend to change in the near term

noninterest deposit balances tend to exhibit some seasonality with a trend of balances declining somewhat in the early part of the year followed by growth in balances throughout the remainder of the year 
a portion of the noninterest balances  especially commercial balances  is sensitive to the interest rate environment 
larger balances tend to be maintained when overall interest rates are low and smaller balances tend to be maintained as overall interest rates increase 
as interest rates have risen  the corporation has increasingly been able to competitively price deposit products which has contributed to the growth in average interest bearing bank issued deposits and average bank issued time deposits 
the interest rate environment in resulted in a shift in the bank issued deposit mix 
in their search for higher yields  both new and existing customers have been migrating their deposit balances to higher cost money market and time deposit products 
however  new customer balances have resulted in less reliance on wholesale funding sources in management expects these trends to continue 

table of contents in commercial banking  the focus remains on developing deeper relationships by capitalizing on cross sale opportunities 
incentive plans based on the sale of treasury management products and services are focused on growing deposits 
the retail banking strategy continues to focus on aggressively selling the right products to meet the needs of customers and enhance the corporation s profitability 
wholesale deposits are funds in the form of deposits generated through distribution channels other than the corporation s own banking branches 
the corporation continues to make use of wholesale funding alternatives 
these deposits allow the corporation s bank subsidiaries to gather funds across a wider geographic base and at pricing levels considered attractive  where the underlying depositor may be retail or institutional

like the industry in general  there were many factors that presented a challenge to the net interest margin in some of these factors included tightening loan spreads  the movement of new and existing deposits into higher yielding products  loan growth that exceeded the corporation s ability to generate lower cost deposits and an interest rate environment characterized by an inverted yield curve 
management continues to believe that slight margin contraction is more likely than margin expansion 
as a result  the net interest margin fte as a percent of average earning assets could continue to have modest downward pressure  a few basis points per quarter  in the near term 
net interest income and the net interest margin percentage can vary and continue to be influenced by loan and deposit growth  product spreads  pricing competition in the corporation s markets  prepayment activity  future interest rate changes and various other factors

table of contents nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming loans and leases and other real estate owned oreo 
the amount of nonperforming assets is affected by acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities  including the nonperforming assets  of the acquired entities are included in the corporation s consolidated balance sheets from the date the business combination is completed  which impacts period to period comparisons 
oreo is principally comprised of commercial and residential properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans and amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
approximately million or of the increase at december  compared to december  is attributable to construction and land development and residential real estate properties acquired in partial or total satisfaction of problem loans 
nonperforming loans and leases consist of nonaccrual  renegotiated or restructured loans  and loans and leases that are delinquent days or more and still accruing interest 
the balance of nonperforming loans and leases are affected by acquisitions and may be subject to fluctuation based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals 
generally  loans that are days or more past due as to interest or principal are placed on nonaccrual 
exceptions to this rule are generally only for loans fully collateralized by readily marketable securities or other relatively risk free collateral 
in addition  a loan may be placed on nonaccrual when management makes a determination that the facts and circumstances warrant such classification irrespective of the current payment status 
maintaining nonperforming assets at an acceptable level is important to the ongoing success of a financial services institution 
the corporation s comprehensive credit review and approval process is critical to ensuring that the amount of nonperforming assets on a long term basis is minimized within the overall framework of acceptable levels of credit risk 
in addition to the negative impact on net interest income and credit losses  nonperforming assets also increase operating costs due to the expense associated with collection efforts 
at december   nonperforming loans and leases amounted to million or of consolidated loans and leases compared to million or at december  and million or at december  nonperforming loans associated with the banking acquisitions amounted to million or approximately of total nonperforming loans at december  nonaccrual loans and leases increased million at year end compared to year end the net increase was primarily due to increases in all types of nonaccrual real estate loans 
delinquency can be an indicator of potential problem loans and leases 
at december   loans and leases past due days and still accruing interest amounted to million or of total loans and leases outstanding compared to million or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  and million or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  approximately of the increase in loans and leases past due days at december  compared to december  was attributable to all types of real estate loans 
in addition to its nonperforming loans and leases  the corporation has loans and leases for which payments are presently current  but which management believes could possibly be classified as nonperforming in the near future 
these loans are subject to constant management attention and their classification is reviewed on an ongoing basis 
at december   such loans amounted to million or of total loans and leases outstanding compared to million or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  and million of total loans and leases outstanding at december  the increase in nonperforming assets and past due loans and leases reflects the effects of the recent slowdown in the housing market 
this housing related stress has been experienced in all of the corporation s markets and includes both core and acquired loans 
the corporation believes that its risk at the individual loan level remains relatively modest 
the corporation has been very aggressive to isolate  identify and assess its underlying loan and lease portfolio credit quality and has developed strategies to work through this housing related stress 

table of contents net charge offs amounted to million or of average loans and leases in compared with million or of average loans and leases in and million or of average loans and leases in net charge offs in continued to be below the corporation s five year historical average of net charge offs 
the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases to some extent reflects a higher than normal level of recoveries 
however  the ratio of recoveries to charge offs in trended closer to average historical experience 
although positive resolutions continue to be achieved on prior charge offs  recoveries are expected to continue to trend downwards 
management expects net charge offs to be more in the range of to and nonperforming loans and leases as a percent of total loans and leases to range from current levels to 
negative economic events  an adverse development in industry segments within the portfolio or deterioration of a large loan or lease could also have significant adverse impacts on the actual loss levels 
consistent with the credit quality trends noted above  the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million in by comparison  the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
the provisions for loan and lease losses are the amounts required to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the required level after considering charge offs and recoveries 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total loans and leases was at december  compared to at december  and at december  other income total other income amounted to  million in compared to  million in  an increase of million or 
as previously discussed  total other income in includes a loss of million from applying fair value accounting versus hedge accounting to interest rate swaps associated with transactions that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
excluding that loss  total other income amounted to  million in compared to  million in  an increase of million or 
data processing services revenue and wealth management revenue were the primary contributors to the growth in other income in compared to that growth was offset by lower investment securities gains in compared to the prior year 
total data processing services external revenue metavante amounted to  million in compared to  million in  an increase of million or 
revenue growth continued throughout this segment driven by revenue associated with acquisitions  higher transaction volumes in core processing activity  payment processing and electronic banking and an increase in healthcare eligibility and payment card production 
revenue associated with the two acquisitions completed in and a full year of revenue from the six acquisitions completed in contributed a significant portion of the revenue growth in compared to the acquisition related revenue growth includes cross sales of acquired products to customers across the entire segment 
metavante estimates that total revenue growth internal and external for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  excluding the acquisitions organic revenue growth  was approximately 
to determine the estimated organic growth rate  metavante adjusts its prior year revenue for the acquisitions as if they had been consummated on january of the prior year 
total buyout revenue  which varies from period to period  increased million in compared to management expects metavante s total revenue internal and external in to be in the range of billion to billion with margins maintained at levels similar to those achieved in in any given year there is some customer attrition due to banking consolidations 
in addition  due to the focus of some of the acquired companies on software sales and the retail marketplace  revenue tends to be more cyclical and seasonal in nature especially in the fourth quarter 
management expects these trends to continue 
wealth management revenue was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or

no sales occurred in the aggregate gross proceeds available for future sales were approximately million at december  during the third quarter of  the corporation and m i capital trust b issued  units of common spaces sm 
each unit has a stated value of for an aggregate value of million 
each common spaces consists of i a stock purchase contract under which the investor agrees to purchase for  a fraction of a share of the corporation s common stock on the stock purchase date and ii a  or  undivided beneficial interest in a preferred security of m i capital trust b  also referred to as the stacks sm  with each share having an initial liquidation amount of  the stock purchase date is expected to be august   but could be deferred for quarterly periods until august  each stock purchase contract underlying a common spaces obligates the investor to purchase on the stock purchase date for an amount in cash equal to the stated amount of the common spaces  a number of shares of common stock equal to the settlement rate

the most recent quarterly dividend declared by the corporation was per share 
no adjustment to the fixed settlement rate will be made if the applicable market value of common stock is in the to range 
the corporation estimates that it will issue approximately million to million common shares to settle shares issuable pursuant to the stock purchase contracts 
before issuance of the common shares upon settlement of the stock purchase contracts  the stock purchase contracts will be reflected in diluted earnings per share calculations using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  the corporation expects there will be some dilutive effect on earnings per share for periods when the average market price of the corporation s

there was no dilutive effect on diluted earnings per share for the years ended december   and federal and state banking laws place certain restrictions on the amount of dividends and loans which a bank may make to its parent company 
such restrictions have not had  and are not expected to have  any material effect on the corporation s ability to meet its cash obligations 
m i manages its liquidity to ensure that funds are available to each of its banks to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers and to ensure the corporation s own cash requirements are met 
m i maintains liquidity by obtaining funds from several sources 
the corporation s most readily available source of liquidity is its investment portfolio 
investment securities available for sale  which totaled billion at december   represent a highly accessible source of liquidity 
the corporation s portfolio of held to maturity investment securities  which totaled billion at december   provides liquidity from maturities and interest payments 
the corporation s loans held for sale provide additional liquidity 
these loans represent recently funded loans that are prepared for delivery to investors  which generally occurs within thirty to ninety days after the loan has been funded 
depositors within m i s defined markets are another source of liquidity 
core deposits demand  savings  money market and consumer time deposits averaged billion in the corporation s banking affiliates may also access the federal funds markets or utilize collateralized borrowings such as treasury demand notes or fhlb advances 
the banking affiliates may use wholesale deposits  which include foreign eurodollar deposits 
wholesale deposits  which averaged billion in  are funds in the form of deposits generated through distribution channels other than the corporation s own banking branches 
these deposits allow the corporation s banking subsidiaries to gather funds across a national geographic base and at pricing levels considered attractive  where the underlying depositor may be retail or institutional 
access to wholesale deposits also provides the corporation with the flexibility to not pursue single service time deposit relationships in markets that have experienced some unprofitable pricing levels 
the corporation utilizes certain financing arrangements to meet its balance sheet management  funding  liquidity  and market or credit risk management needs 
the majority of these activities are basic term or revolving securitization vehicles 
these vehicles are generally funded through term amortizing debt structures or with short term commercial paper designed to be paid off based on the underlying cash flows of the assets securitized 
these facilities provide access to funding sources substantially separate from the general credit risk of the corporation and its subsidiaries 
the corporation s lead bank  m i marshall ilsley bank m i bank has implemented a bank note program 
during  m i bank amended the bank note program into a global bank note program that permits it to issue up and sell up to a maximum of us billion aggregate principal amount or the equivalent thereof in other currencies at any one time outstanding of its senior global bank notes with maturities of seven days or more from their respective date of issue and subordinated global bank notes with maturities more than five years from their respective date of issue 
the notes may be fixed rate or floating rate and the exact terms will be specified in the applicable pricing supplement or the applicable program supplement 
this program is intended to enhance liquidity by enabling m i bank to sell its debt instruments in global markets in the future without the delays that would otherwise be incurred 
bank notes outstanding at december   amounted to billion of which billion is subordinated and qualifies as supplementary capital for regulatory capital purposes 
the national capital markets represent a further source of liquidity to the corporation 
the corporation has filed a number of shelf registration statements that are intended to permit the corporation to raise funds through sales of corporate debt and or equity securities with a relatively short lead time 

table of contents during the third quarter of  the corporation amended the shelf registration statement originally filed with the securities and exchange commission during the second quarter of to include the equity distribution agreement previously discussed

at december   approximately billion was available for future securities issuances 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission which will enable the corporation to issue up to million shares of its common stock which may be offered and issued from time to time in connection with acquisitions by m i  metavante and or other subsidiaries of the corporation

as such  interest charges on certificate of deposit and other time deposit obligations and short term debt obligations 
table of contents were excluded from amounts reported  as the potential cash outflows would have corresponding cash inflows from interest bearing assets 
the same  although to a lesser extent  is the case with respect to interest charges on long term debt obligations 
as long term debt obligations may be used for purposes other than to fund interest bearing assets  an estimate of interest charges is included in the amounts reported 
certain retail certificates of deposit and other time deposits give customers rights to early withdrawal 
early withdrawals may be subject to penalties 
the penalty amount depends on the remaining time to maturity at the time of early withdrawal 
brokered certificates of deposits may be redeemed early upon the death or adjudication of incompetence of the holder 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s various short term borrowings 
many short term borrowings such as federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements and commercial paper are expected to be reissued and  therefore  do not necessarily represent an immediate need for cash 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s various long term borrowings 
the amounts shown in the table include interest on both fixed and variable rate obligations 
the interest associated with variable rate obligations is based upon rates in effect at december  the contractual amounts to be paid on variable rate obligations are affected by changes in market interest rates 
future changes in market interest rates could materially affect the contractual amounts to be paid 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s foreign exchange activities 
the corporation generally matches commitments to deliver foreign currencies with obligations to purchase foreign currencies which minimizes the immediate need for cash 
the corporation also has unfunded obligations for certain investments in investment funds 
under the obligations for certain investments in investment funds the corporation could be required to invest an additional million if the investment funds identify and commit to invest in additional qualifying investments 
the investment funds have limited lives and defined periods for investing in new qualifying investments or providing additional funds to existing investments 
as a result  the timing and amount of the funding requirements for these obligations are uncertain and could expire with no additional funding requirements 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the corporation s defined contribution program 
the amount shown represents the unfunded contribution for the year ended december  the health and welfare benefit plans are periodically funded throughout each plan year with participant contributions and the corporation s portion of benefits expected to be paid 
the corporation has generally financed its growth through the retention of earnings and the issuance of debt 
it is expected that future growth can be financed through internal earnings retention  additional debt offerings  or the issuance of additional common or preferred stock or other capital instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements the term off balance sheet arrangement describes the means through which companies typically structure off balance sheet transactions or otherwise incur risks of loss that are not fully transparent to investors or other users of financial information 
for example  in many cases  in order to facilitate transfer of assets or otherwise finance the activities of an unconsolidated entity  a company may be required to provide financial support designed to reduce the risks to the entity or other third parties 
that financial support may take many different forms such as financial guarantees  subordinated retained interests  derivative instruments or other contingent arrangements that expose the company to continuing risks or contingent liabilities regardless of whether or not they are recorded on the balance sheet 

table of contents certain guarantees may be a source of potential risk to future liquidity  capital resources and results of operations 
guarantees may be in the form of contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument or variable such as a financial standby letter of credit  failure to perform under an obligating agreement such as a performance standby letter of credit  and indemnification agreements that require the indemnifying party to make payments to the indemnified party based on changes in an underlying instrument or variable that is related to an asset  a liability or an equity security of the indemnified party  such as an adverse judgment in a lawsuit 
the corporation  for a fee  regularly enters into standby letters of credit transactions and provides certain indemnifications against loss in conjunction with software sales  merchant credit card processing and securities lending activities  which are described in detail in notes and in notes to consolidated financial statements 
companies may structure and facilitate off balance sheet arrangements by retaining an interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity 
such interests may be in the form of a subordinated retained interest in a pool of receivables transferred to an unconsolidated entity  cash collateral accounts  recourse obligations or other forms of credit  liquidity  or market risk support 
these subordinated interests protect the senior interests in the unconsolidated entity in the event a portion of the underlying transferred assets becomes uncollectible or there are insufficient funds to repay senior interest obligations 
the corporation uses such arrangements primarily in conjunction with its indirect automobile lending activities that are described in detail in note in notes to consolidated financial statements and in the discussion of critical accounting policies that follows this discussion 
as described in note in notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation holds all of the common interest in m i capital trust a and m i capital trust b which issued cumulative preferred capital securities which are supported by junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures and a full guarantee issued by the corporation 
in conjunction with the banking acquisitions completed in  the corporation acquired all of the common interests in an additional four trusts that also issued cumulative preferred capital securities which are supported by junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures in the aggregate principal amounts of million  million  million and million  respectively and full guarantees assumed by the corporation 
the corporation does not consolidate any of these six trusts in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
at december   the corporation did not hold any material variable interests in entities that provide it liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with the corporation 
based on the off balance sheet arrangements with which it is presently involved  the corporation does not believe that such off balance sheet arrangements either have  or are reasonably likely to have  a material impact to its current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital 
critical accounting policies the corporation has established various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the corporation are described in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein and updated as necessary in its quarterly reports on form q 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of the operations of the corporation 
management continues to consider the following to be those accounting policies that require significant judgments and assumptions allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the corporation s loan and lease portfolio 
management evaluates the allowance each quarter to determine that it is adequate to absorb these inherent losses 
this evaluation is supported by a methodology that identifies estimated losses based on assessments of individual problem loans and historical loss patterns of homogeneous loan pools 
in addition  environmental factors  including economic conditions and regulatory guidance  unique to each measurement date are also considered 
this reserving methodology has the following components 
table of contents specific reserve 
the corporation s internal risk rating system is used to identify loans and leases that meet the criteria as being impaired under the definition in sfas a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
for impaired loans  impairment is measured using one of three alternatives the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  if available  or the fair value of the collateral for collateral dependent loans and loans for which foreclosure is deemed to be probable 
in general  these loans have been internally identified as credits requiring management s attention due to underlying problems in the borrower s business or collateral concerns 
subject to a minimum size  a quarterly review of these loans is performed to identify the specific reserve necessary to be allocated to each of these loans 
this analysis considers expected future cash flows  the value of collateral and also other factors that may impact the borrower s ability to make payments when due 
collective loan impairment 
this component of the allowance for loan and lease losses is comprised of two elements 
first  the corporation makes a significant number of loans and leases  which due to their underlying similar characteristics  are assessed for loss as homogeneous pools 
included in the homogeneous pools are loans and leases from the retail sector and commercial loans under a certain size that have been excluded from the specific reserve allocation previously discussed 
the corporation segments the pools by type of loan or lease and  using historical loss information  estimates a loss reserve for each pool 
the second element reflects management s recognition of the uncertainty and imprecision underlying the process of estimating losses 
the internal risk rating system is used to identify those loans within certain industry segments that based on financial  payment or collateral performance  warrant closer ongoing monitoring by management 
the specific loans mentioned earlier are excluded from this analysis 
based on management s judgment  reserve ranges are allocated to industry segments due to environmental conditions unique to the measurement period 
consideration is given to both internal and external environmental factors such as economic conditions in certain geographic or industry segments of the portfolio  economic trends  risk profile  and portfolio composition 
reserve ranges are then allocated using estimates of loss exposure that management has identified based on these economic trends or conditions 
the corporation has not materially changed any aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
there have been no material changes in estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance 
however  on an on going basis the corporation continues to refine the methods used in determining management s best estimate of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the following factors were taken into consideration in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses at december  the recent slowdown in the housing market is having an impact on the performance of some of the corporation s construction and land development loans 
a re balancing of supply and demand within the national housing market has reduced both absorption rates and valuations causing stress for some borrowers within this loan segment 
these loans are geographically dispersed and are in both the corporation s core and acquired loan portfolios 
the corporation has taken these exposures into consideration in determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan and lease losses 
at december   allowances for loan and lease losses continue to be carried for exposures to manufacturing  healthcare  production agriculture including dairy and cropping operations  truck transportation  accommodation  general contracting  motor vehicle and parts dealers and construction and land development loans secured by vacant land 
the majority of the commercial charge offs incurred in recent periods were in these industry segments 
while most loans in these categories are still performing  the corporation continues to believe these sectors present a higher than normal risk due to their financial and external characteristics 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of  the corporation s commitments to shared national credits were approximately billion with usage averaging around 
many of the corporation s largest charge offs have come from the shared national credit portfolio 
although these factors result in an increased risk profile  as of december   there were no shared national credit nonperforming loans 
the corporation s exposure to shared national credits is monitored closely given this lending group s loss experience 
the corporation s primary lending areas are wisconsin  arizona  minnesota and missouri 
the vast majority of the assets acquired from gold banc are in entirely new markets for the corporation 
included in these new markets is the kansas city metropolitan area  tulsa  oklahoma  and tampa  sarasota and bradenton  florida 
each of these regions and markets has cultural and environmental factors that are unique to them 
at december   nonperforming loans and leases amounted to million or of consolidated loans and leases compared to million or at december  and million or at december  nonperforming loans associated with the banking acquisitions amounted to million or approximately of total nonperforming loans at december  nonaccrual loans and leases increased million at year end compared to year end the net increase was primarily due to increases in all types of nonaccrual real estate loans 
net charge offs amounted to million or of average loans and leases in compared with million or of average loans and leases in and million or of average loans and leases in the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases to some extent reflects a higher than normal level of recoveries 
however  the ratio of recoveries to charge offs in trended closer to average historical experience 
although positive resolutions continue to be achieved on prior charge offs  recoveries are expected to continue to trend downwards 
management expects net charge offs to be more in the range of to 
based on the above loss estimates  management determined its best estimate of the required allowance for loans and leases 
management s evaluation of the factors described above resulted in an allowance for loan and lease losses of million or of loans and leases outstanding at december  the allowance for loan and lease losses was million or of loans and leases outstanding at december  consistent with the credit quality trends noted above  the provision for loan and lease losses amounted to million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the resulting provisions for loan and lease losses are the amounts required to establish the allowance for loan and lease losses at the required level after considering charge offs and recoveries 
management recognizes there are significant estimates in the process and the ultimate losses could be significantly different from those currently estimated 
capitalized software and conversion costs direct costs associated with the production of computer software that will be licensed externally or used in a service bureau environment are capitalized 
capitalization of such costs is subject to strict accounting policy criteria  although the appropriate time to initiate capitalization requires management judgment 
once the specific capitalized project is put into production  the software cost is amortized over its estimated useful life  generally four years 
each quarter  the corporation performs net realizable value tests to ensure the assets are recoverable 
such tests require management judgment as to the future sales and profitability of a particular product which involves  in some cases  multi year projections 
technology changes and changes in customer requirements can have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and can be difficult to predict 
should significant adverse changes occur  estimates of useful life may have to be revised or write offs would be required to recognize impairment 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of software costs capitalized amounted to million and million  respectively 
amortization expense of software costs amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  metavante determined that certain products had limited growth potential 
as a result of strategic product reviews and the results of net realizable tests on these products  metavante determined that the capitalized software and other assets associated with the products were impaired 
total capitalized software costs written off amounted to million and are included in other noninterest expense in 
table of contents direct costs associated with customer system conversions to the data processing operations are capitalized and amortized on a straight line basis over the terms  generally five to seven years  of the related servicing contracts 
capitalization only occurs when management is satisfied that such costs are recoverable through future operations or buyout fees in case of early termination 
for the years ended december  and  the amount of conversion costs capitalized amounted to million and million  respectively 
amortization expense of conversion costs amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net unamortized costs  which are included in accrued interest and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets  at december  were in millions software conversions total the corporation has not substantively changed any aspect to its overall approach in the determination of the amount of costs that are capitalized for software development or conversion activities 
there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the periodic amortization of such costs 
financial asset sales and securitizations the corporation utilizes certain financing arrangements to meet its balance sheet management  funding  liquidity  and market or credit risk management needs 
the majority of these activities are basic term or revolving securitization vehicles 
these vehicles are generally funded through term amortizing debt structures or with short term commercial paper designed to be paid off based on the underlying cash flows of the assets securitized 
these financing entities are contractually limited to a narrow range of activities that facilitate the transfer of or access to various types of assets or financial instruments 
in certain situations  the corporation provides liquidity and or loss protection agreements 
in determining whether the financing entity should be consolidated  the corporation considers whether the entity is a qualifying special purpose entity qspe as defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
for non consolidation  a qspe must be demonstrably distinct  have significantly limited permitted activities  hold assets that are restricted to transferred financial assets and related assets  and can sell or dispose of non cash financial assets only in response to specified conditions 
in december  the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities revised december 
this interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
transferors to qspes and grandfathered qspes subject to the reporting requirements of sfas are outside the scope of fin r and do not consolidate those entities 
with respect to the corporation s securitization activities  the adoption of fin r did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements because its transfers are generally to qspes 
the corporation sells financial assets in a two step process that results in a surrender of control over the assets  as evidenced by true sale opinions from legal counsel  to unconsolidated entities that securitize the assets 
the corporation retains interests in the securitized assets in the form of interest only strips and cash reserve accounts 
gain or loss on sale of the assets depends in part on the carrying amount assigned to the assets sold allocated between the asset sold and retained interests based on their relative fair values at the date of transfer 
the value of the retained interests is based on the present value of expected cash flows estimated using management s best estimates of the key assumptions credit losses  prepayment speeds  forward yield curves and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
actual results can differ from expected results 
the corporation reviews the carrying values of the retained interests monthly to determine if there is a decline in value that is other than temporary and periodically reviews the propriety of the assumptions used based on current historical experience as well as the sensitivities of the carrying value of the retained interests to adverse changes in the key assumptions 
the corporation believes that its estimates result in a reasonable carrying value of the retained interests 

table of contents net gains associated with the retained interests  held in the form of interest only strips amounted to million in compared to million in and are included in net investment securities gains in the consolidated statements of income 
during  the corporation realized million in gains that were offset by impairment losses of million 
there were no impairment losses in the gains realized in and resulted from the excess of cash received over the carrying amount of certain interest only strips 
the impairment in was a result of the differences between the actual credit losses experienced compared to the expected credit losses used in measuring certain interest only strips 
those impairments were deemed to be other than temporary 
the corporation regularly sells automobile loans to an unconsolidated multi seller special purpose entity commercial paper conduit in securitization transactions in which servicing responsibilities and subordinated interests are retained 
the outstanding balances of automobile loans sold in these securitization transactions were million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  the carrying amount of retained interests amounted to million and million  respectively 
the corporation also sells  from time to time  debt securities classified as available for sale that are highly rated to an unconsolidated bankruptcy remote qspe whose activities are limited to issuing highly rated asset backed commercial paper with maturities up to days which is used to finance the purchase of the investment securities 
the corporation provides liquidity back up in the form of liquidity purchase agreements 
in addition  the corporation acts as counterparty to interest rate swaps that enable the qspe to hedge its interest rate risk 
such swaps are designated as free standing derivative financial instruments in the corporation s consolidated balance sheet 
at december   highly rated investment securities in the amount of million were outstanding in the qspe to support the outstanding commercial paper 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the income statement in the period that includes the enactment date 
the determination of current and deferred income taxes is based on complex analyses of many factors  including interpretation of federal and state income tax laws  the difference between tax and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences  estimates of amounts currently due or owed  such as the timing of reversals of temporary differences and current accounting standards 
the federal and state taxing authorities who make assessments based on their determination of tax laws periodically review the corporation s interpretation of federal and state income tax laws 
tax liabilities could differ significantly from the estimates and interpretations used in determining the current and deferred income tax liabilities based on the completion of taxing authority examinations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin were effective beginning january  the financial statement impact of adopting fin was not material 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements a discussion of new accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the corporation and have been or will be adopted by the corporation is included in note in notes to consolidated financial statements in item 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk arises from exposure to changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices  and other relevant market rate or price risk 
the corporation faces market risk through trading and other than trading activities 
while market risk that arises from trading activities in the form of foreign exchange and interest rate risk is immaterial to the corporation  market risk from other than trading activities in the form of interest rate risk is measured and managed through a number of methods 
interest rate risk the corporation uses financial modeling techniques to identify potential changes in income under a variety of possible interest rate scenarios 
financial institutions  by their nature  bear interest rate and liquidity risk as a necessary part of the business of managing financial assets and liabilities 
the corporation has designed strategies to limit these risks within prudent parameters and identify appropriate risk reward tradeoffs in the financial structure of the balance sheet 
the financial models identify the specific cash flows  repricing timing and embedded option characteristics of the assets and liabilities held by the corporation 
policies are in place to assure that neither earnings nor fair value at risk exceed appropriate limits 
the use of a limited array of derivative financial instruments has allowed the corporation to achieve the desired balance sheet repricing structure while simultaneously meeting the desired objectives of both its borrowing and depositing customers 
the models used include measures of the expected repricing characteristics of administered rate now  savings and money market accounts and non rate related products demand deposit accounts  other assets and other liabilities 
these measures recognize the relative insensitivity of these accounts to changes in market interest rates  as demonstrated through current and historical experiences 
in addition to contractual payment information for most other assets and liabilities  the models also include estimates of expected prepayment characteristics for those items that are likely to materially change their payment structures in different rate environments  including residential mortgage products  certain commercial and commercial real estate loans and certain mortgage related securities 
estimates for these sensitivities are based on industry assessments and are substantially driven by the differential between the contractual coupon of the item and current market rates for similar products 
this information is incorporated into a model that allows the projection of future income levels in several different interest rate environments 
earnings at risk are calculated by modeling income in an environment where rates remain constant  and comparing this result to income in a different rate environment  and then dividing this difference by the corporation s budgeted operating income before taxes for the calendar year 
since future interest rate moves are difficult to predict  the following table presents two potential scenarios a gradual increase of bp across the entire yield curve over the course of the year bp per quarter  and a gradual decrease of bp across the entire yield curve over the course of the year bp per quarter for the balance sheet as of december  hypothetical change in interest rates impact to pretax income basis point gradual rise in rates basis point gradual decline in rates these results are based solely on the modeled parallel changes in market rates  and do not reflect the earnings sensitivity that may arise from other factors such as changes in the shape of the yield curve and changes in spread between key market rates 
these results also do not include any management action to mitigate potential income variances within the simulation process 
such action could potentially include  but would not be limited to  adjustments to the repricing characteristics of any on or off balance sheet item with regard to short term rate projections and current market value assessments 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 

table of contents another component of interest rate risk is measuring the fair value at risk for a given change in market interest rates 
the corporation also uses computer modeling techniques to determine the present value of all asset and liability cash flows both on and off balance sheet  adjusted for prepayment expectations  using a market discount rate 
the net change in the present value of the asset and liability cash flows in different market rate environments is the amount of fair value at risk from those rate movements 
as of december  the fair value of equity at risk for a gradual bp shift in rates was less than of the market value of the corporation 
equity risk in addition to interest rate risk  the corporation incurs market risk in the form of equity risk 
the corporation invests directly and indirectly through investment funds  in private medium sized companies to help establish new businesses or recapitalize existing ones 
these investments expose the corporation to the change in equity values for the companies of the portfolio companies 
however  fair values are difficult to determine until an actual sale or liquidation transaction actually occurs 
at december   the carrying value of total active capital markets investments amounted to approximately million 
at december   m i wealth management administered billion in assets and directly managed billion in assets 
exposure exists to changes in equity values due to the fact that fee income is partially based on equity balances 
quantification of this exposure is difficult due to the number of other variables affecting fee income 
interest rate changes can also have an effect on fee income for the above stated reasons
