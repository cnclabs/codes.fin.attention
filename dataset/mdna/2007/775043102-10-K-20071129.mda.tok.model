currency translation decreased net income by million of fiscal year net income 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity at september   were cash and cash equivalents of million  short term investments of million  an annually renewable million line of credit with deutsche bank ag  and several other lines of credit to support foreign subsidiaries in their local currencies in an aggregate amount of million translated at the applicable exchange rate at september  
as of september   million was outstanding under the deutsche bank facility and million under other lines of credit 
therefore  million is unused and available under rofin s lines of credit 
the company is subject to financial covenants under this facility and these lines of credit  which could restrict the company from drawing money under them 
at september   the company was in compliance with these covenants 
cash and cash equivalents increased by million during fiscal year approximately million in cash and cash equivalents were provided by operating activities  primarily as the result of increased net income and other non cash items  principally depreciation and amortization 
operating cash flow was negatively affected by an increase in accounts receivables and in inventories  partially offset by an increase in accrued liabilities and in income taxes payable 
uses of cash for investing activities totaled million for the year ended september   and related primarily to the purchase of short term investments million offset by the sale of short term investments  and various additions to property and equipment in connection with the expansion of the company s operations million 
net cash used by financing activities totaled million and was primarily related to current period repayments of bank debt  net of borrowings of million  offset by million generated through issuance of new shares from the exercise of stock options 
the company expects that its capital expenditures will be approximately million in management believes that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our credit facilities and lines of credit  will provide adequate resources to meet the company s capital requirements and operational needs on both a current and a long term basis 
the following table illustrates the company s contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt   pension obligations     operating lease obligations     purchase obligations    interest obligation    other long term liabilities  total     off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or financing arrangements involving variable interest entities 
currency exchange rate fluctuations although the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in us dollars  approximately of its net sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro  swedish krona  british pound  singapore dollar  taiwanese dollar  korean won  japanese yen  canadian dollar  and chinese rmb 
net sales and costs and related assets and liabilities are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the operations  thereby serving to reduce the company s exposure to exchange gains and losses 
exchange differences upon translation from each operation s functional currency to us dollars are accumulated as a separate component of equity 
the currency translation adjustment component of shareholders equity had the effect of increasing total equity by million at september   as compared to million at september  the fluctuation of the euro and the other relevant functional currencies against the us dollar has had the effect of increasing or decreasing as applicable reported net sales  as well as cost of goods sold  gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses  and research and development expenses  denominated in such foreign currencies when translated into us dollars as compared to prior periods 
the following table illustrates the effect of the changes in exchange rates on the company s fiscal   and  net sales  gross profit  and income from operations fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year at at at exchange exchange exchange actual rates actual rates actual rates in millions net sales gross profit income from operations between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
this strengthening of the euro had the effect of increasing operating expense by million  thereby increasing income from operations only by million 
between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro weakened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this weakening was to decrease net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales were denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
this weakening of the euro had the effect of decreasing operating expense by million  thereby reducing income from operations only by million 
between fiscal year and  the average exchange rate for the euro strengthened against the us dollar by approximately 
the impact of this strengthening was to increase net sales and gross profit by million and million  respectively  because approximately of sales are denominated in other currencies  primarily the euro 
however  because more than of operating expenses are also denominated in these other currencies  this same strengthening of the euro had the effect of increasing operating expenses and thereby reducing the overall exchange rate effect on income from operations by million 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for uncollectible customer accounts receivable based on historical experience 
additionally  an allowance is made based on an assessment of specific customers financial condition and liquidity 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
no individual customer represents more than of total accounts receivable 
any increase in allowance will impact operating income during a given period 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  after provisions for excess and obsolete inventory salable at prices below cost 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on current assessments about historical experience and future product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these factors are impacted by market conditions  technology changes  and changes in strategic direction  and require estimates and management judgment that may include elements that are uncertain 
the company evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
although the company strives to achieve a balance between market demands and risk of inventory excess or obsolescence  it is possible that  should conditions change  additional provisions may be needed 
any changes in provisions will impact operating income during a given period 
warranty reserves the company provides reserves for the estimated costs of product warranties when revenue is recognized 
the company relies upon historical experience  expectation of future conditions  and its service data to estimate its warranty reserve 
the company continuously monitors these data to ensure that the reserve is sufficient 
warranty expense has historically been within our expectations 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims such costs may include material  labor  and travel costs  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
increases in reserves will impact operating income during the period 
pension obligations the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating those amounts 
assumptions are made about interest rates  expected investment return on plan assets  total turnover rates  and rates of future compensation increases 
in addition  the company provides the actuarial consultants with subjective factors such as withdrawal rates and mortality rates to develop their calculations of these amounts 
the company generally reviews these assumptions at the beginning of each fiscal year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
the actuarial assumptions that the company uses may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may result in a significant impact on the amount of pension benefits expense the company has recorded or may record 
the discount rate enables the company to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the company has little latitude in selecting this rate and it must represent the market rate of high quality fixed income investments 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
share based payment stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite vesting period 
we make judgments about the fair value of the awards  including the expected term of the award  volatility of the underlying stock and estimated forfeitures  which impact the amount of compensation expense recognized in the financial statements 
such amounts may change as a result of additional grants  forfeitures  modifications in assumptions and other factors 
sfas no 
r provides that income tax effects of share based payments are recognized in the financial statements for those awards which will normally result in tax deductions under existing tax law 
under current us federal tax laws  we receive a compensation expense deduction related to stock options only when those options are exercised and vested shares are received 
accordingly  the financial statement recognition of compensation cost for stock options creates a deductible temporary difference which results in a deferred tax asset and a corresponding deferred tax benefit in the income statement for all us based employees 
stock compensation expense related to non us employees is treated as a permanent difference for income tax purposes 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions under statement no 
upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact of fin on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
will materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the company is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of september   the company maintained cash equivalents and short term investments of million  consisting mainly of non taxable interest bearing securities and demand deposits all with maturities of less than three months 
if short term interest rates were to increase or decrease by  the impact on interest income would be approximately million 
as of september   the company had million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is reset every three months  million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is reset every six months  million of variable rate debt on which the interest rate is set annually and million of fixed rate debt 
maturities of this debt are as follows million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  million is due in  and  million is due in a change in the variable interest rates of the company s debt would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of less than million 
additionally  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements of total notional amount of euro million equivalent to million based on the exchange rate at september  to minimize the interest expenses on short term debt by shifting from variable to fixed interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts and forward exchange options generally of less than one year duration to hedge a portion of its foreign currency risk on sales transactions 
at september   the company held japanese yen forward exchange options with notional amounts of euro million  japanese yen forward exchange options with notional amount of million  and great britain pound forward exchange options with notional amount of million 
the gains or losses resulting from a change in currency exchange rates would be approximately million
