fiscal compared to fiscal the four month suspension june october from receiving new contract awards from the us government at some of our operations caused disruption in our business in several respects which cannot be easily measured  but certainly had an impact on the results of operations in fiscal both in terms of sales and profitability 
while the effects of the suspension were evident during the first quarter  they continued during the second quarter and to a lesser degree in the third quarter due to delays in bookings 
the fourth quarter was affected by the second suspension on june  but the impact on the fourth quarter performance was not significant 
net sales for the fifty two weeks ended july  were approximately million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease in net sales is partly related to the recording of a million claim receivable on a major program during the first quarter of the prior year 
in addition  there was a net decline of million in microwave systems and assemblies in our domestic operations primarily due to the completion of certain contracts and the timing of shipments  some of which was due to the delays in bookings during the suspension period 
sales of simulation systems at ewst declined million due to the completion of certain contracts and the cyclical nature of its business 
commercial sales of medical products were slightly higher  while commercial sales at herley cti decreased million as certain commercial programs ended and the transition towards military business progressed 
offsetting these decreases were million of increased sales at herley israel of both microwave systems and microwave products 
our level of inter company sales  which are eliminated in consolidation  increased to million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal domestic and foreign sales were and respectively of net sales in fiscal  versus and respectively in fiscal the gross profit margin in the fifty two weeks ended july  was compared to in fiscal  a decline of 
contributing to the reduction in the gross profit percentage during fiscal are the following items o the booking of the million claim receivable in fiscal o disruptions caused by the four month suspension from receiving new contract awards from the u 
s 
government at some of our operations 
o startup production costs on certain programs 
o product mix of contracts domestically and internationally 
offset by o revisions in the accrual for contract losses on existing contracts based on current estimates 
the accrual for contract losses associated with the ici acquisition more fully described in note b of form k for the fiscal year ended july  was reduced by  in the fifty two weeks ended july  which is included as a reduction of costs of products sold as a result of changes in the estimated liability for expected losses under the contract 
selling and administrative expenses for the fifty two weeks ended july  were of net sales as compared to in fiscal the increase in costs as a percentage of sales is due to the lower net sales in fiscal selling and administrative costs declined year to year by  increases and decreases are as follows o stock compensation costs recorded in fiscal per sfas r of million  of which approximately million was related to the recent employment contract for the chief operating officer 
this is an increase of million versus fiscal where the stock compensation costs were million 
offset by o legal costs  net of estimated insurance recoveries  were million in fiscal  a decrease of million versus fiscal the majority of the legal costs relate to the defense of the company associated with the recent indictment 
o a net decrease of approximately million in commission costs across several businesses due to the mix and timing of specific orders 
we believe we are entitled to recovery of certain legal fees associated with the recent indictment and class action complaints under our d o insurance policy 
accordingly  as of july   we have a receivable of  net of a deductible of  and a payment received of  on june  in anticipation of recoveries and the amount is included in other receivables in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at july  the insurance carrier may contest the claim in whole or in part 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement dated january  with the insurance carrier whereby if it is determined by final decision of an arbitration panel  or by final judgment of a court  or other final decision of a tribunal having jurisdiction thereof  that any amount paid by the insurance carrier was not a loss  as that term is defined in the policy  we shall repay to the insurance carrier any such uncovered sums previously advanced to us 
employment contract settlement costs of approximately million relate to an agreement effective october  with the company s co founder and former chairman  to terminate his employment agreement with us after years of service 
settlement costs include a cash payment of million paid upon the effective date of the settlement agreement  payments due under a promissory note and estimated medical and life insurance benefits discounted at an imputed interest rate of  plus the fair value of a modification to the stock options held by him using the black scholes option valuation model 
we had operating income for fiscal of million compared to operating income of million in fiscal excluding the employment contract settlement costs of million recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  operating income for fiscal would have been million or of net sales  as compared to million or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in operating income as a percentage of net sales is primarily attributable to the increase in selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales due to the lower sales volume 
our foreign operations contributed approximately million in operating income for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal investment income was  an increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal because of interest earned on higher cash balances 
interest expense was  an increase of  as compared to the prior year primarily due to the imputed interest expense related to the employment settlement agreement  as well as interest expense relating to financing the implementation of the erp software package 
we recognized a net foreign exchange gain of  in fiscal  versus a gain of  in fiscal these foreign exchange gains are attributable to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency of our uk subsidiary primarily in connection with temporary advances we have made to them in us dollars 
the benefit for income taxes for fiscal was  representing a negative effective tax rate of  as compared to an effective tax rate of in fiscal the decline in the effective income tax rate for fiscal is primarily attributable to a the extension of the r d tax credit by congress in december retroactive to january   b an increase in the proportion of overall earnings generated through the company s foreign operations where earnings are taxed at lower rates than domestically  and c the elimination of certain tax accruals that are no longer deemed necessary 
the extension of the r d tax credit reduced the statutory income tax rate of by an estimated for fiscal as a result of lower domestic earnings  due primarily to the employment contract settlement costs which significantly affects domestic profitability  foreign earnings are a greater percentage of total earnings 
the company s foreign earnings are attributable primarily to our israeli subsidiary which is taxed at an estimated rate of for fiscal thereby reducing the effective income tax rate by approximately 
the elimination of certain tax reserves that are no longer deemed necessary reduced the effective tax rate by approximately 
other benefits included research and development credits prior to december   tax benefits attributable to extra territorial income ie export sales  the section manufacturing deduction  the benefit of stock compensation costs  and tax exempt interest income

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fifty two weeks ended july  were approximately million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of approximately million 
net sales attributable to the acquisitions of msi and ici which were completed in the third quarter of fiscal accounted for an increase of approximately million in net sales 
we also experienced an approximate million net increase in sales at our other operations  most significantly as follows o an increase in sales at our lancaster operation of million  which includes million in revenue in connection with a claim due to customer delays and changes in specifications and designs under a major program  as well as an increase of million in the sales of herley medical products 
these increases were offset by reduced sales caused by a reduction in scheduled requirements of f  iff  amraam and meteor programs 
o a net increase in sales at our herley israel operation of approximately million  primarily driven by an increase in development and production of sophisticated microwave integrated assemblies for military use to various international customers 
our level of inter company sales  which are eliminated in consolidation  increased to million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal the gross profit margin for the fifty two weeks ended july  was as compared to the margin of in fiscal  a decline of 
the decrease in gross profit margins is primarily attributable to the following o development costs on certain contracts in excess of billings to customers

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
it codifies the definitions of fair value included in other authoritative literature  clarifies and  in some cases  expands on the guidance for implementing fair value measurements  and increases the level of disclosure required for fair value measurements 
although sfas applies to and amends the provisions of existing authoritative literature  it does not  of itself  require any new fair value measurements  nor does it establish valuation standards 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  we will evaluate the impact of adopting sfas but do not expect that it will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab which was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab requires registrants to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements using both the rollover method  which focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement  and the iron curtain method  which focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet 
the use of both of these methods is referred to as the dual approach and should be combined with the evaluation of qualitative elements surrounding the errors in accordance with sab no

critical accounting policies and estimates our established policies are outlined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies contained in part ii  item of this form k 
as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of our financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
we generally recognize revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
payments received from customers in advance of products delivered are recorded as customer advance payments until earned 
approximately of our contracts are firm  fixed price contracts  providing for a predetermined fixed price for the products sold  regardless of the costs incurred 
approximately to of revenues over the last three fiscal years were derived from long term  fixed price contracts for which revenues and estimated profits are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs to date bear to total estimated contract costs at completion with related cost of sales recorded as costs are incurred 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the period in which the change is known 
prospective losses on long term contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of costs over the selling price of the remaining units to be delivered and are recorded in the period when first determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the final costs and contract terms 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
goodwill is tested for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
using a fair value approach applied to our single reporting unit 
impairment charges are recognized for amounts where the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
any future impairment of goodwill will be charged to operations 
we amortize the cost of other intangibles over their estimated useful lives 
amortizable intangible assets may also be tested for impairment if indications of impairment exist 
an impairment test based on a single reporting unit was performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal using our current market capitalization  which in an active market for our common stock  we consider a reasonable indication of implied fair value 
based on this initial step in the test for impairment  we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill at july  effective august   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
this standard requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of the options 
the cost is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the options 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation costs includes a compensation cost of stock options granted prior to but not yet vested as of august  based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas and b compensation cost for all options granted subsequent to july  based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the new provisions of sfas r 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
our expected volatility is based upon the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of share based awards is based on observed historical exercise patterns for our employees 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange and changes in interest rates 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
since the acquisitions of general microwave corporation and ewst  we are subject to movements in foreign currency rate changes related to our operations in israel and in the uk the movements in the israeli shekel versus the us dollar have not been significant 
movements in pounds sterling the functional currency at ewst have been more significant 
for the fiscal years  and  ewst accounts for approximately to of our consolidated net sales  based in part on the rate at which ewst s sterling denominated financial statements have been converted into us dollars 
having a portion of our future revenue and income denominated in sterling exposes us to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the us dollar value of future sterling denominated revenue and earnings 
a decline in the average value of sterling in fiscal  for example  would have reduced sales by approximately  and would have increased our consolidated operating income by approximately  due to the reduction in the us dollar value of ewst s sales and operating loss 
the average  high and low foreign currency exchange rates during fiscal year were  and respectively

we have made inter company advances to ewst in the aggregate amount of approximately million at july  that were previously considered long term advances

in october  we entered into an interest rate swap with a bank pursuant to which it exchanged floating rate interest in connection with the bonds discussed in note g of the financial statements on a notional amount of  for a fixed rate of for a ten year period ending october  the notional amount reduces each year in tandem with the annual installments due on the bonds 
the fixing of the interest rate for this period offsets our exposure to the uncertainty of floating interest rates on the bonds  and as such has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
the hedge is deemed to be highly effective and any ineffectiveness will be recognized in interest expense in the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap was a liability of approximately  as of july  there was no material hedge ineffectiveness related to cash flow hedges during the fiscal years presented to be recognized in earnings 
on april   we replaced our existing credit facility with a new million revolving credit loan agreement with two banks on an unsecured basis which may be used for general corporate purposes  including business acquisitions and stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility requires the payment of interest only on a monthly basis and payment of the outstanding principal balance on march  we may elect to borrow with interest based on the bank s prime rate of interest minus or based on libor plus a margin of to 
the applicable incremental margin is based on the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  as those terms are defined in the agreement 
there is a fee of basis points per annum on the unused portion of the credit facility payable quarterly 
stand by letters of credit were outstanding in the amount of approximately million at july  if at any time our backlog of orders falls below million  the bank may obtain a security interest in eligible accounts receivable  as defined  and if the outstanding advances are greater than of eligible receivables  a lien on all inventory 
funded backlog as of july  was approximately million out of a total backlog of approximately million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of july  the table below provides information about our debt that is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
future principal payment cash flows by maturity date as required under the industrial revenue bonds  and corresponding fair value is as follows in thousands caption fiscal year ending bonds
