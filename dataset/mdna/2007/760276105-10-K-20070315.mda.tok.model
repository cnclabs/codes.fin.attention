chautauqua airlines is our platform for flying to seat aircraft  and  as of december   operated aircraft 
shuttle america is our platform for flying seat aircraft and  as of december   operated erj aircraft 
republic airline is our platform for aircraft with more than seats  and  as of december   republic airline operated twenty eight seat erj aircraft 
from to  our available seat miles  or asms  grew at a compounded annual growth rate of 
as of december   our operational fleet consisted of aircraft  including erj  seat and larger regional jets and erj family  seat regional jets 
currently  we have agreed to place into service an additional erj regional jets for us airways through these aircraft are covered by firm orders that we have with embraer 
we have also agreed to place forty four seat regional jets into service for continental between january and july we will transition erj aircraft from our us airways operations and we plan to lease crj regional jets to fulfill the commitment

in addition  in connection with a marketing agreement among delta  continental and northwest airlines  certain of the routes that we fly using delta s and continental s flight designator codes are also flown under northwest s designator code 
our fixed fee agreements have eliminated our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices  fare competition and passenger volumes 
our development of relationships with multiple major airlines has enabled us to reduce our dependence on any single airline  allocate our overhead more efficiently among our partners and reduce the cost of our services to our partners 
in october  us airways which represented of our revenue for the year ended december   emerged from bankruptcy 
united  which represented of our passenger revenues for the year ended december   emerged from bankruptcy on february  delta  which represented of our passenger revenues for the year ended december   is attempting to reorganize its respective businesses under chapter of the bankruptcy code

twenty of the aircraft are erj regional jets that will transition from the company s us airways operations 
the company has firm commitments to lease crj regional jets with lease terms from to months 
as of december   the company had taken delivery of crj regional jets 
all of the aircraft are expected to be placed into service for continental between january and august and will be operated for terms that vary from two years to five years 
under certain conditions continental may extend the term on the aircraft up to five additional years 
in january  the company and frontier entered into an agreement  whereby  republic will operate for frontier seventeen  seat embraer regional jets 
four of the seventeen aircraft are currently in the republic fleet but not allocated to a code share partner and the remaining aircraft will be funded by delivery positions available from embraer 
we expect to fund future capital commitments through internally generated funds  third party aircraft financings  and debt and other financings 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  cash generated from operations and anticipated third party financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
we may need to raise additional funds  however  to fund more rapid expansion  principally the acquisition of additional aircraft  or meet unanticipated working capital requirements 
it is possible that future funding may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
our contractual obligations and commitments at december   include the following in thousands payments due by period less than year years years over years total long term debt including interest operating leases aircraft under firm orders lease obligations for crj aircraft debt or lease financed aircraft under firm orders engines under firm orders total contractual cash obligations we have a long term maintenance agreement with an avionics equipment manufacturer and maintenance provider that has a guaranteed minimum annual flight hour requirement 
the minimum guaranteed amount based on our current operations is million per year through december for the embraer family of regional jets and million per year through december for the embraer regional jets 
we did not record a liability for this guarantee because we did not believe that our aircraft will be utilized below the minimum flight hour requirement during the term of the agreement 
we have a long term maintenance agreement with an aviation equipment manufacturer through april the agreement has a penalty payment provision if more than twenty percent of chautauqua s aircraft are removed from service based on the annual flight activity prior to the date of removal 
we did not record a liability for this penalty provision because we do not believe that more than twenty percent of their aircraft will be removed from service during the term of the agreement 
we have long term maintenance agreements based upon flight activity with engine manufacturers and maintenance providers through october for the embraer erj family of regional jets and through december for the embraer erj regional jets 
we have a long term maintenance agreement for wheels and brakes through june the agreement has an early termination penalty if chautauqua removes the equipment from certain aircraft  sells or leases certain aircraft to a third party or terminates the services prior to expiration of agreement 
the maximum penalty during the year subsequent to december  is million and is reduced every two years thereafter

we have a long term agreement to provide  manage and repair certain spare parts on our crj regional jets through december the agreement has a guaranteed minimum annual flight hour requirement for certain periods of time during the agreement 
total payments under these long term maintenance agreements were million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our commercial commitments at december  include letters of credit totaling million expiring within one year 
cash payments for interest were approximately million in tax payments in were not significant and we are not expecting significant payments in critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
under our fixed fee arrangements with american  delta  us airways  united  continental and frontier  the company receives a fixed fee  as well as reimbursement of specified costs on a gross basis with additional possible incentives from our partners for superior service 
revenues are recognized in the period the service is provided  and we perform an estimate of the profit component based upon the information available at the end of the accounting period 
the reimbursement of specified costs  known as pass through costs  may include aircraft ownership cost  passenger liability and hull insurance  aircraft property taxes  fuel  landing fees and catering 
all revenue recognized under these contracts is presented at the gross amount billed for reimbursement pursuant to emerging issues tax force issue eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under the company s code share agreements  the company is reimbursed an amount per aircraft designed to compensate the company for certain aircraft ownership costs 
in accordance with eitf no 
 determining whether an arrangement contains a lease  the company has concluded that a component of its revenue under the agreement discussed above is rental income  inasmuch as the agreement identifies the right of use of a specific type and number of aircraft over a stated period of time 
the amount deemed to be rental income during fiscal  and was million  million and million  respectively  and has been included in passenger revenue on the company s consolidated statements of income 
aircraft leases 
the company has aircraft that are leased from third parties 
in order to determine the proper classification of a lease as either an operating lease or a capital lease  the company must make certain estimates at the inception of the lease relating to the economic useful life and the fair value of an asset as well as select an appropriate discount rate to be used in discounting future lease payments 
these estimates are utilized by management in making computations as required by existing accounting standards that determine whether the lease is classified as an operating lease or a capital lease 
all of the company s aircraft leases have been classified as operating leases  which results in rental payments being charged to expense over the term of the related leases 
additionally  operating leases are not reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet and accordingly  neither a lease asset nor an obligation for future lease payments is reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is responsible for all other maintenance costs of its aircraft and must meet specified return conditions upon lease expiration for both the airframes and engines 
the company is unable to estimate the liability for these return conditions as of december   because the leases expire beginning in the company will record a liability for these return conditions once the liability is estimable 
impairments to long lived assets 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
we review  at least annually  the estimated useful lives and salvage values for our owned aircraft and spare parts 
aircraft maintenance and repair 
we follow a method of expensing aircraft maintenance and repair costs 
however  maintenance and repairs for engines and airframe components under power by the hour contracts  such as engines  avionics  apus  wheels and brakes  are accrued for as the aircraft are operated  therefore  amounts are expensed based upon actual hours or cycles flown 
warrants 
warrants issued to non employees are accounted for under sfas no 
r  share based payments  and eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  at fair value on the measurement date 
fair value for warrants issued to delta  for which a measurement date has occurred  have been determined based upon the estimated fair value of the equity instrument issued rather than the consideration received because we believe it is more reliably measured 
various option pricing models are available  however  we have used a model that allows continuous compounding of dividends which begins three years after the grant date and the dilutive effects of our initial public offering and the follow on offerings in option pricing models require estimates of dividend yield  a risk free rate commensurate with the warrant term  stock volatility and the expected life of the warrant 
each of these variables has been determined based upon relevant industry market data  our strategic business plan and consultation with appropriate professionals experienced in valuing similar equity instruments 
income taxes 
the company has generated significant net operating losses nols for federal income tax purposes primarily from accelerated depreciation on owned aircraft 
in july  wexford capital llc s ownership percentage of the company was reduced to less than as a result of a follow on offering of our common stock 
as a result of this decrease in ownership  the utilization of nols generated prior to july are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section irc 
the annual limitation is based upon the enterprise value of the company on the irc ownership change date multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
if the utilization of pre july nols becomes uncertain in future years  we will be required to record a valuation allowance for the nols not expected to be utilized 
intangible commuter slots 
the company acquired commuter slots during at the new york laguardia and ronald reagan washington national airports from us airways 
the licensing agreement with the company and us airways for the laguardia commuter slots expired on december   but we maintain a security interest in the laguardia slots if us airways fails to perform under the current licensing agreement 
the estimated useful lives of these commuter slots were determined based upon the period of time cash flows are expected to be generated by the commuter slots and by researching the estimated useful lives of commuter slots or similar intangibles by other airlines 
in addition  an estimated residual value was determined using estimates of the expected fair value of the commuter slots at the end of the expected useful life 
the residual value will be assessed annually for impairment 
the estimated useful lives are also reviewed annually 
reportable segments 
the company s only reportable segment is scheduled transportation of passengers and air freight under code share agreements
