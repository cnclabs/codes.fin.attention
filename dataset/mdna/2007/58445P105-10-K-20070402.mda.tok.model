contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total critical accounting policies management must make certain estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements of the company 
certain of these estimates and assumptions relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements of the company were the most appropriate at that time  although actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different conditions 
note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the company s consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k provides a detailed discussion of the various accounting policies of the company 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical since they require subjective or complex judgments that could potentially affect the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company assesses the carrying value of its accounts receivable based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific client accounts  which includes consideration of the credit worthiness and financial condition of those specific clients 
the company also assesses the carrying value of accounts receivable balances based on other factors  including historical experience with bad debts  client concentrations  the general economic environment  and the aging of such receivables 
the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce its accounts receivable balance to the amount that is reasonably believed to be collectible 
based on the company s estimates  an allowance for doubtful accounts of was established at december   compared to an allowance of at december  a change in the company s assumptions  including the credit worthiness of clients and the default rate on receivables  would result in the company recovering an amount of its accounts receivable that differs from its current carrying value 
such difference  either positive or negative  would be reflected as a component of the company s sg a expense in future periods 
valuation of long lived assets in assessing the carrying value of its property and equipment and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company reviews such assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is determined by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if it is determined that the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
no events or changes in circumstances have occurred that required the company to assess the recoverability of its property and equipment  and therefore the company has not recognized any impairment charges 
a change in the company s business climate in future periods  including an inability to effectively market and sell new service offerings in which significant investments have been made or a general downturn in one of the company s operations  could lead to a required assessment of the recoverability of the company s long lived assets  which may subsequently result in an impairment charge 
valuation of goodwill in assessing the carrying value of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company compared the carrying value of its reporting units to their fair values 
the company is required to test its goodwill for impairment at least annually  and more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change to indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the company s annual testing date is september in accordance with sfas no 
 the company aggregated certain components to arrive at one of its reporting units 
the company estimated the fair value of its reporting units using a discounted cash flow approach 
in estimating the fair value of its reporting units  the company had to make various assumptions  including projections of future revenues based on assumed long term growth rates  estimated costs  and the appropriate discount rates 
the estimates used by the company for long term revenue growth and future costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates  and a variety of external sources  and are developed as part of the company s routine long range planning process 
the carrying value of the company s goodwill was  at september  based on the use of these assumptions in estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  there was no impairment of goodwill as of september   the most recent annual testing date 
a change in the company s assumptions  including lower long term growth rates  higher operating costs  or higher discount rates could cause a change in the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units  and therefore could result in an impairment of goodwill  which would have a significant adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r and elected to use the modified prospective application for the transition upon adoption  which requires compensation expense to be recognized on options granted subsequent to the adoption date as well as on options granted prior to the adoption date for which the requisite service period had not been completed as of december  the company determines the fair value of stock options granted subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
r using a binomial lattice model 
the fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the company must make certain assumptions in determining the fair value of stock options  including the volatility of the company s common stock  the future dividend yield on the company s common stock  and the term over which stock options will remain outstanding  including making assumptions about the future behavior patterns of the holders of stock options in regard to exercising stock options prior to their expiration 
in addition  the company must make certain assumptions regarding the rate at which options will be forfeited to estimate the service period that will be completed by the holders of stock options 
any deviation in the actual volatility of the company s common stock  the actual dividend yield  and the actual early exercise behavior of holders of stock options from that assumed in estimating the fair value of a stock option will not result in a change in the amount of compensation expense recognized by the company  but will result in the actual value realized by the holder of the stock options to be different than the amount of compensation expense recognized 
any deviation in the actual forfeitures of nonvested stock options during the service period from that assumed will result in a change to the amount of compensation expense recognized  either as additional compensation expense or a reversal of previously recognized compensation expense in the period of change 
income taxes in assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets  the company compared the carrying value of its deferred tax assets to the tax effected projections of its taxable income over future periods in which such assets could be realized 
in estimating its future taxable income  the company had to make various assumptions about its future operating performance 
based on the company s projection of future taxable income  which include the effects of recent operating and tax losses  management believed that it was more likely than not that the benefit associated with the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized in future periods 
accordingly  a valuation allowance in the amount of  and  at december  and  respectively  was established to reserve against the carrying value of certain of the company s deferred tax assets 
a change in the company s assumptions  including better or worse operating performance than projected  could result in a change in the amount of deferred tax assets that will be recovered  and therefore could result in a reduction or increase to the valuation allowance established at december  such an adjustment would be reflected as a component of the company s provision for income taxes in the period of the adjustment 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 was issued and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  a two step process is used to evaluate a tax position 
the first step establishes a recognition criterion under which the tax position is recognized if it is more likely than not that it will be sustained upon examination 
the second step establishes a measurement criterion under which the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purposes of a materiality assessment 
sab no 
requires an entity to use both an income statement approach and a balance sheet approach to separately quantify and assess the amount of any misstatements originating in the current period and the cumulative amount of any such misstatements 
the adoption of sab no 
by the company in did not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations
