item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a primarily non asset based provider of transportation services to shippers throughout the united states and in the canadian provinces of ontario and quebec 
we offer flatbed and dry van trucking services  as well as rail truck and steamship truck intermodal and truck brokerage services 
we primarily operate through a contractor network of independent sales agents and owner operators of tractors and trailers 
in return for their services  we pay our agents and owner operators a percentage of the revenue they generate for us 
our owner operators provided us with approximately  tractors and approximately  trailers  which represented substantially all of the tractors and over of the trailers used in our business 
our use of agents and owner operators reduces our need to provide non driver facilities and tractor and trailer fleets 
the primary physical assets we provide to our agents and owner operators include a portion of our trailer fleet  our headquarters facility  our management information systems and our intermodal depot facilities

revenues and expenses operating revenues 
we generate substantially all of our revenues through fees charged to customers for the transportation of freight 
we also derive revenue from fuel surcharges  loading and unloading activities  equipment detention  container storage and other services 
our revenue growth has been primarily driven by increases in the volume of freight shipped 
generally  we are paid by the mile for our services 
the main factors that affect our shipping rates are competition  available truck capacity  and economic market conditions 
we recognize our revenues at the time of delivery to the receiver s location 
purchased transportation 
purchased transportation represents the amount we pay our owner operators or other third party equipment providers to haul freight and includes the amount of fuel surcharges that we pass through to our owner operators 
the amount of the purchased transportation we pay to our owner operators is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of our revenue for each load hauled 
purchased transportation is the largest component of our costs and increases or decreases proportionately with changes in the amount of revenue generated by our owner operators and other third party providers 
we recognize purchased transportation expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 

table of contents commissions expense 
commissions expense represents the amount we pay our agents for generating shipments on our behalf 
the commissions we pay to our agents are generally established through informal oral agreements and are based on a percentage of revenue generated by each load hauled 
traditionally  commissions increase or decrease in proportion to the revenues generated through our agents 
we recognize commission expenses at the time we recognize the associated revenue 
other operating expense 
other operating expenses represent the repair  tires and parts expenses primarily related to the maintenance of company owned leased trailers and lift equipment  and operating taxes and licenses  net of the rental income we receive from leasing our trailers to our owner operators 
we recognize these expenses as they are incurred and the rental income as it is earned 
selling  general and administrative 
employee compensation and benefits historically have accounted for over of our selling  general and administrative expense 
other components of selling  general and administrative expense include customer bad debt allowance  communications and rent expense 
insurance and claims 
insurance and claims expense represents our insurance premiums and the accruals we make for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
our insurance premiums are generally calculated based on the size of our tractor fleet 
our accruals have primarily related to cargo and property damage claims 
we may also make accruals for personal injuries and property damage to third parties  physical damage to our equipment  and workers compensation claims if we experience a claim in excess of our insurance coverage 
to reduce our exposure to non trucking use liability claims claims incurred while the vehicle is being operated without a trailer attached or is being operated with an attached trailer which does not contain or carry any cargo  we require our owner operators to maintain non trucking use liability coverage  which we refer to as deadhead bobtail coverage  of million per occurrence 
our exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party providers who haul freight on our behalf is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
our insurance expense varies primarily based upon the frequency and severity of our accident experience  the market for insurance  our coverage limits and our self insured retention amounts 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense relates primarily to the depreciation of trailers  management information services equipment  buildings and equipment 
on january   we revised the estimated salvage value of our trailers 
previously we estimated that trailers had no salvage value at the end of their useful life of seven years 
however  based on our evaluation of the current market conditions for used trailers  we estimate that our trailers will have a salvage value equal to of their original cost 
as a result  the estimated salvage value for all trailers owned as of january  has been revised to equal of their original cost 
additionally for any trailers acquired after january  we will use an estimated salvage value of of their original costs 
predecessor operations  dividends and spin off our predecessor began operations in when universal am can  ltd 
was formed as an owner operator and agent based truckload carrier hauling general commodities over irregular routes in north america 
prior to december   we conducted our operations through several independent operating subsidiaries  all of which were owned by centra  inc  or centra  a private company wholly owned by matthew t 
moroun and a trust controlled by manuel j 
moroun 
on december   centra completed a corporate reorganization pursuant to which all of our operating subsidiaries became wholly owned subsidiaries of universal truckload services  inc  a newly formed michigan corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of centra 
today  we conduct our operations through eight operating subsidiaries  which operate under the brand names universal am can  mason dixon lines  louisiana transportation  economy transport  mason dixon intermodal  great american lines  crossroad carriers and nyp of michigan  inc on december   our board of directors declared a special dividend of million payable to centra  our sole shareholder on the record date for this dividend 
this dividend has been paid with a portion of our net 
table of contents proceeds from our initial public offering 
additionally  after october   but prior to the date of our initial public offering  we declared and paid cash and in kind dividends with an estimated aggregate value of million 
on december   centra distributed all of our shares held by it to our shareholders  matthew t 
moroun and a trust controlled by manuel j 
moroun  in a spin off transaction 
during  the internal revenue service irs completed an examination of the spin off 
subsequently  on september   we entered into an agreement with the irs and centra whereby the irs determined that the spin off qualified as a tax free distribution for which no gain or loss was recognized by centra or its shareholders for federal income tax purposes under section and related provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
centra and we have identified three principal purposes for the spin off 
first  the spin off was intended to protect us from defending against allegations of joint employer status with respect to other centra subsidiaries that might engage in motor carrier or logistics related activities 
joint employer status is typically alleged in situations involving labor organizing efforts where two or more commonly controlled entities engage in similar activities 
a finding of such status could subject our existing and future operating employees to organizing efforts initiated at other centra subsidiaries engaged in motor carrier or logistics activities 
we believe that by severing centra s voting control over our company  the risk of joint employer status with centra s remaining subsidiaries was reduced 
thus  the spin off enables us to determine our mix of independent contractors  operating employees and business activities free of concern of events involving centra s operating subsidiaries 
second  the employees of certain centra subsidiaries are represented by collective bargaining agreements 
current and upcoming labor negotiations relating to these subsidiaries involve  or are expected to involve  demands that centra enter into neutrality agreements with the labor union representing these employees 
such agreements typically provide that a parent company remain neutral with respect to efforts to organize the employees of any of its operating subsidiaries 
as was the case with the issue of joint employer status described above  being subjected to the terms of any agreement centra may enter into in order to resolve labor issues at its subsidiaries could affect our ability to manage our labor relations issues in accordance with our own best interests 
third  we believe that the spin off  which results in our being an independent company  enhances our attractiveness to investors

we accrue for estimated losses if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we use judgment and evaluate  with the assistance of legal counsel  whether a loss contingency arising from litigation should be disclosed or recorded 
the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain and so typically a loss cannot be reasonably estimated 
accordingly  if the outcome of legal proceedings are different than is anticipated by us  we would have to record a charge for the matter  generally in the full amount at which it was resolved  in the period resolved  negatively impacting our results of operations and financial position for the period 

table of contents critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  operating revenues and operating expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the possible future resolution of the uncertainties increase  those judgments become even more subjective and complex 
in order to provide an understanding about how our management forms its judgments about future events  including the variables and assumptions underlying the estimates  and the sensitivity of those judgments to different circumstances  we have identified our critical accounting policies below 
allowance for uncollectible receivables the allowance for potentially uncollectible receivables is based on a combination of historical data  cash payment trends  specific customer issues  write off trends  general economic conditions and other factors 
management continuously monitors these factors to arrive at the estimate of accounts receivable that may be ultimately uncollectible 
the receivables analyzed include trade receivables  as well as loans and advances made to owner operators 
past due balances over days and over  are reviewed individually for collectibility 
all other balances are reviewed on a pooled basis 
this analysis requires us to make significant estimates 
changes in the facts and circumstances that these estimates are based upon and changes in the general economic environment could result in a material change to the allowance for uncollectible receivables 
these changes include  but are not limited to  deterioration of customers financial position  changes in our relationships with our customers  agents and owner operators and unforeseen issues relating to individual receivables 
insurance and claim costs we maintain auto liability  workers compensation and general liability insurance with licensed insurance carriers 
we are self insured for all cargo and equipment damage claims 
insurance and claims expense represents premiums paid by us and the accruals made for claims within our self insured retention amounts 
a liability is recognized for the estimated cost of all self insured claims including an estimate of incurred but not reported claims based on historical experience and for claims expected to exceed the our policy limits 
in addition  we are responsible for all of the legal expenses related to claims 
as of december   we did not have any reserves for workers compensation or general liability claims 
we do establish reserves for anticipated losses and expenses related to cargo and equipment damage claims and auto liability claims and we will establish reserves relating to general liability claims in the future as appropriate 
the reserves consist of specific reserves for all known claims and an estimate for claims incurred but not reported 
in determining the reserves  we specifically review all known claims and record a liability based upon our best estimate of the amount to be paid 
in making our estimate  we consider the amount and validity of the claim  as well as our past experience with similar claims 
in establishing the reserve for claims incurred but not reported  we consider our past claims history  including the length of time it takes for claims to be reported to us 
based on our past experience  the time between when a claim occurs and when it is reported to us is short 
as a result  we believe that the number of incurred but not reported claims at any given point in time is small 
these reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted to reflect our experience and updated information relating to specific claims 
if we experience claims that are not covered by our insurance or that exceed our estimated claim reserve  it could increase the volatility of our earnings and have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of depreciation and amortization of long lived assets is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we also evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment by analyzing the operating performance and anticipated future cash flows for those assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the need to adjust the carrying value of the underlying assets if the sum of the expected cash flows is less than the carrying value 
our projection of future cash flows  the level of actual cash flows  the methods of estimation used for determining fair values and salvage values can impact impairment 
any changes in management s judgments could result in greater or lesser annual depreciation and amortization expense or impairment charges in the future 
recently issued accounting pronouncements not currently effective in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier adoption encouraged 
this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company has substantially completed its assessment and believes once adopted  there will not be a material impact on the company s financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risk is affected by changes in interest rates

we did not have any interest rate swap agreements as of december  commodity price risk fluctuations in fuel prices can affect our profitability by affecting our ability to retain or recruit owner operators 
our owner operators bear the costs of operating their tractors  including the cost of fuel 
the tractors operated by our owner operators consume large amounts of diesel fuel 
diesel fuel prices fluctuate greatly due to economic  political and other factors beyond our control 
to address fluctuations in fuel prices  we seek to impose fuel surcharges on our customers and pass these surcharges on to our owner operators 
historically  these arrangements have not fully protected our owner operators from fuel price increases 
if costs for fuel escalate significantly it could make it more difficult to attract additional qualified owner operators and retain our current owner operators 
if we lose the services of a significant number of owner operators or are unable to attract additional owner operators  it could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations
