item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are in the business of discovering  developing and commercializing small molecule drugs for the treatment of serious diseases 
we have built a drug discovery capability that integrates biology  chemistry  biophysics  automation and information technologies  with a goal of making the drug discovery process more efficient and productive 
our most advanced drug candidate  telaprevir  is being investigated for the treatment of hepatitis c virus infection in three major phase b clinical trials 
we are investing significant resources to expand our capabilities in clinical development  regulatory affairs  quality control and commercial operations and to build and manage a commercial supply chain in preparation for the phase development and the potential commercial launch of telaprevir 
we also expect to incur significant costs in to manufacture registration batches of telaprevir and build a telaprevir commercial inventory 
we have a number of other drug candidates  including candidates targeting rheumatoid arthritis  cystic fibrosis  bacterial infection  cancer and pain  that are being evaluated in preclinical studies or clinical trials either by us or in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 
our hiv protease inhibitor  fosamprenavir calcium  is being marketed by our collaborator glaxosmithkline plc as lexiva in the united states and telzir in europe 
we currently are concentrating most of our drug development resources on four drug candidates telaprevir  for the treatment of hcv infection  vx  for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases  vx  for the treatment of cystic fibrosis  and vx  for the treatment of bacterial infection 
in  we expect to continue phase b and commence phase clinical trials of telaprevir  commence phase clinical trials of vx and vx and commence a phase clinical trial of vx we have retained the right to commercialize telaprevir in north america and to commercialize vx except for the far east  vx and vx worldwide 
our pipeline also includes several drug candidates that are being developed by our collaborators 
the most advanced of these drug candidates is mk vx  an aurora kinase inhibitor that is being developed by merck co  inc for the treatment of cancer 
we have a number of other drug candidates in development and a broad based discovery effort 
our net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted common share  and we expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
in  we expect that our research and development expenses will be higher than those in  as we continue to incur research and development costs related to telaprevir and our other drug candidates  establish a commercial supply chain and build telaprevir commercial inventory to support markets where we expect to launch telaprevir  if approved  and build our general drug development and commercialization capabilities 
business focus we have elected to diversify our research and development activities across a relatively broad array of investment opportunities  due in part to the high risks associated with the biotechnology and pharmaceutical business 
this diversification strategy requires more significant financial resources than would be required if we pursued a more limited approach 
we are expending significant resources on development and commercialization of the drug candidates for which we currently have principal clinical development responsibility  in those markets where we have commercial rights 
we rely on collaborators to develop and commercialize certain of our other drug candidates either worldwide or in the markets upon which we are not currently focused 
to date  we have relied on pharmaceutical company collaborators to develop and market our drug candidates that have advanced to late stage clinical trials or commercialization 
telaprevir is the first drug candidate for which we expect to perform all activities related to late stage development  drug supply  registration and commercialization in a major market 
we have limited experience in phase clinical development  supply chain management  or pharmaceutical sales and marketing  and we are building those capabilities as we advance telaprevir through clinical development 
even though telaprevir is a phase b drug candidate  we are planning for and investing significant resources now in preparation for phase clinical trials  application for marketing approval  commercial supply and sales and marketing 
our engagement in these resource intensive activities could make it more difficult for us to maintain our portfolio focus  and puts significant investment at risk if we do not obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize telaprevir in north america 
while we attempt to stage our investments in each drug candidate to coincide to some degree with the occurence of risk reducing events associated with the development of that drug candidate  we may not be able through this approach to reduce significantly the overall financial risk associated with our drug development activities 
there is no assurance that our development of telaprevir will lead successfully to regulatory approval  or that obtaining regulatory approval will lead to commercial success 
in the past  we have sought collaborator funding for a significant portion of our research activities  which required that we grant to those collaborators significant rights to develop and commercialize drug candidates generated by that research 
in the future  we expect that we will fund a greater proportion of our research programs than in past years  using internal funds rather than collaborator funds 
we believe that this strategy will ultimately allow us to retain greater development control of  and commercial rights with respect to  those proprietary drug candidates that may meet our strategic internal investment criteria as in effect from time to time 
discovery and development process discovery and development of a new pharmaceutical product is a lengthy and resource intensive process  which may take to years or more 
throughout this entire process  potential drug candidates are subjected to rigorous evaluation  driven in part by stringent regulatory considerations  designed to generate information concerning efficacy  proper dosage levels and a variety of other physical and chemical characteristics that are important in determining whether a drug candidate should be approved for marketing 
the toxicity characteristics and profile of drug candidates at varying dose levels administered for varying periods of time also are monitored and evaluated during the nonclinical and clinical development process 
most chemical compounds that are investigated as potential drug candidates never progress into formal development  and most drug candidates that do advance into formal development never become commercial products 
a drug candidate s failure to progress or advance may be the result of any one or more of a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes including  for example  the lack of sufficient efficacy against the disease target  the lack of acceptable absorption characteristics or other physical properties  difficulties in developing a cost effective manufacturing or formulation methods or the discovery of toxicities or side effects that are unacceptable for the disease indication being treated 
given the uncertainties of the research and development process  it is not possible to predict with confidence which  if any  of our current research and development efforts will result in a marketable pharmaceutical product 
we monitor the results of our discovery research and our nonclinical and clinical trials and frequently evaluate our portfolio investments in light of new data and scientific  business and commercial insights with the objective of balancing risk and potential 
this process can result in relatively abrupt changes in focus and priority as new information becomes available and we gain additional insights into ongoing programs and potential new programs 
clinical development programs our development of telaprevir illustrates our focus on maintaining greater development control of our drug candidates 
we currently are conducting later stage clinical trials of telaprevir and expect to initiate a phase program for of telaprevir in the second half of designing and coordinating large scale clinical trials to determine the efficacy and safety of drug candidates and support the submission of an nda requires significant financial resources  along with extensive technical and regulatory expertise and infrastructure 
we are conducting three major phase b clinical trials of telaprevir 
prove is ongoing in the united states and prove is ongoing in european union  both in treatment na ve patients 
prove has commenced and is being conducted with patients in north america and the european union who did not achieve svr with previous interferon based treatments 
we expect the results from these clinical trials to provide important information supporting the design and initiation of the phase clinical program for telaprevir 
in  we plan to conduct phase clinical trials of vx in patients with ra  a phase clinical trial of vx in patients with cf  and a phase clinical trial of vx each of these programs requires a significant investment of financial and personnel resources  time and expertise by us and or any program collaborators to realize its full clinical and commercial value 
development investment at this stage is subject to the considerable risk that any one or more of these drug candidates will not advance to product registration 
each drug candidate could fail to progress or advance due to a wide range of adverse experimental outcomes  placing our investment in the drug candidate at risk 
while we attempt to stage our investments to mitigate these financial risks  drug discovery and development by its nature is a very risky undertaking and staging of investment is not always possible or desirable 
we expect to continue to evaluate and prioritize investment in our clinical development programs based on the emergence of new clinical and nonclinical data in each program throughout and in subsequent years 
manufacturing and commercialization strategy we have retained manufacturing and commercialization responsibilities for telaprevir in north america 
in  we expect to undertake significant efforts to prepare for the commercial supply and marketing of telaprevir  in support of a timely and effective commercial product launch in subsequent years if we are successful in obtaining regulatory marketing approval 
establishing the commercial supply chain for telaprevir is a multi step international endeavor involving the purchase of several raw materials  the application of certain manufacturing processes requiring significant lead times  the conversion of active pharmaceutical ingredient to tablet form and the packaging of tablets for distribution 
we expect to source raw materials  drug substance and drug product  including finished packaging  from third parties located in the far east  the european union and the united states  and we are currently establishing and expanding third party relationships in this regard 
establishing and providing quality assurance for this global supply chain requires a significant financial commitment  experienced personnel and the creation or expansion of numerous third party contractual relationships 
because of the significant lead times involved in our supply chain for telaprevir  we may have less flexibility to adjust our supply in response to changes in demand than if we had shorter lead times 
we have successfully completed the technical development work for the phase and commercial formulation of telaprevir 
we expect that the level of our investment in commercial supply of telaprevir  including costs related to building our internal infrastructure and costs related to third party manufacturing relationships  will increase significantly in while most of this investment will relate specifically to telaprevir  and is at risk if telaprevir does not advance successfully to registration  we expect that the organization and expertise that we build as part of this process will contribute to our development as a pharmaceutical company  and that it could serve the advancement of our other  earlier stage drug candidates if they progress to a commercial manufacturing stage 
similarly  we currently have limited experience as a company in sales and marketing or with respect to pricing and obtaining adequate third party reimbursement for drugs 
in order to market telaprevir in north america if it is approved  we intend to build a marketing organization and a direct sales force  which will require substantial effort and significant management and financial resources 
during  we intend to commit significant personnel and financial resources to this effort  staging our commitments to the extent possible in consideration of the ongoing telaprevir development timeline 
we will need to devote significant effort  in particular  to recruiting individuals with experience in the sales and marketing of pharmaceutical products 
competition for personnel with these skills is intense and may be particularly difficult for us since telaprevir is still an investigational drug candidate 
although our investment in this infrastructure might be lost if telaprevir is not approved or if approval is significantly delayed  we would expect our sales and marketing infrastructure for telaprevir  if telaprevir is successfully developed and commercialized  to be useful to us if and when we commercialize any additional drugs 
financing strategy at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due september  which we refer to as the notes  and million in principal amount of convertible senior subordinated notes due in february  which we refer to as the notes 
because we have incurred losses from our inception and expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  we are dependent in large part on our continued ability to raise significant funding to finance our research and development operations  our creation of a commercial infrastructure and our overhead  and to meet our long term contractual commitments and obligations 
in the past  we have secured funds principally through capital market transactions  strategic collaborative agreements  proceeds from the disposition of assets  investment income and the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
for example  we received million in july as an up front payment under our collaboration agreement with janssen and we completed an offering of million shares of our common stock in september  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
in addition  we decreased the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our convertible debt by million in through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
in february  we announced that we will redeem our notes on march  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to per share 
we expect the holders of the notes will elect to convert their notes into stock  in which case we will issue approximately million shares 
we will be required to repay any notes that are not converted at the rate of  per  principal amount  which includes principal and interest that will accrue to the redemption date 
in order to fund our research  development and manufacturing activities  particularly for later stage drug candidates  we expect to continue to pursue a general financing strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital transactions  which may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
we cannot be sure that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms if at all 
collaborations and collaborative revenues collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
we receive royalty revenues from glaxosmithkline on their sales of our hiv protease inhibitor fosamprenavir calcium  which is marketed as lexiva in the united states and telzir in europe 
in june  we entered into a collaboration agreement with janssen pharmaceutica  nv  a johnson johnson company  relating to telaprevir 
in july  janssen paid us a non refundable license payment of million 
under our agreement with janssen  we have retained exclusive commercial rights to telaprevir in north america and will lead the global clinical development program 
janssen has agreed to be responsible for of the drug development costs under the development program for telaprevir in north america and the janssen territories  to pay us additional contingent milestone payments based on successful development  approval and launch of telaprevir  and to be responsible for the commercialization of telaprevir outside of north america and the far east 
our pipeline also includes several drug candidates that are being developed by our collaborators  including mk vx and mk vx  which are being investigated by merck for oncology indications  avn vx  which is being investigated by avalon pharmaceuticals  inc for oncology indications  and vx and back up compounds  which are being investigated by glaxosmithkline for pain indications 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
these items are monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that our application of the accounting policies for restructuring  revenue recognition  research and development expenses  investments and stock based compensation  all of which are important to our financial condition and results of operations  require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
our accounting polices  including the ones discussed below  are more fully described in note b  accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab  and for revenue arrangements entered into after june   emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
our revenues are generated primarily through collaborative research  development  manufacture and commercialization agreements 
the terms of these agreements typically include payment to us of one or more of the following non refundable up front license fees  research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
agreements containing multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborator and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
the consideration received is allocated among the separate units based on each unit s fair value or using the residual method  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
research and development funding is recognized as earned  ratably over the period of effort 
substantive milestones realized in collaboration arrangements are recognized as earned when the corresponding payment is reasonably assured  subject to the following policies in those circumstances where we have obligations remaining after achievement of the milestone in those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone is reasonably assured  we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement and we have sufficient evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations  we consider the milestone payment and the remaining obligations to be separate units of accounting 
in these circumstances  we use the residual method under eitf to allocate revenue among the milestones and the remaining obligations 
in those circumstances where collection of a substantive milestone is reasonably assured  we have remaining obligations to perform under the collaboration arrangement  and we do not have sufficient evidence of fair value for our remaining obligations  we consider the milestone payment and the remaining obligations under the contract as a single unit of accounting 
in those circumstances where the collaboration does not require specific deliverables at specific times or at the end of the contract term  but rather our obligations are satisfied over a period of time  substantive milestones are recognized over the period of performance 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone payment being recognized as revenue on the date the milestone is achieved equal to the applicable percentage of the performance period that has elapsed as of the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being deferred and recognized over the remaining period of performance 
we evaluate whether milestones are substantive at the inception of the agreement based on the contingent nature of the milestone  specifically reviewing factors such as the scientific and other risks that must be overcome to achieve the milestone as well as the level of effort and investment required 
milestones that are not considered substantive and do not meet the separation criteria are accounted for as license payments and recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining period of performance 
payments received after performance obligations are met completely are recognized when earned 
royalty revenues are recognized based upon actual and estimated net sales of licensed products in licensed territories as provided by the licensee and are recognized in the period the sales occur 
differences between actual royalty revenues and estimated royalty revenues  which have not historically been significant  are reconciled and adjusted for in the quarter they become known 
research and development expenses all research and development expenses  including amounts funded by research and development collaborations  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities  including salaries and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies  contract services  including clinical trial and pharmaceutical development costs  expenses associated with the commercial supply investment in telaprevir due to telaprevir s stage of development  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
when third party service providers billing terms do not coincide with our period end  we are required to make estimates of the costs  including clinical trial costs  contract services and investment in commercial supply  incurred in a given accounting period and record accruals at period end 
we base our estimates on our knowledge of the research and development programs  services performed for the period  past history for related activities and the expected duration of the third party service contract  where applicable 
restructuring expense we record liabilities associated with restructuring activities based on estimates of fair value in the period the liabilities are incurred  in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
the liability for accrued restructuring expense of million at december  is related to that portion of our facility in kendall square  cambridge  massachusetts that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy 
this liability is calculated by applying our best estimate of our net ongoing obligation 
as prescribed by fas  we use a probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis to calculate the amount of this liability 
the probability weighted discounted cash flow analysis is based on management s assumptions and estimates of our ongoing lease obligations  including contractual rental commitments  build out commitments and building operating costs  and estimates of income from subleases  based on the term and timing of such subleases 
we discount the estimated cash flows using a discount rate of approximately 
these cash flow estimates are reviewed and may be adjusted in subsequent periods 
adjustments are based  among other things  on management s assessment of changes in factors underlying the estimates 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate will increase simply as a result of the passage of time  even if all other factors remain unchanged 
our estimates of our restructuring liability have changed in the past  and it is possible that our assumptions and estimates will change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the amount of the estimated liability 
the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
for example  we currently have two subleases for portions of the kendall square facility with remaining terms of five and six years  respectively  and we have made certain estimates and assumptions relating to future sublease terms following the expiration of the current subleases 
market variability may require adjustments to those assumptions in the future 
we will review our assumptions and judgments related to the lease restructuring on at least a quarterly basis until the kendall square lease is terminated or expires  and make whatever modifications we believe are necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
stock based compensation expense we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards board no 
r  share based payment fas r  on january  fas r requires us to measure compensation cost of stock based compensation at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  including estimated forfeitures  and to recognize that cost as an expense ratably over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by fas r and accordingly  financial statement amounts for the periods prior to january  that are presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method 
under fas r  we determine the fair value of awarded stock options and shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates concerning our stock price volatility  the rate of return of risk free investments  the expected term of the awards  and our anticipated dividends 
in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  we also are required to exercise judgment to estimate forfeiture rates for awards  based on the probability that employees will complete the required service period 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  our results could be materially affected 
altus investment in and  we assessed our investment in altus pharmaceuticals inc  which we accounted for using the cost method  on a quarterly basis to determine if there had been any decrease in the estimated fair value of that investment below its million carrying value that might have required us to write down the cost basis of the asset 
in and  we did not identify facts or circumstances that would cause us to determine that the cost basis of our interest in altus should have been changed 
if any adjustment to the estimated fair value of the investment had reflected a decline in the value of the investment below its cost  we would have considered the evidence available to us  including the duration and extent to which the decline was other than temporary 
if the decline had been considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the investment would have been written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down would have been included in the consolidated statements of operations 
altus completed an initial public offering of its common stock in january in  we sold  shares of altus common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of altus common stock for million  resulting in realized net gain of million  based on the difference between the proceeds of the sales and the carrying value of the asset 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted common share  compared to a net loss for of million  or per basic and diluted common share 
included in our net loss for was stock based compensation expense of million  restructuring expense of million  loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes of million  gains related to an investment of million and the effect of a cumulative benefit of accounting change  related to the adoption of fas r of million 
included in our net loss for was stock based compensation expense of million  net restructuring expense of million and loss on exchange of convertible subordinated notes of million 
while our net loss for increased by only million as compared to  our revenues and expenses changed significantly period to period 
in particular  our research and development expenses increased by million from to  including a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
overall  our total costs and expenses increased by million from to these increased costs and expenses were partially offset by the million increase in revenues from to our net loss per basic and diluted common share decreased in from as a result of an increase in the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding from million shares to million shares  which offset the increase in the net loss 
revenues total revenues increased to million in compared to million in in  revenues were comprised of million in royalties and million in collaborative and other research and development revenues  as compared with million in royalties and million in collaborative and other research and development revenues in royalty revenues increased by million  or  from to royalties consist of lexiva telzir fosamprenavir calcium royalty revenues and a small amount of agenerase amprenavir royalty revenues 
fosamprenavir calcium is marketed under the trade name lexiva in the united states and telzir in the european union 
royalty revenues are based on actual and estimated worldwide net sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
the increase in royalty revenues was due to the increase in lexiva telzir sales 
by the end of  lexiva telzir had largely replaced agenerase in worldwide markets 
collaborative and other research and development revenues increased million  or  from to the table presented below is a summary of revenues from collaborative arrangements for as compared with in thousands collaborative and other research and development revenues janssen merck novartis cfft glaxosmithkline other total collaborative and other research and development revenues in  we entered into one new major collaboration agreement  with janssen  which resulted in million of revenues in  including an amortized portion of the million up front payment  payments from janssen to fund a portion of telaprevir development costs  and a milestone of million 
our revenues from merck increased by million in over levels as the result of increased revenues recognized from milestone payments offset by decreased research funding 
we recognized lower revenues from novartis due to the completion of our research collaboration with novartis 
our revenues from our glaxosmithkline collaboration were higher in due to our full recognition in of the million up front license payment paid under that agreement 
in  we expect that our revenues from janssen will increase significantly as a result of the recognition over a full year of an amortized portion of the up front payment made to us by janssen in  a full year of telaprevir development cost sharing under our collaboration agreement with janssen and potentially additional milestone payments 
we expect that the increased janssen revenues will be partially offset by decreased revenues from novartis and merck as a result of the completion of the research programs with these collaborators 
merck is continuing to develop drug candidates identified under the collaboration  and we may receive additional revenues in from merck related to milestone payments 
we do not expect to receive any further revenues from novartis under our collaboration agreement 
we expect that for the foreseeable future the revenues and funding from collaborations that support our development stage compounds  such as the janssen and merck collaborations  will provide a proportionately higher level of financial support for our research and development activities than revenues and funding from research collaboration agreements 
costs and expenses royalty payments royalty payments increased million  or  to million in from million in royalty payments relate to a royalty we pay to a third party on sales of lexiva telzir and agenerase 
the increased royalty payments relate to the increased royalty revenues we received in as compared to research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  to million in  including stock based compensation expense of million  from million in  including stock based compensation of million 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily the result of increased development investment to support the global phase b clinical development program for telaprevir  as well as million of investment in commercial supply of telaprevir  together with a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the cost of developing the commercial supply for telaprevir is considered a research and development expense due to telaprevir s stage of development 
development expenses increased by million  accounting for of the aggregate increase in research and development expenses 
research expenses increased by million  of which million was increased stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salary and benefits  stock based compensation expense  laboratory supplies  contractual services including pharmaceutical development and clinical trial materials costs  commercial supply investment in telaprevir  and infrastructure costs  including facilities costs and depreciation 
set forth below is a summary that reconciles our total research and development expenses for and change change in thousands research expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services infrastructure costs total research expenses development expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services commercial supply investment in telaprevir infrastructure costs total development expenses total research and development expenses salary and benefits stock based compensation expense laboratory supplies and other direct expenses contractual services commercial supply investment in telaprevir infrastructure costs total research and development expenses to date we have incurred in excess of billion in research and development costs associated with drug discovery and development 
in  we expect to focus our development investment on telaprevir  while continuing to advance the development of vx  vx  and vx we expect research and development expenses in to be greater than in due to increased investment in clinical development  as we advance our core programs  as well as increased costs for the investment in commercial supply of telaprevir drug product in advance of obtaining regulatory marketing approval 
in  we expect to incur research and development expenses of approximately million to million for commercial supply investment in telaprevir 
we are making this investment to support a timely commercial product launch if we are successful in completing development of telaprevir and obtaining marketing approval 
in addition  we expect that our combined research and development expenses will increase in future periods as we add personnel and capabilities to support the planned development of our lead drug candidates 
however  our anticipated research and development expenses could vary materially from our projections  depending on the occurrence and timing of clinical trials and clinical trial results 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain and subject to a number of risk factors 
the duration of clinical trials may vary substantially according to the type  complexity and novelty of the drug candidate 
the fda and comparable agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the introduction of therapeutic pharmaceutical products  typically requiring lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing procedures  sampling activities and other costly and time consuming procedures 
data obtained from preclinical  nonclinical and clinical activities at any step in the testing process may be adverse and lead to discontinuation or redirection of development activity 
data obtained from these activities also are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the duration and cost of discovery  preclinical studies  nonclinical studies and clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project and are difficult to predict 
therefore  accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate costs to bring our drug candidates to market are not available 
the most significant costs associated with drug discovery and development are those costs associated with phase and phase clinical trials 
given the uncertainties related to development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our drug candidates will generate revenue and net cash inflows 
sales  general and administrative expenses sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase is the result of increased headcount to support our growth as we advance our drug candidates  particularly telaprevir  into late stage development 
we expect that our sales  general and administration expenses in will be significantly higher than in  because we are planning to build our capabilities in late stage development  drug supply  registration and commercialization of pharmaceutical products  as we advance telaprevir through clinical development 
restructuring expense we recorded net restructuring expense of million in compared to a restructuring expense of million in the expense in resulted primarily from imputed interest and build out costs related to the restructuring liability 
the expense for included a credit against the portion of restructuring liability relating to the portion of the kendall square facility that we decided in to occupy  offset by i the estimated incremental net ongoing lease obligation associated with the portion of the kendall square facility that we are not occupying and do not intend to occupy and ii imputed interest costs relating to the restructuring liability 
the activity related to the restructuring liability for is as follows in thousands liability as of december  cash payments in cash received from subleases in additional charge in liability as of december  lease restructuring liability the activity related to the restructuring liability for is as follows in thousands liability as of december  cash payments in cash received from subleases in credit for portion of facility vertex decided to occupy additional charge in liability as of december  lease restructuring liability in accordance with fas  we review our estimates and assumptions with respect to the kendall square lease on at least a quarterly basis  and will make whatever modifications we believe necessary to reflect any changed circumstances  based on our best judgment  until the termination of the lease 
our estimates have changed in the past  and may change in the future  resulting in additional adjustments to the estimate of liability  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
because our estimate of the liability includes the application of a discount rate to reflect the time value of money  the estimate of the liability will increase each quarter simply as a result of the passage of time 
non operating items interest income increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was the result of higher invested funds and portfolio yields 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in  because we reduced the level of our outstanding debt in from in  we sold  shares of the common stock of altus pharmaceuticals  inc for million and warrants to purchase  shares of altus common stock for million  resulting in a realized gain of million 
in addition  as a result of the issuance during and of common stock in exchange for a portion of our notes and notes  we recorded non cash charges of million in and million in these charges related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms 
in connection with the adoption of fas r  during we recorded a million benefit from the cumulative effect of changing from recording forfeitures related to restricted stock awards as they occurred  to estimating forfeitures during the service period 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our net loss for was million  or per basic and diluted common share  compared to a net loss for of million  or per basic and diluted common share 
our loss in included restructuring expense of million and a charge of million for the exchange of newly issued common stock for a portion of our outstanding convertible notes 
our loss in included restructuring expense of million and a charge for the retirement of convertible notes of million 
our net loss for increased by million compared to  and our revenues and expenses changed significantly from period to period 
our total revenues increased by million from to this increase was largely offset by a million increase in research and development expenses 
in addition  our net loss in included a million charge on exchange of convertible notes for which there was no comparable charge in our net loss per basic and diluted share increased due to an increase in our net loss partially offset by an increase in the basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding from million shares to million shares

the additional restructuring expense in primarily resulted from revising our estimates and assumptions about when we would identity and receive subtenants and imputing an interest charge for the related restructuring liability

this charge related to the incremental shares issued in the transactions over the number of shares that would have been issued upon the conversion of the notes under their original terms 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since our inception and historically have financed our operations principally through public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities  strategic collaborative agreements that include research and or development funding  development milestones and royalties on the sales of products  investment income and proceeds from the issuance of stock under our employee benefit programs 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  which was an increase of million from million at december  the increase was primarily a result of million in net proceeds from our september public offering of common stock  million from an up front payment we received in connection with signing the janssen agreement  million from the issuance of common stock under our employee benefit plans  and million from the sale of shares of altus pharmaceuticals inc common stock and warrants to purchase altus common stock

capital expenditures for property and equipment during were million 
at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of the notes and million in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding 
the notes are due in september and are convertible into common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to per share  subject to adjustment under certain circumstances 
in february  we announced that we will redeem our notes on march  the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the holder at a price equal to per share 
we expect the holders of the notes will elect to convert their notes into stock  in which case we will issue approximately million

in  we made cash payments of million against the accrued expense and received million in sublease rental payments 
we expect to make cash payments of approximately million against the accrued expense in and receive million in sublease rental payments 
we review our estimates underlying our accrued restructuring expense on at least a quarterly basis  and the amount of the accrued expense  and consequently any expected future payment  could change with any change in our estimates 
the net increase of million in deferred revenue for the year ended december  was a result of deferring a portion of the million up front license payment from janssen  offset by recognition of revenues in related to cash payments received from collaborators  primarily novartis and merck  in previous periods  which were deferred and recognized over our period of performance in accordance with our revenue recognition policy

at december   we had million in loans outstanding under the loan facility established under our collaboration with novartis  which is repayable  without interest  in may we expect to continue to make significant investments in our pipeline  particularly in clinical trials of telaprevir  vx  vx and vx  in our effort to prepare for potential registration  regulatory approval and commercial launch of our existing and future drug candidates 
we also expect to continue to make a significant investment in the commercial supply of telaprevir in order to manufacture sufficient quantities of drug product in advance of obtaining regulatory marketing approval  to support a timely commercial product launch if we are successful in completing the development of telaprevir and obtaining marketing approval 
we expect to incur losses on a quarterly and annual basis for the foreseeable future 
the adequacy of our available funds to meet our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  breadth and prospects of our discovery and development programs  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates and our decisions regarding manufacturing and commercial investments 
collaborations have been and will continue to be an important component of our business strategy 
as part of our strategy for managing our capital structure  we have from time to time adjusted the amount and maturity of our debt obligations through new issues  privately negotiated transactions and market purchases  depending on market conditions and our perceived needs at the time 
we expect to continue pursuing a general financial strategy that may lead us to undertake one or more additional capital transactions 
any such capital transactions may or may not be similar to transactions in which we have engaged in the past 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements for at least the next eighteen months 
to the extent that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  in addition to the above mentioned sources  are not sufficient to fund our activities  it will be necessary to raise additional funds through public offerings or private placements of our securities or other methods of financing 
we also will continue to manage our capital structure and consider all financing opportunities  whenever they may occur  that could strengthen our long term liquidity profile 
there can be no assurance that any such financing opportunities will be available on acceptable terms  if at all

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
fas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of fas is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
gaap have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
the fasb has stated it believes that fas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules regarding hedge accounting 
fas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
for example  fas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
fas does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  and fasb no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
fas will be effective as of the beginning of our first fiscal year beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that a company makes that choice in the first days of the relevant fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of fas in september  fasb issued fas fas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value measures  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect fair value measurements have on earnings 
fas does not require any new fair value measurements 
fas will be effective for us beginning january  we currently are evaluating the effect of fas on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently are evaluating fin and believe the adoption of fin will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections fas 
fas replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes and statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
fas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impractible to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
we adopted sfas beginning on january  its adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  fasb issued fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp fas  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether an impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp fas also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp fas is required to be applied to reporting periods beginning after december  we adopted fsp fas in the first quarter of adoption of fsp fas did not have a material effect on the our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the united states government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in united states dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
substantially all of our investment portfolio consists of marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity  and we have implemented guidelines limiting the term to maturity of our investment instruments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk
