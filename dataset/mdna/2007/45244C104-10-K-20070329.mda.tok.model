item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we have developed proprietary machine vision technology that converts real world information into digital electronic signals for processing by computer and applies it to traffic management problems 
the machine vision technology uses commercially available components and video cameras in conjunction with our proprietary software to create our core family of products  the autoscope video vehicle detection system 
the autoscope system is used by traffic managers primarily to improve the flow of vehicle traffic and to enhance safety at intersections  main thoroughfares  freeways and tunnels 
autoscope systems are sold to distributors and end users of traffic management products in north america  the caribbean and latin america by econolite  our licensee in those locations 
we also sell autoscope products to distributors and end users in europe and asia through our european and hong kong subsidiaries  respectively 
the majority of our revenue is derived from royalties received from econolite  with a second primary source of revenue received from product sales in europe and asia 
end users of the autoscope system throughout the world are generally funded by government agencies responsible for traffic management and or traffic law enforcement 
our success is primarily dependent upon continued governmental funding of intelligent transportation systems  such as machine vision  for traffic control  our ability  through econolite and our sales representatives in europe and asia  to successfully market the autoscope system to individual traffic managers  and our ability to develop new machine vision products and applications that enhance the traffic manager s ability to cost effectively improve traffic flow  safety and security 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied significantly in the past due to the seasonality of our business 
our second and third quarters are the strongest and the first and fourth quarters are the weakest generally due to weather conditions that make roadway construction more difficult in north america and europe 
we expect such seasonality to continue for the foreseeable future 
additionally  our international revenues have a significant large project component  resulting in a varying revenue stream 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our financial results should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain statements of income data as a percent of total revenue and gross margin on international sales and royalties as a percentage of international sales and royalties  respectively year ended december  international sales royalties total revenue gross margin international sales gross margin royalties selling  marketing and product support general and administrative research and development income from operations income taxes net income compared to total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
international sales increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in international sales was a result of better performance in our asian subsidiary  including a significant fourth quarter tunnel installation in china 
the increase in royalty income reflects the continued success of econolite s distribution of autoscope in the north american market  including an unexpectedly strong fourth quarter in gross margins for international sales decreased to in from in gross margins on royalty income increased to in up from in international gross margins were negatively impacted by slightly higher manufacturing costs and higher warranty reserves in versus royalty gross margins were positively impacted by the patent royalty we owed to the university of minnesota ending in the third quarter of we anticipate that gross margins for our international sales will be in the range of to in  while we expect royalty gross margins will approach in selling  marketing and product support expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the change related mostly to headcount additions 
we anticipate that selling  marketing and product support expense will increase both in terms of actual expense and as a percentage of total revenue in when compared to general and administrative expense increased to million or of total revenue in up from million or of total revenue in the increase resulted mainly from a combination of headcount additions  stock option expense recognition  and increased audit  tax  legal and consulting fees 
we anticipate that general and administrative expense will increase in both in terms of actual expense and as a percentage of total revenue when compared to research and development expense increased to million or of total revenue in  up from million or of total revenue in the increase was directly related to headcount additions and significant prototype material and consulting expenses incurred in accelerating technical efforts on our next generation autoscope terra product line 
we anticipate that research and development expense will increase in both in terms of actual expense and as a percentage of total revenue when compared to other income decreased to  in from  in increased interest income was offset by a  legal settlement with econolite 
we anticipate other income will increase in our income tax effective rate decreased to of pretax income in from in the decrease was due to a number of federal and state adjustments and increased research and development credits 
we expect the effective rate in to return to our historical range of to 
net income was million in compared to million in due to the factors mentioned above 
compared to total revenue increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
royalty income for increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  in the increase in royalty income in resulted primarily from increased sales volume of the autoscope solo pro product by econolite 
international sales for decreased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  in the decrease from was due to lower sales in asia  which more than offset higher sales of autoscope systems in europe 
the decline in sales in asia was primarily due to our inability to repeat a large sale in korea in and to sell a newly developed loop detector product which was to replace a similar product that we previously distributed in asia 
autoscope product sales in europe increased by over compared to primarily due to the successful expansion into eastern europe and continued acceptance of the rackvision product introduced into europe in total gross profit was million  or of revenue  in  compared to million  or of revenue  in the increase in our total gross profit margin percentage was primarily due to revenue mix  with higher margin royalty income increasing as a percentage of total revenue 
gross profit margin on international sales increased to of sales in from of sales in the increase was due primarily to selling more products directly to the end user in eastern europe  instead of through a distributor  and we did not repeat an unusually large non recurring sale of low margin cameras in that occurred in january margins on sales of the autoscope products were stable in selling  marketing and product support expenses were million  or of revenue  in  compared to million  or of revenue  in the small increase in total dollars expended resulted primarily from adding sales and support staff in europe 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenue  in  compared to million  or of revenue  in the small increase was due primarily to added professional fees and depreciation 
research and development expenses totaled million  or of revenue  in  compared to million  or of revenue  in the increase resulted primarily from adding engineering staff and assigning them to development projects and annual pay adjustments 
income taxes were million  or of pretax income  in  compared to million  or of pretax income  in the increase in income taxes was due primarily to more taxable income  while the increase in income taxes as a percentage of pretax income was due primarily to a higher effective tax rates on foreign earnings than the previous year as we were not able to benefit from the taxable loss in asia 
net income was million in compared to million in due to the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to and million in and  respectively 
the primary reasons for the increase include unusually high accounts receivables at the end of that were received early in  payables were higher in due to increased employee compensation and warranty reserves  and we had a higher non cash charge for stock option expense in the only significant use of cash in was investing million in short term investments 
the short term investments are aaa rated tax exempt auction rate securities that can be either rolled over or cashed out every days with interest rates reset every days based on auction bidding 
we have a credit agreement with wells fargo bank minnesota  na that provides up to million in short term borrowings at 
over the prime rate effective rate of at december  expiring may  any loans would be secured by inventories  accounts receivable and equipment and the bank would have the right of setoff against checking  savings and other accounts we have with the bank 
we had no outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement in or we believe that cash and cash equivalents on hand at december   our million revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank minnesota  na and cash provided by operating activities will satisfy our projected working capital needs  investing activities and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions or have relationships or other arrangements with an unconsolidated entity  including special purpose and similar entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies goodwill 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 
our recorded goodwill relates to our flow traffic subsidiary and is tested for impairment on december of each year 
the impairment test requires us to estimate the fair value of our subsidiary and then compare it to the carrying value of the subsidiary 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  further analysis is performed to determine if there is an impairment loss 
we estimate the fair value by using the income approach  where fair value is dependent on the present value of future economic benefits to be derived from ownership of flow traffic 
no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of december  and if flow traffic does not provide the future economic benefits we project  the fair value of this subsidiary may become impaired  and we would need to record an impairment loss 
revenue recognition 
royalty income is recognized based upon a monthly royalty report provided to us by econolite 
this report is prepared by econolite based on its sales of products we developed and is based on sales delivered and accepted by its customers 
we recognize revenue from international sales at the time of delivery and acceptance  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record provisions against sales revenue for estimated returns and allowances in the period when the related revenue is recorded based upon historical sales returns and changes in customer demands 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred income taxes reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes 
deferred tax assets are offset by a valuation allowance as deemed necessary based on our estimate of our future sources of taxable income and the expected timing of temporary difference reversals 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 inventory costs 
the provisions of this statement become effective for us in fiscal sfas no 
amends the existing guidance on the recognition of inventory costs to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle expense  freight  handling costs  and wasted material spoilage 
existing rules indicate that under some circumstances  items such as idle facility expense  excessive spoilage  double freight  and rehandling costs may be so abnormal as to require treatment as current period charges 
sfas no 
requires that those items be recognized as current period charges regardless of whether they meet the criterion of so abnormal 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our valuation of inventory or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this revised standard addresses the accounting for share based payment transactions in which a company receives employee services in exchange for either equity instruments of the company or that are based on the fair value of the company s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
under the new standard  companies will no longer be able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic method in accordance with apb instead  companies will be required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of income 
sfas no 
r was effective for all interim and annual periods beginning after december  the company adopted this standard in and recorded an expense of  in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position 
recognition is allowed if the tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not expect the new standard to materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements 
these methods are referred to as the roll over and iron curtain method 
the roll over method quantifies the amount by that the current year income statement is misstated 
exclusive reliance on an income statement approach can result in the accumulation of errors on the balance sheet that may not have been material to any individual income statement  but which may misstate one or more balance sheet accounts 
the iron curtain method quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
exclusive reliance on a balance sheet approach can result in disregarding the effects of errors in the current year income statement that results from the correction of an error existing in previously issued financial statements 
we currently use the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
sab no 
allows registrants to initially apply the dual approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying value of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
use of this cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
we have initially applied sab no 
using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements for the year ending december  the implementation of the new standard did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement but does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statement issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have not evaluated the impact of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
the company s foreign sales and results of operations are subject to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has not hedged its exposure to translation gains and losses 
a adverse change in foreign currency rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or financial position
