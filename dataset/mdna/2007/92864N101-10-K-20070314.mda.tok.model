overview we are an innovative designer  marketer and distributor of premium quality young mens and young womens clothing  accessories and related products under the volcom brand name 
we seek to offer products that appeal to participants in skateboarding  snowboarding and surfing  and those who affiliate themselves with the broader action sports lifestyle 
our clothing  which includes t shirts  fleece  bottoms  tops  jackets  boardshorts  denim and outerwear  combines fashion  functionality and athletic performance 
our designs are infused with an artistic and creative element that we believe differentiates our products from those of many of our competitors 
we develop and introduce products that we believe set the industry standard for style and quality in each of our product categories 
we have recently launched new product extensions to complement our current product offerings 
these new product extensions include a complete line of sandals and slip on footwear  branded creedlers  a complete collection of kids clothing for young boys ages to  and a girls swimwear line 
the creedlers and kids line began shipping in december  and the girls swimwear line will begin shipping early in spring volcom branded products are currently sold throughout the united states and in over countries internationally by either us or international licensees 
we serve the united states  canada  latin america  asia pacific and puerto rico through our in house sales personnel  independent sales representatives and distributors 
in these areas  volcom branded products are sold to retailers that we believe merchandise our products in an environment that supports and reinforces our brand image and provide a superior in store experience 
as of december   our customer base of retailers included approximately  accounts that operated approximately  store locations of which approximately  accounts that operated approximately  stores are located in the united states and distributors in countries not serviced by our licensees 
our retail customers are primarily specialty boardsports retailers and several retail chains 
except for sales made in canada and europe  all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
in europe through the distribution of the spring line  australia  indonesia  south africa and brazil  we have entered into licensing agreements with entities that we believe have local market insight and strong relationships with retailers in their respective territories 
products sold by our licensees can be found in over  store locations in europe  approximately store locations in australia  over store locations in brazil  approximately store locations in south africa and approximately store locations in indonesia 
we receive royalties on the sales of volcom branded products sold by our licensees 
our license agreements specify design and quality standards for the volcom branded products distributed by our licensees 
our licensees are not controlled and operated by us  and the amount of our licensing revenues could decrease in the future 
as these license agreements expire  we may assume direct responsibility for serving these licensed territories 
we have established our own operations in europe in anticipation of the expiration of the licensing agreement with our european licensee on december  pursuant to an agreement between us and volcom europe  volcom europe will produce and distribute the spring volcom line in europe and pay us our same royalty rate as required under the license agreement 
we expect to experience a decrease in our licensing revenues after volcom europe distributes the spring line in europe and an increase in our selling  general and administrative expense while we build the necessary infrastructure and hire employees to establish our own operations in europe 
however  we anticipate our product revenues will begin to increase in europe in the second half of once we begin to recognize revenue from the direct sale of our products in this territory 

table of contents as part of our strategy to take direct control of our european operations  we have recently completed the construction of our european headquarters in anglet  france  delivered samples to the sales team for use in their meetings with customer accounts and we are continually building the necessary infrastructure to support these european operations 
our current european team consists of employees which include design  production  sales and information technology management positions 
in february  we completed the construction of our european headquarters in anglet  france 
the construction contract called for the construction of an approximate  square meter or approximately  square foot office and distribution facility for million euros 
we have applied for and received approval to obtain local government grants totaling approximately  euros approximately million based on a euro to us dollar exchange rate as of december  
such grants will be paid to us at various times during and after our european headquarters construction period and generally require us to maintain and operate our european headquarters for five years 
as of december   we have received approximately  euros approximately  based on a euro to us dollar exchange rate as of december  with respect to such grants 
we also acquired welcom distribution sarl  or welcom  the distributor of volcom branded products in switzerland  during october we purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of welcom for a purchase price of million in cash  excluding transaction costs 
the acquisition was effective on october   and we have included the operations of welcom in our financial results from october  going forward 
our revenues increased from million in to million in based upon our experience and consumer reaction to our products and brand image  we believe that the increase in our revenues during these periods resulted primarily from increased brand recognition and growing acceptance of our products at existing retail accounts 
we believe that our marketing programs  product designs and product quality  and our relationships with our retailers contributed to this increased demand and market penetration 
in addition  several of our largest retailers have opened additional stores and those store openings likely have contributed to an increase in our product revenues  however  period over period increases in our product revenues as judged solely by additional store openings by our largest retailers may not be a useful or accurate measure of revenue increases because our products may not be carried in every new store 
growth of our revenues will depend in part on the demand for our products by consumers  our ability to effectively distribute our products and our ability to design products consistent with the changing fashion interests of boardsports participants and those who affiliate themselves with the broader action sports youth lifestyle 
sales to pacific sunwear increased  or million  for compared to however  we may see sales to pacific sunwear decline  and we currently expect a decrease in sales to pacific sunwear for compared to it is unclear where our sales to pacific sunwear will trend in the longer term 
pacific sunwear remains an important customer for us and we are working both internally and with pacific sunwear to maximize our business with them 
we believe our brand continues to be an important part of the pacific sunwear business 
we also recognize that any customer concentration creates risks and we are  therefore  assessing strategies to lessen our concentration with pacific sunwear 
we have recently announced that we are expanding the distribution of our mens and boys products in macy s west  part of federated department stores  from our initial roll out of doors for mens  which included doors for boys  to doors for mens  which includes doors for boys 
in addition  we plan to expand into doors for our recently introduced kids products 
further  we plan to expand the distribution of our mens  boys and kids line into dillard s stores located primarily in the southwest united states 
this expanded distribution will include doors for boys and kids products and doors for mens products 
these additional distribution channels are a part of our long term diversification strategy to lessen our dependence on any one customer 
our gross margins are affected by our ability to accurately forecast demand and avoid excess inventory by matching purchases of finished goods to pre season orders  which decreases our percentage of sales at discount or close out prices 
gross margins are also impacted by our ability to control our sourcing costs and  to a lesser extent  by changes in our product mix 
if we misjudge forecasting inventory levels or our sourcing costs increase and we are unable to raise our prices  our gross margins may decline 
we currently source the substantial majority of our products from third party manufacturers located primarily in china  macau  india and mexico 
as a result  we may be adversely affected by the disruption of trade with these 
table of contents countries  the imposition of new regulations related to imports  duties  taxes and other charges on imports  and significant decreases in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
we seek to mitigate the possible disruption in product flow by diversifying our manufacturing across numerous manufacturers and by using manufacturers in countries that we believe to be politically stable 
we do not enter into long term contracts with our third party manufacturers 
rather  we typically enter into contracts with each manufacturer to produce one or more product lines for a particular selling season 
this strategy has enabled us to maintain flexibility in our sourcing 
our products manufactured abroad are subject to us customs laws  which impose tariffs as well as import quota restrictions for textiles and apparel 
quota represents the right  pursuant to bilateral or other international trade arrangements  to export amounts of certain categories of merchandise into a country or territory pursuant to a visa or license 
pursuant to the agreement on textiles and clothing  quota on textile and apparel products was eliminated for world trade organization  or wto  member countries  including the united states  canada and european countries  on january  as a result of the eliminated quotas  we experienced lower costs on our imports of finished goods  which increased our gross margin as a percentage of revenues and our profitability for the year ended december  during  the united states and china agreed to a new quota arrangement  which will impose quotas on certain textile products that will impact our business through while we do not believe the limitations on imports from china will have a material affect on our operations  we intend to closely monitor our sourcing in china to avoid disruptions 
over the past five years  our selling  general and administrative expenses have increased on an absolute dollar basis as we have increased our spending on marketing  advertising and promotions  strengthened our management team and hired additional personnel 
as a percentage of revenues  however  our selling  general and administrative expenses have decreased from in to in this was largely because some of our expenses were fixed and did not increase at the same rate as that of our revenues 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues have increased from in to in this increase was primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel as we develop our infrastructure domestically and abroad  costs related to the transition of our european operations from a licensee model to direct control  additional expenses associated with operating as a public company  such as certain legal and accounting compliance costs  and compensation expense associated with stock options as required by statement of financial accounting standard no

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses the accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized upon shipment  at which time transfer of title occurs and risk of ownership passes to the customer 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms are typically net with terms up to net for snow category products 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provides for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brand and our image 
allowances for estimated returns are provided when product revenues are recorded based on historical experience and are reported as reductions in product revenues 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reported as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses when they arise 
licensing revenues are recorded when earned based on a stated percentage of the licensees sales of volcom branded products 

table of contents accounts receivable throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  our losses associated with uncollectible accounts have been consistent with our estimates  but we cannot assure you that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the lower of the cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand and adjust inventory values for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  weakening economic conditions  terrorist acts or threats  reduced consumer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and market value could be inaccurate  which could result in excess and obsolete inventory 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
as required by sfas no 
 we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates our cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and we may be required to recognize an impairment loss in the future 
any impairment losses will be reflected in operating income 
long lived assets we acquire assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows estimated to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated investees we account for our investments in unconsolidated investees using the cost method if we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
we assess such investments for impairment when there are events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if  and when  an event or change in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment is identified  we estimate the fair value of the investment and  if the reduction in value is determined to be other than temporary  we record an impairment loss on the investment 
we account for our investments in unconsolidated investees using the equity method of accounting if we have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee 
we evaluate such investments for impairment if an event or change in circumstances occurs that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment 
if  and when  an event is identified  we estimate the fair value of the investment and  if the reduction in value is determined to be other than temporary  we record an impairment loss on the investment 
on april   we sold our investment in volcom europe  our european licensee  for million 
under the terms of the sale agreement  volcom europe will continue to function as our licensee until the expiration of its license agreement on december  and through the distribution of the volcom european spring line 
during  we recorded million of earnings attributable to this equity method investee  which reflects our share of volcom europe s earnings of million  offset by an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying amount of our investment in volcom europe to million as of march  after consideration of the effects of the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments related to our investment in volcom europe of million  we recorded no gain or loss on the sale of our investment in volcom europe in april athlete sponsorships we establish relationships with professional athletes in order to promote our products and brand 
we have entered into endorsement agreements with professional skateboarding  snowboarding and surfing athletes 
many of these contracts provide incentives for magazine exposure and competitive victories while wearing or using our products 
it is not possible to determine the precise amounts we will be required to pay under these agreements  as they are subject to many variables 
the actual amounts paid under these agreements may be higher or lower than expected due to the variable nature of these obligations 
we expense these amounts as they are incurred 
income taxes on june  we changed our tax status from an s corporation to a c corporation 
for federal and state income tax purposes we had elected to be treated as an s corporation under subchapter s of the internal revenue code of and comparable state laws from january  until our initial public offering on june  therefore  no provision or liability for federal or state income tax has been included in our consolidated financial statements for   and the period from january  to june   except that we were subject to california franchise taxes of on our corporate income and a provision for these taxes was included in our consolidated financial statements for those periods 
subsequent to june   we recorded a provision and liability for federal and state income taxes using an annual effective tax rate 
upon the change in our tax status we established and recorded our deferred income taxes at our c corporation effective tax rate 
management s judgment is required in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
we consider the reversal of taxable temporary differences  future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets that had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 

table of contents stock based compensation since january  we have accounted for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires that we account for all stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
foreign currency translation substantially all of our sales have been made in us dollars except for sales made in canada  which are made in canadian dollars 
as a result  we are exposed to transaction gains and losses that result from movements in foreign currency exchange rates between the local canadian currency and the us dollar 
as our canadian sales  accounts receivable  accounts payable and canadian cash balance are a small portion of our revenues  assets and liabilities  we do not generally hedge our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  therefore we are exposed to foreign currency risk 
changes in our assets and liabilities that are denominated in canadian dollars are translated into us dollars at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date  and are reflected in our statement of operations 
we own subsidiaries in switzerland and france  which operate with the swiss franc and euro as their functional currency  respectively 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
general our revenues consist of both our product revenues and our licensing revenues 
our product revenues are derived primarily from the sale of young mens and young womens clothing  accessories and related products under the volcom brand name 
we offer apparel and accessory products in four main categories mens  girls  boys and snow

on february   we purchased real property on the north shore of oahu the pipe house for million in cash 
the pipe house will generally be used as a residence for volcom s surf team riders during the winter surf season and for other marketing activities during the year 
we currently have no material cash commitments  except our normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals  operating leases  capital leases  european headquarters construction obligation and athlete endorsement agreements 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  cash received from our initial public offering  cash flow from operating activities and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
credit facilities in july  we terminated our existing million committed  secured line of credit facility with bank of the west and entered into a new million unsecured credit agreement with bank of the west which includes a line of credit  foreign exchange facility and letter of credit sub facilities 
the new credit agreement  which expires on august   may be used to fund our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this new agreement bear interest  at our option  either at the bank s prime rate at december  or libor plus 
under this credit facility  we had million outstanding in letters of credit at december  at december  there were no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility  and million was available under the credit facility 
the new credit agreement requires compliance with conditions precedent that must be satisfied prior to any borrowing  as well as ongoing compliance with specified affirmative and negative covenants  including covenants related to our financial condition  including requirements that we maintain a minimum net profit after tax and a minimum effective tangible net worth 
at december  we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants 
contractual obligations and commitments we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or outstanding balances on our credit facility as of december  the following table summarizes  as of december   the total amount of future payments due in various future periods payments due by period total thereafter in thousands operating lease obligations facility construction obligations capital lease obligations professional athlete sponsorships contractual letters of credit total based on a euro to us dollar exchange rate at december  we lease certain land and buildings under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through  excluding extensions at our option  and contain provisions for rental adjustments  including in certain 
table of contents cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
we lease computer and office equipment pursuant to capital lease obligations 
these leases bear interest at rates ranging from to per year  and expire at various dates through october on may   we entered into a contract for the construction of our european headquarters in anglet  france 
the contract calls for the construction of an approximate  square meter or approximately  square foot facility for approximately million euros 
payments for construction of the facility will be made monthly through february and vary based upon the progress toward completion of the facility 
as of december   we have paid approximately million in construction costs and have approximately million of remaining costs to be paid through february based on a euro to us dollar exchange rate as of december  
we establish relationships with professional athletes in order to promote our products and brand 
we have entered into endorsement agreements with professional skateboarding  snowboarding and surfing athletes 
many of these contracts provide incentives for magazine exposure and competitive victories while wearing or using our products 
it is not possible to determine the precise amounts that we will be required to pay under these agreements as they are subject to many variables 
the amounts listed above are the approximate amounts of the minimum obligations required to be paid under these contracts 
the additional estimated maximum amount that could be paid under our existing contracts  assuming that all bonuses  victories and similar incentives are achieved during the five year period ending december   is approximately million 
the actual amounts paid under these agreements may be higher or lower than the amounts discussed above as a result of the variable nature of these obligations 
our contractual letters of credit have maturity dates of less than one year 
we use these letters of credit to purchase finished goods 
seasonality historically  we have experienced greater revenue in the second half of the year than in the first half due to a concentration of shopping around the fall and holiday seasons and pricing differences between our products sold during the first and second half of the year  as products we sell in the fall and holiday seasons generally have higher prices per unit than products we sell in the spring and summer seasons 
we typically sell more of our summer products boardshorts and t shirts in the first half of the year and a majority of our winter products pants  long sleeve shirts  sweaters  fleece  jackets and outerwear in the second half of the year 
we anticipate that this seasonal impact on our revenues is likely to continue 
during the two year period ended december   approximately of our revenues  of our gross profit and of our operating income were generated in the second half of the year  with the third quarter generally generating most of our operating income due to fall  holiday and snow shipments 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of the effects of seasonality  particularly in preparation for the fall and holiday shopping seasons  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each year 
during these peak periods  we had historically borrowed under our credit facility 
however  due to the proceeds received in july from our initial public offering  we do not anticipate borrowing under our credit facility in the near term 
backlog we typically receive the bulk of our orders for each of our seasons up to four months prior to the date the products are shipped to customers 
generally  these orders are not subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment 
at december   our order backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  for a variety of reasons  including the timing of release dates for our seasonal product collections  the timing of shipments  timing of order deadlines  timing of receipt of orders  product mix of customer orders and the amount of in season orders  backlog may not be a reliable measure of future sales for any 
table of contents succeeding period 
for these reasons  backlog figures in one year may not be directly comparable to backlog figures in another year when measured at the same date 
inflation we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations in the past 
there can be no assurance that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
vulnerability due to concentrations as of december   our customer base of retailers located in the united states  canada and south america included approximately  accounts that operate approximately  store locations and distributors in international territories not serviced by one of our licensees 
one customer  pacific sunwear  accounted for approximately and of our product revenues in and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our product revenues in or sales to pacific sunwear increased  or million  for compared to however  we may see sales to pacific sunwear decline  and we currently expect a decrease in sales to pacific sunwear for compared to it is unclear where our sales to pacific sunwear will trend in the longer term 
pacific sunwear remains an important customer for us and we are working both internally and with pacific sunwear to maximize our business with them 
we believe our brand continues to be an important part of the pacific sunwear business 
we also recognize that any customer concentration creates risks and we are  therefore  assessing strategies to lessen our concentration with pacific sunwear 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and source our products from independently owned manufacturers

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk substantially all of our sales have been made in us dollars except for sales made in canada  which are made in canadian dollars 
in  and  we derived  and of our product revenues  respectively  from sales in canada 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in the value of canadian dollar denominated receivables and payables  foreign currency investments  primarily consisting of canadian dollar deposits  and cash flows related to repatriation of those investments 
a weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar could negatively impact the profitability of our products sold in canada and the value of our canadian receivables  as well as the value of repatriated funds we may bring back to the united states from canada 
account balances denominated in canadian dollars are marked to market every period using current exchange rates and the resulting changes in the account balance are included in our income statement as other expense income 
we do not believe that a movement in all applicable foreign currency exchange rates would have a material effect on our financial position 
as our canadian accounts receivable  accounts payable and cash balance represent a small portion of our total assets and liabilities  we do not generally hedge our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
we may enter into future transactions in order to hedge our exposure to foreign currencies 

table of contents a small portion of our sales have been made by our subsidiaries located in switzerland and france where we operate with the swiss franc and euro  respectively  as our functional currency 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
we generally purchase finished goods from our manufacturers in us dollars 
however  we source substantially all of these finished goods abroad and their cost may be affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies 
price increases caused by currency exchange rate fluctuations could increase our costs 
if we are unable to increase our prices to a level sufficient to cover the increased costs  it could adversely affect our margins and we may become less price competitive with companies who manufacture their products in the united states 
interest rate risk we maintain a million unsecured credit agreement which includes a line of credit  foreign exchange facility and letter of credit sub facilities with no balance outstanding at december  the credit agreement  which expires on august   may be used to fund our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this agreement bear interest  at our option  either at the bank s prime rate at december  or libor plus 
based on the average interest rate on our credit facility during  and to the extent that borrowings were outstanding  we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition
