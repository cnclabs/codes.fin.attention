item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following information should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
overview we design  develop and market high performance  highly integrated and cost efficient semiconductor image sensor devices 
our main products  image sensing devices which we refer to by the name camerachip image sensors  capture an image electronically and are used in a number of consumer and commercial mass market applications 
our camerachip image sensors are manufactured using the complementary metal oxide semiconductor  or cmos  fabrication process and are predominantly single chip solutions that integrate several distinct functions including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of a fully processed image or video stream 
we believe that our highly integrated image sensors enable camera device manufacturers to build high quality camera products that are smaller  less complex  more reliable  more cost effective and more power efficient than cameras using traditional charge coupled devices  or ccds 
the current economic and market environment we operate in a challenging economic environment that has undergone significant changes in technology and in patterns of global trade 
we strive to remain a leader in the development and marketing of image sensing devices based on the cmos fabrication process and have benefited from the growing market demand for and acceptance of this technology 
we sell our products worldwide directly to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  which include branded customers and contract manufacturers  and value added resellers  or vars  and indirectly through distributors 
in order to ensure that we address all available markets for our image sensors  we divide our marketing efforts into two separate departments 
the mainstream products marketing department addresses the camera cell phone and digital still camera  or dsc  markets  and the advanced products marketing department addresses the security and surveillance  toys and games  personal computers  automotive and medical markets 
in the camera cell phone market in particular  future revenues depend to a large extent on design wins where  on the basis of an exhaustive evaluation of available products  a particular hand set maker determines which image sensor to design into one or more specific models 
there is generally a time lag of between six and nine months between the time of a particular design win and the first shipments of the designated product 
design wins are also an important driver in the many other markets that we address  and in some cases  such as automotive applications  the time lag between a particular design win and first revenue can be longer than one year 
the overwhelming majority of sales of our products depend on decisions by engineering designers and manufacturers of products that incorporate image sensors to specify one of our products rather than one made by a competitor 
in most cases  the decision to specify a particular product requires conforming other specifications of the product to the chosen image sensor and makes subsequent changes both difficult and expensive 
accordingly  the ability to produce and deliver on time reliable products in large quantities is a key competitive differentiator 
since our inception  we have shipped more than million image sensors  including approximately million in fiscal  which demonstrates the capabilities of our production system  including our sources of offshore fabrication 
we currently outsource the wafer fabrication and packaging of our image sensor products to third parties 
we outsource the color filter and micro lens phases of production to a joint venture 
this approach allows us to focus our resources on the design  development  marketing and testing of our products and significantly reduces our capital requirements 
to increase and enhance our production capabilities  last year we completed a project with tsmc  our principal wafer supplier and one of the largest wafer fabrication companies in the world  to increase from two to four the number of their fabrication facilities  at which our products can be produced 
visera  our joint venture with tsmc and our investments in two key back end packaging suppliers are part of a broad strategy to ensure that we have sufficient back end capacity for the processing of our image sensors in the various formats required by our customers 
we are currently expanding our capacity with visera 
in january  we amended our joint venture item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued agreement with tsmc to each invest an additional million in visera 
separately  tsmc purchased million shares from xintec to expand xintec s capacity 
in february  we entered into a foundry manufacturing agreement with powerchip semiconductor corporation  or psc 
we currently perform the final testing of the majority of our products ourselves 
we are also expanding our testing capacity in china  as well as our overall capability to design more custom products for our customers 
as necessary  we will make further investments to ensure that we have sufficient production capacity to meet the demands of our customers as part of our ongoing efforts to lower production costs to offset  at least in part  the continuing pressure we experience on prices 
since our end user customers market and sell their products worldwide  our revenues by geographic location are not necessarily indicative of the geographic distribution of end user sales  but rather indicate where the products and or their components are manufactured or sourced 
the revenues by geography are based on the country or region in which our customers issue purchase orders to us 
many of the products using our image sensors  such as camera cell phones  digital still cameras and cameras for toys and games  are consumer electronics goods 
these mass market camera devices generally have seasonal cycles which historically have caused the sales of our customers to fluctuate quarter to quarter 
historically  demand from oems and distributors that serve such consumer product markets has been stronger in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year and weaker in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
in addition  since a very large number of the manufacturers who use our products are located in china  hong kong and taiwan  the pattern of demand for our image sensors has been increasingly influenced by the timing of the extended lunar or chinese new year holiday  a period in which the factories which use our image sensors generally close 
we believe that the market opportunity represented by camera cell phones remains very large 
we benefited from growth in shipments of image sensors  particularly for camera cell phones in fiscal  driven by increased demand for our vga  megapixel and megapixel image sensors 
we also believe that  like the digital still camera market  camera cell phone demand will not only continue to shift toward higher resolutions  but also will increasingly fragment into multiple resolution categories 
in addition  there is increased demand for customization  and several different interface standards are coming to maturity 
all of these trends will require the development of an increasing variety of products 
as the markets for image sensors have grown  we have experienced competition from manufacturers of cmos and ccd image sensors 
our principal competitors in the market for cmos image sensors include magnachip  micron  samsung  st microelectronics and toshiba 
we expect to see continued price competition in the image sensor market for camera cell phones and digital cameras as those markets continue to grow 
although we believe that we currently compete effectively in those markets  our competitive position could be impaired by companies that have greater financial  technical  marketing  manufacturing and distribution resources  broader product lines  better access to large customer bases  greater name recognition  longer operating histories and more established strategic and financial relationships than we do 
such companies may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and customer requirements or devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
many of these competitors own and operate their own fabrication facilities  which in certain circumstances may give them the ability to price their products more aggressively than we can or may allow them to respond more rapidly than we can to changing market opportunities 
as a result of the increase in competition and the growth of various consumer product applications for image sensors  we have experienced a shortening in the life cycle of some image sensor products 
for example  although in the security and surveillance market we continue to sell image sensors introduced more than four years ago  in the camera cell phone market  product life cycles can be as short as six months 
with the shortening of product life cycles  it will be increasingly difficult to accurately forecast customer demand for our products 
as a result  we face the risk of being unable to fulfill customer orders if we underestimate market demand and the risks of excess inventory and product obsolescence if we overestimate market demand for our products 
the shortening of product life cycles also increases the importance of having short product development cycles and being accurate in the prediction of market trends in the design of new products 
the reduction in product life cycles increases the importance of our continued investment in research and development  which we consider to be critical to our future success 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in common with many other semiconductor products and as a response to competitive pressures  the average selling prices  or asps  of image sensor products have declined steadily since their introduction  and we expect asps to continue to decline in the future 
accordingly  in order to maintain our gross margins  we and our suppliers have to work continuously to lower our manufacturing costs and increase our production yields  and in order to maintain or grow our revenues  we have to increase the number of units we sell by a large enough amount to offset the effect of declining asps 
in addition  if we are unable to timely introduce new products that can take advantage of smaller process geometries or new products that incorporate more advanced technology and include more advanced features that can be sold at higher average selling prices  our gross margin will decline 
we have migrated the production of our new sensors to the process geometries  which has enabled us to increase the resolution of our image sensors while decreasing overall chip size 
we initiated mass production volumes at the end of calendar given the rapidly changing nature of our technology  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter delays or other unexpected yield issues with future products 
during the early stages of production  production yields and gross margins for new products are typically lower than those of established products 
we can encounter unexpected manufacturing issues  such as the unexpected back end problems that resulted in low yields on two of our products  the first of which arose in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products 
due to our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we will need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products 
as a result  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages for certain products and build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
we carefully consider the risk that our inventories may be excess to expected future demand and record appropriate reserves 
if  as sometimes happens  we are subsequently able to sell these reserved products  the sales have little or no associated cost and consequently they have a favorable impact on gross margins 
strategy our strategic goal is to produce the image sensors of choice for all available end use markets 
the most important elements of our strategy are the following maintain technology leadership 
we intend to maintain our position as a leader in cmos image sensor technology by continuing to develop our expertise in mixed signal implementation  advanced pixel design  feature integration  and manufacturing processes and controls  including automated testing 
our image sensor integrates both the sensor and the signal processor into a single chip  often eliminating the requirement for a separate dsp 
as a result  our camerachip image sensors offer camera device manufacturers advantages in terms of size  power consumption  cost and ease of design 
for example  we have successfully migrated full volume production from     and to process geometries  which has enabled us to increase the resolution of our image sensors while decreasing overall chip size 
we have announced the latest generation of our omnipixel technology  our omnipixel architecture  which is based on process geometry and expect to begin volume production in the near future 
we are continuing to develop products using still narrower geometries 
we have successfully developed sensor technology from  pixels to megapixels  underscoring our ability to deliver a wide range of solutions to address changing market demands 
we are committed to continue increasing image quality and to reducing the overall size of the camerachip image sensor s array 
continue to develop our proprietary technology to maintain competitive advantage 
we intend to continue to develop proprietary intellectual property to maintain our competitive advantage 
we have developed a variety of proprietary technologies that expand the utility of our camerachip solutions 
for example  we have produced camerachip image sensors capable of generating useable data in both low light and bright light conditions simultaneously 
this high dynamic range  or hdr  technology enables the use of camerachip image sensors in demanding environments such as in automotive and security applications 
our commitment to enhancing our proprietary technology is also reflected in our acquisition of cdm and its wavefront coding technology 
leverage expertise across multiple mass market applications 
we intend to continue to focus on developing our camerachip image sensors for multiple mass market applications 
to date we have shipped over million item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued camerachip image sensors 
as camera functionality becomes a standard feature in a wider variety of consumer  commercial and industrial applications  we expect that additional markets will emerge 
in the past  we have leveraged our expertise in certain end markets to expand into emerging mass market applications for our camerachip image sensors 
for example  we used the expertise we developed in camera cell phone markets to develop image sensors for laptop pc applications 
other markets and applications we are focusing on include security and surveillance  toys and interactive video game consoles  and the multiple opportunities in automotive and medical applications 
increase our market presence 
we intend to increase our visibility and penetration into new product designs by collaborating with oems  vars and distributors and by entering into partnerships with other companies that offer complementary and supporting technologies 
in certain instances we will provide design services to our contract manufacturing partners  enabling them to increase their overall value added through the production of highly tailored end products  which we believe will increase the likelihood that they will recommend the use of our products to branded manufacturers 
in addition  we will team with companies that offer complementary and supporting technologies to integrate our products with theirs for use in the reference designs that they promote to manufacturers 
as a result  we believe that we are able to provide our customers with valuable design and marketing references 
further develop close customer relationships 
we intend to enhance our customer relationships by continuing to collaborate with our customers on the design and specification of their products 
we work with customers during various stages of their product development cycles  including strategic decision making  new product design and replacement design to help them develop a logical technology migration path and to ensure that our products meet their future design needs 
by working closely with our customers  we believe we can better anticipate their future design needs and increase the likelihood that they will incorporate our camerachip image sensors into their products 
our solution we specifically design our highly integrated camerachip image sensors to be cost effective and to provide high image quality 
by integrating a number of distinct functions onto a single cmos chip  including image capture  image processing  color processing  signal conversion and output of images for either digital or analog equipment  our camerachip image sensors offer camera device manufacturers a number of benefits  including high image quality and resolution 
we have developed a number of proprietary methods for enhancing image quality by increasing our camerachip image sensors sensitivity to light and significantly improving their signal to noise ratio 
these methods allow us to reduce the size of each individual pixel and thereby increase the number of pixels in a given sensor 
the result is a portfolio of several high resolution camerachip image sensors currently ranging up to a megapixel product 
in addition  we are able to produce camerachip image sensors at lower resolutions with smaller pixel arrays  which serves to reduce the overall cost of the camerachip image sensor and its supporting components  such as lenses 
lower cost 
the highly integrated design of our camerachip image sensor enables us to deliver image sensors to our customers at a cost which makes the cameras they are part of less and less expensive 
this cost saving is driven  in large part  by the fact that we have been able to achieve a high level of functionality in a single chip  while at the same time reducing the overall size of the device 
in some cases  our competitors solutions requires components or chips to achieve the same level of functionality 
our integrated solution reduces the number of parts subject to failure and thus increases the reliability of our image sensors 
smaller size and lower power consumption 
our highly integrated solution enables our customers to develop cameras that are smaller in size and use less power than cameras based on multi chip solutions 
for portable applications such as cell phones  size and power consumption are critical design considerations for device manufacturers 
our camerachip image sensors integrate the image capture and signal processing circuitry on a single chip  often eliminating the requirement for a separate digital signal processor  or dsp  thus consuming less board space in the device and enabling our customers to reduce the overall size of their products or to integrate additional functions 
we believe that the size and power characteristics of our camerachip image sensors will item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued enable us to penetrate new mass market applications as device manufacturers take advantage of their ability to integrate complete camera functionality in their products without sacrificing other key functions or performance 
accelerated time to market 
the highly integrated nature of our camerachip image sensor simplifies the design of cameras and allows our customers to shorten their product design cycles 
this provides our cell phone industry and consumer electronics customers with critical competitive advantages  as time to market is typically a major determinant of product success and longevity 
we also work closely with our customers to accelerate product development cycles by providing camera reference designs  engineering design review services and customer product evaluation  testing and debugging services 
in addition  we have designed our manufacturing and production processes to allow us to quickly ramp production volumes to meet increased customer demand  which is particularly important in the high volume markets in which we participate 
streamlined manufacturing and production 
our camerachip image sensors are well suited for production using the relatively simple  low cost and large scale wafer fabrication processes developed for other semiconductor products that use the cmos process 
we work closely with our foundry partners and with all the other providers of the manufacturing services we require to produce our final products to refine their processes in order to optimize sensor performance and yields 
ease of use 
our single chip cmos design outputs video in industry standard formats directly from the chip 
these formats include the national television system committee  or ntsc  format and or the phase alternating line  or pal  format for analog video 
for digital video  our sensors output unprocessed data called rgb and or a standard signal color encoding system known as yuv 
as a result  our camerachip image sensors can be quickly and easily integrated into products targeted at numerous mass markets 
this is especially important in markets such as in cell phones  pcs and pdas  where video imaging expertise has not been fully developed 
capital resources as of april   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately million in short term investments 
to mitigate market risk related to short term investments  we have an investment policy designed to preserve the value of capital and to generate interest income from these investments without material exposure to market fluctuations 
market risk is the potential loss due to the change in value of a financial instrument as a result of changes in interest rates or bond prices 
our policy is to invest in financial instruments with short maturities  limiting interest rate exposure  and to measure performance against comparable benchmarks 
we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations with ratings of a or better and money market funds 
in june  our board of directors authorized us to use up to million of our available cash in an open market program to repurchase our common stock 
at the expiration of the program on june   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in february  our board of directors approved an additional stock repurchase program that provides for the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
subject to applicable securities laws  such repurchases will be at times and in amounts as we deem appropriate  based on factors such as market conditions  legal requirements and other corporate considerations 
see note treasury stock to our consolidated financial statements 
sources of revenues we generate almost all our revenue by selling our products directly to oems and vars and indirectly through distributors 
we treat sales to oems and vars as one source of revenue  and distributors as another 
our revenue recognition policies for the two groups are different 
see critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition below for additional information regarding recognition of revenue 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  long lived assets  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and our beliefs of what could occur in the future considering available information 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our estimates reflect the following critical accounting policies revenue recognition in general  we sell to our customers on fob shipping point or fca terms 
for shipments to customers without agreements that allow for returns or credits  principally oems and vars  we recognize revenue using the sell in method 
under this method  we recognize revenue when title passes to the customer provided that we have received a signed purchase order  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred to the customer  collection of resulting receivables is considered reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining material obligations 
we provide for future returns of potentially defective products based on historical experience at the time we recognize revenue 
for cash consideration given to customers for which we do not receive a separately identifiable benefit or cannot reasonably estimate fair value  we record the amounts as reductions of revenue 
for shipments to distributors under agreements allowing for returns or credits  we recognize revenue using the sell through method under which we defer revenue and related costs of sales until the distributor resells the product to our end user customer and notifies us in writing of such sale 
the amount billed to these distributors  less the cost of inventory shipped to but not yet sold by the distributors  is shown net on the consolidated balance sheets as deferred income 
accounting for revenue on the sell through method requires that we obtain sales and inventory information from our distributors 
as part of our internal control process  we observe our distributors physical counts of their inventories of our products on a regular basis 
in order to determine whether collection is probable  we assess a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer the recognition of revenue until collection becomes reasonably assured or upon receipt of payment 
in addition  we recognize revenue from the performance of services to a limited number of our customers by our wholly owned subsidiary  cdm  and  through december   by our then consolidated affiliate  visera 
we recognize the cdm associated revenue under either the completed contract or the percentage of completion methods 
the percentage of completion method of accounting is used for cost reimbursement type contracts  where revenues recognized are that portion of the total contract price equal to the ratio of costs expended to date to the anticipated final total costs based on current estimates of the costs to complete the projects 
cdm associated revenue has not been material in any of the periods presented 
until december  we recognized visera s service revenue from third party customers when the production services provided by visera were complete and the product was shipped to the customer 
allowance for doubtful accounts we undertake credit evaluations for all major sale transactions before we release product for shipment 
normal payment terms apply upon transfer of risk of loss 
on an ongoing basis  we analyze the payment history of customer accounts  including recent customer purchases 
we evaluate aged items in accounts receivable and provide item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued allowances for doubtful accounts 
customer creditworthiness and economic conditions may change and increase the risk of collectibility and may require additional allowances  which would negatively impact our operating results 
as of april   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented approximately of total accounts receivable 
allowance for sales returns and warranties based on historical sales returns and other known factors  we provide for estimated sales returns in the same period we record the related revenues 
to estimate sales returns and allowances  we analyze potential customer specific product application issues  potential quality and reliability issues and historical returns 
we evaluate quarterly the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
this allowance is reflected as a reduction to accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
increases to the reserve are recorded as a reduction to net revenues 
because the allowance for sales returns is based on our judgments and estimates  particularly as to product application  quality and reliability issues  our reserves may not be adequate to cover actual sales returns and other allowances 
if our reserves are not adequate  our net revenues could be adversely affected 
we warrant to our customers that our products will work in accordance with their respective specifications 
due to the cost and other complexities associated with rectifying any product defects  we do not repair any defective products 
if a product is defective  the customer notifies us and  with our approval  returns the defective product 
we then send replacement products to the customer 
accordingly  we account for any exposure related to defective products as a portion of our allowance for sales returns 
the net change in our allowance for sales returns balance in fiscal was approximately of revenues  and the allowance was approximately of total accounts receivable at april  excess and obsolete inventory and effect on gross margin we regularly monitor inventory quantities on hand and record allowances for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on historical usage rates and our forecast of future demand for our products 
we record allowances for the cost of inventories when the number of units on hand exceeds the number of units that we forecast will be sold over a certain period of time  generally months 
when we recognize the allowance  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration of or increase in that newly established cost basis 
because of risk of obsolescence  we will generally provide for the costs of our inventories in excess of our forecast for the applicable period 
in fiscal  and  from time to time  we sold certain previously reserved products 
even though we have sold some products at a price that was less than our original cost  sales of these products improved our gross margins because the inventory was previously reserved 
we attempt to control our inventory levels so that we do not hold inventories in excess of demand for the succeeding three months 
however  because we need to place non cancelable orders with significant lead time and because it is difficult to estimate product demand  it is possible that we will build inventories in excess of demand for future periods 
if we have inventories in excess of estimated product demand  we will provide an allowance  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position 
in preparation for new product introductions  we gradually decrease production of established products  while preparing for production of newer products 
given our week production cycle  it is extremely difficult to predict precisely how many units of established products we need 
it is also difficult to accurately predict the speed of the ramp of new products or the projected life cycles of new products which have continued to shorten in duration 
under these circumstances  it is possible that we could suffer from shortages of certain products and also build inventories in excess of demand for other products 
stock based compensation expense effective may   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payment awards 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions  including our stock price  expected volatility  expected term  risk free interest rate and expected item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued dividend yield 
for expected volatility  we use an average between the historical volatility of our common stock  and the implied volatility of traded options on our common stock 
the expected term of the awards is based on historical data regarding our employees option exercise behaviors 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
in addition to the requirement for fair value estimates  sfas no 
r also requires the recording of expense that is net of an anticipated forfeiture rate 
only expenses associated with awards that are ultimately expected to vest are included in our financial statements 
our forfeiture rate is determined based on our historical option cancellation experience 
we evaluate the black scholes assumptions that we use to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
with respect to the forfeiture rate  we will revise the rate  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense related to future stock based payments may differ significantly from estimates recorded in prior periods 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
fsp r provides an alternative transition method of accounting for the tax effects of adopting sfas no 
r 
this fsp grants one year from the later of the date of the fsp or the adoption of sfas no 
r to us for determination of the one time election for purposes of transition 
we have elected to use the long form method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we also chose to derecognize both the gross deferred tax assets and the offsetting valuation allowance pertaining to net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that represent excess tax benefits from stock based awards 
we have also elected to use the with and without approach as described in eitf topic no 
d in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized 
as a result  we will recognize a tax benefit from stock based awards in additional paid in capital only if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock based awards on other tax attributes  such as r d tax credit  through the income statement 
valuation of long lived assets although to date  we have not recognized any impairment losses  we assess whether the value of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets  including property and equipment and prepaid wafer credits  has been impaired annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of assets useful lives and future cash flows 
if such events occur  we would estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the undiscounted expected future cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would recognize an impairment loss 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following operating losses  significant negative industry trends  significant underutilization of the assets  and significant changes in how we use the assets or our plans for their use 
accounting for income taxes as of april   we had recorded a valuation allowance of million to offset california r d tax credit carryovers 
we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these carryovers 
in the future  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued when the credit is utilized and the valuation allowance is released  the release of valuation allowance will be accounted for as a reduction of the income tax expense in the year such event occurs 
for fiscal  and  the income tax provision reflected an effective tax rate of  and  respectively 
these rates are less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately principally because we earn a portion of our profits in jurisdictions where tax rates are lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate 
we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal may be higher than in fiscal but will continue to be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
achieving an effective tax rate in fiscal that is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally dependent upon the amount of non deductible stock based compensation expenses and the proportion and geographic mix of our income 
litigation and contingencies from time to time  we have been subject to legal proceedings and claims with respect to such matters as patents and other actions arising out of the normal course of business  as well as other matters identified in legal proceedings in part i  item of this annual report 
it is possible that other companies might pursue litigation with respect to any claims such companies purport to have against us 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with respect to intellectual property rights relevant to our products that could arise in the future  we could be required to obtain licenses to the infringed technology  pay substantial damages under applicable law  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products or to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology 
litigation frequently involves substantial expenditures and can require significant management attention  even if we ultimately prevail 
given the uncertainties associated with litigation  if our assessments prove to be wrong  or if additional information becomes available such that we estimate that there is a possible loss or possible range of loss associated with these contingencies  then we would record the minimum estimated liability  which could materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of our operations as a percentage of revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results we can expect for any future period 
fiscal year ended april  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research  development and related selling  general and administrative litigation settlement  net of recovery of  total operating expenses income from operations interest income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes minority interest net income revenues we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of our image sensor products 
revenues increased to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues increased item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenue growth was driven primarily by an increase in unit sales of our image sensor products  primarily for cell phones  partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices 
revenues from sales to oems and vars as compared to distributors we sell our image sensor products either directly to oems and vars or indirectly through distributors 
the percentage of revenues from sales to distributors was significantly higher in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we expect that revenues from sales through distributors will continue to represent a higher proportion of our total revenues than they have in prior fiscal years 
the following table shows the percentage of revenues from sales to oems and vars and distributors in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  oems and vars distributors total oems and vars 
the one oem customer that accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal was foxconn  which accounted for approximately of our revenues 
the two oem customers that accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal were lite on technology corporation  or lite on  which accounted for approximately of our revenues and sanshin electronics co  ltd  or sanshin electronics  which accounted for approximately of our revenues 
the two oem customers that accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal were lite on  which accounted for approximately of our revenues and sanshin electronics  which accounted for approximately of our revenues 
for fiscal  and  no other oem or var customer accounted for or more of our revenues 
distributors 
the two distributors that accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal were world peace and sida electronics  which accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively 
the one distributor that accounted for or more of our revenues in fiscal and was world peace  which accounted for approximately and of our revenues  respectively

revenues from domestic sales as compared to foreign sales the following table shows the percentage of our revenues derived from sales of our image sensor products to domestic customers as compared to foreign customers in each of fiscal  and fiscal year ended april  domestic sales foreign sales total we derive the majority of our foreign sales from customers in asia and  to a lesser extent  in europe 
over time  our sales to asia pacific customers have increased primarily as a result of the continuing trend of outsourcing the production of consumer electronics products to asia pacific manufacturers and facilities and to the increasing markets in asia for consumer products 
because of the preponderance of asia pacific manufacturers and the fact that virtually all products incorporating our image sensor products are sold globally  we believe that the geographic distribution of our sales does not accurately reflect the geographic distribution of sales into end user markets of products which incorporate our image sensors 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued gross profit comparison of fiscal and fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was of revenues  down from the we reported for fiscal the principal cause of the year over year decline in our gross margin was the decline in our average selling prices and a less favorable product mix  in particular the larger share of lower margin vga sensors in our unit and dollar volume as compared to the previous year  which were only partially offset by reductions in our production costs 
during fiscal  we recognized credits of million in compensation from suppliers whose product quality in previous periods did not meet our standards 
in addition  we recorded approximately million in stock based compensation expense to cost of revenues in fiscal in accordance with sfas no

we adopted sfas no 
r effective may  and there was no similar expense in the prior fiscal year 
the sale of the products that were affected by the back end yield issues which arose in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal reduced our gross margin in fiscal by approximately basis points 
revenue from sales of previously reserved products in fiscal was million  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we recorded provisions of million to cost of sales for excess and obsolete inventory as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we consolidated the operating results of soi 
consolidating soi reduced our gross margin by approximately and basis points in fiscal and  respectively  however  because soi s operating expense ratio is lower than ours  soi s operating income as a percentage of revenue  or operating margins  are comparable to ours and do not have a material impact on our consolidated operating margins 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal our gross margin for fiscal was of revenues  down from the we reported for fiscal the principal cause of the year over year decline in our gross margin was a decline in our average selling prices  offset  in part  by a more favorable product mix and by reductions in our production costs 
revenue from sales of previously reserved products in fiscal was million  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we recorded an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million to cost of sales as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  our gross profit benefited from a million reduction in cost of goods sold as the result of the settlement of a dispute related to the late cancellation of an order from one of our customers 
in fiscal  we consolidated the operating results of soi  whereas in the prior year period we accounted for soi under the equity method of accounting 
consolidating soi reduced our gross margin by approximately basis points in fiscal  however  because soi s operating expense ratio is lower than ours  soi s operating income as a percentage of revenue  or operating margins  are comparable to ours and do not have a material impact on our consolidated operating margins

research  development and related research  development and related expenses consist primarily of compensation and personnel related expenses  non recurring engineering costs and costs for purchased materials  designs  tooling  depreciation of computers and workstations  and amortization of acquired intangible intellectual property and computer aided design software

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research  development and related expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the recognition of million in stock based compensation expense recognized with the adoption of sfas no 
r  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel  a million increase in software expenses  a million increase in non recurring engineering expenses related to new product development and a million increase in amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets 
the increase in non recurring engineering expenses is primarily due to an increase in the number of new designs we released to our foundry partners 
we anticipate that our research  development and related expenses will continue to increase as we develop and introduce new products employing our omnipixel and wavefront coding technologies and develop other new technologies related to image sensors 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in research  development and related expenses of approximately million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel  a million increase in amortization expenses of acquired intangible assets primarily associated with the acquisition of cdm  a million increase in office expenses  a million increase in patent related expenses  a million increase in facility related expenses and a million increase in outside service expenses

r  a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel  a million increase in commissions paid to distributors and manufacturers representatives associated with increased revenues  a million increase in outside service expenses and a million increase in facility expenses  partially offset by a million reduction in legal expenses 
we anticipate that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in the future due to the continued expansion of our organization and the continuing upgrade of our computer systems  including our enterprise resource planning  or erp  and other management information systems 
comparison of fiscal and fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million  or  for fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from a million increase in salary and payroll related expenses  a million increase in accounting expenses resulting from the work we performed to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley legislation and audit related expenses due to the increasing size and complexity of our organization  a million increase in outside service expenses  a million increase in travel expenses  and a million increase in our provision for bad debts 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in legal expenses due principally to the absence of the expenses incurred in the prior year for the investigation into  and subsequent restatement of  our financial statements for the first three quarters of fiscal and a million reduction in stock compensation charges 
litigation settlement  net of recovery of million we accrued million in litigation settlement expenses in fiscal  net of recovery of million  to reflect our share of a tentative settlement of a securities class action lawsuit pending in the united states district item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued court for the northern district of california

other income expense  net  for fiscal was expense of million and consisted of approximately million representing our portion of the income recorded by xintec and  representing our portion of the income recorded by impac technology co  ltd  or impac 
offsetting these items was a million contra income item  which reflected residual income attributable to the interest in visera that we do not own 
the income was earned through our sale of inventory purchased from visera prior to january   the effective date of the deconsolidation 
prior to the deconsolidation  we reported the income attributable to the equity interest that we did not own as part of minority interest expense 
in the eight months ended december   we accounted for xintec under the equity method prior to our reversion to the cost method beginning on january  there was also a  expense reflecting the change in fair value of an interest rate swap

we recorded a provision for income taxes for fiscal  and of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  and  the effective rates were  and  respectively 
these rates were less than the combined federal and state statutory rate of approximately because we earn a substantial portion of our income in jurisdictions where tax rates are lower than in the united states 
the higher effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was principally due to the unfavorable impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r  partially offset by an increase in tax exempt interest income  an increase in the research and development  or r d  tax credit due to the retroactive extension of the united states r d tax credit  the release of tax reserves due to expiration of statute of limitations on assessment  and the change in proportion and geographical mix of income 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the geographic mix of income between domestic and foreign entities for fiscal we expect that our consolidated effective tax rate in fiscal will continue to be less than the combined federal and state statutory rates 
the extent to which our effective tax rate in fiscal is less than the combined federal and state statutory rates is principally contingent upon the amount of non deductible stock based compensation and the proportion and geographic mix of item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our total pre tax income 
we anticipate that there will be greater volatility in our future effective tax rates due to the adoption of fin  see recent accounting pronouncements below for further discussion

there was no minority interest in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity at april  consisted of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
liquidity our working capital decreased by approximately million to million as of april  from million as of april  the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in cash and cash equivalents  a million increase in the accrual for the settlement of the securities class action litigation  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued income taxes payable which increased as a consequence of additional provisions in fiscal and a million increase in deferred income 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in inventories as the result of increases in product demand for the first quarter of fiscal which required us to accelerate our production schedules in the fourth quarter  a million increase in recoverable insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of the securities class action litigation  million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities to support increased levels of operations and a million increase in refundable and deferred income taxes 
in march  we purchased a complex of four buildings in santa clara  california  or the santa clara property 
in connection with the purchase  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a domestic bank on march  the loan and security agreement provides for a term mortgage loan in the principal amount of million  or the mortgage loan  and a secured line of credit with an aggregate maximum principal amount of up to million  or the term loan 
borrowings under the mortgage loan accrue interest at the london interbank borrowing rate  or libor  rate plus basis points 
borrowings under the term loan accrue interest at the libor rate plus basis points 
the mortgage and term loans mature on march  and september   respectively 
in order to secure the obligations  on march  we also entered into a deed of trust  assignment of rents and leases  security agreement and fixture filing made by us to first american title insurance company for the benefit of the domestic bank and a stock pledge agreement between us and the domestic bank 
the loan and security agreement requires us to comply with certain affirmative covenants including  but not limited to  meeting certain minimum financial standards  as well as certain negative covenants limiting our ability to take certain actions without the prior written consent of the domestic bank including  but not limited to  selling or leasing the santa clara property or merging or consolidating with another entity 
in addition  the loan and security agreement provides that upon the occurrence of certain events of default our obligations under the loan and security agreement may become immediately due and payable  or the domestic bank may cease making additional advances under the term loan or otherwise extending credit to us under the loan and security agreement 
as of april   we were in compliance with the financial covenants of the loan and security agreement 
as of april   the entire million amount of the mortgage loan was outstanding

as of april   there were no borrowings item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued outstanding under the term loan 
see note borrowing arrangements of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
concurrent with the mortgage loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap with the bank to help manage interest rate risk 
the swap is for a period of ten years  and the notional amount of the swap approximates the principal outstanding under the mortgage loan 
we are the fixed rate payer under the swap with a fixed rate of approximately per annum  and the effective rate on the mortgage loan is fixed at approximately 
we measure the swap at fair value and record it as either an asset or a liability  depending on whether the fair value is a gain or loss to us 
soi maintains four unsecured lines of credit with three commercial banks  which provide a total of approximately million in available credit 
all borrowings under the four lines of credit maintained by soi bear interest at the market interest rate prevailing at the time of borrowing 
there are no financial covenant requirements for these facilities and at april   there were no borrowings outstanding under these facilities 
cash flows from operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal the principal components of the current year amount were net income of approximately million for fiscal  adjusted for non cash charges of million in stock based compensation  million in depreciation and amortization  million in the minority interest in the net income of our consolidated affiliate  million of gains in equity investments and million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in inventories  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  a million increase in refundable and deferred income taxes and a  increase in accounts receivable  net 
the  increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the decline in the level of revenues during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the increase in days of sales outstanding as of april  to days from days as of april  the million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets principally reflects million in recoverable insurance proceeds associated with the settlement of securities class action litigation 
the million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities resulted from a litigation settlement accrual associated with the settlement of securities class action litigation 
the million increase in inventories was principally the result of increases in product demand for the first quarter of fiscal which required us to accelerate our production schedules in the fourth quarter 
the increase in inventory balances resulted in a decline in annualized inventory turns to as of april  from as of april  our accrued income taxes payable increased as a consequence of additional provisions in fiscal for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million as compared to million for fiscal  primarily due to net income of approximately million for fiscal  adjusted for non cash charges of million in depreciation and amortization  million in the minority interest in the net income of consolidated affiliates and million in tax benefits from stock option exercises  a million increase in accrued income taxes payable  a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities  a million decrease in refundable and deferred income taxes and a million decrease in inventories  partially offset by a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets  and million increase in accounts receivable  net 
the million increase in accounts receivable  net  reflects the higher level of revenues during fiscal  partially offset by a decrease in days of sales outstanding to days as of april  from days as of april  the million decrease in inventories was attributable to our reduction of finished goods inventories late in the fiscal year  partially offset by an increase in work in process inventory 
inventory turns increased to as of april  from as of april  cash flows from investing activities for fiscal  cash used in investing activities increased to approximately million from million for fiscal due primarily to million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million in purchases of long term investments  million resulting from the deconsolidation of visera and million in net purchases of short term investments 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued for fiscal  cash used in investing activities decreased to approximately million from million for fiscal due primarily to million in purchases of property  plant and equipment  million of in purchases of long term investments  and million in purchases of intangible assets 
these uses were partially offset by a million in proceeds from the consolidation of visera  net of cash payments and million in net proceeds from the sales or maturities of short term investments 
cash flows from financing activities for fiscal  net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million as compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for fiscal primarily due to million in proceeds from long term borrowings under our mortgage loan to purchase the santa clara property  million principally in a cash contribution to visera by tsmc and dai nippon printing co  ltd  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through our employee stock purchase plan for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal and million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
for fiscal  net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal primarily due to million in payments for repurchase of our common stock  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and employee purchases through our employee stock purchase plan to approximately million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal and million in a cash contribution to visera by tsmc 
capital resources we currently expect our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  together with cash that we expect to generate from business operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our foreseeable capital requirements 
other than normal working capital requirements  we expect our capital requirements in fiscal to consist primarily of funding at visera to expand capacity available to us and to complete the upgrade and expansion of our testing capacity 
we are obligated to pay an additional million in cash upon the sale  prior to the end of april  of a pre determined number of revenue producing products incorporating cdm s technology 
cdm and the costs associated with the acquisition are included in our consolidated balance sheets at april  and in june  our board of directors authorized us to use up to million of our available cash in an open market program to repurchase our common stock 
at the expiration of the program on june   we had cumulatively repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in february  our board of directors authorized a further million stock repurchase program 
as of april   we had not repurchased any shares under this program 
our ability to generate cash from operations in the future is subject to substantial risks described above under item a 
risk factors 
we encourage you to review these risks carefully 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of april  and the effect such obligations and commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases capital leases mortgage obligation noncancelable orders total contractual obligations other commercial commitments investment in hwsc investment in shanghai design center total commercial commitments total contractual obligations and commercial commitments represents the remaining million of registered capital for our subsidiary  hwsc

sdc will use the funds to develop land and construct facilities for its use 
see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  we entered into a mortgage loan with a domestic bank in the amount of million

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin fin requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
in the first step  recognition  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criterion 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the differences between the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact fin will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
based on our preliminary analysis  we expect a substantial portion of our accrued income taxes payable balance of million as of april  to be reclassified in fiscal as a non current liability 
in addition  the adoption of fin may result in greater volatility in our future effective tax rates 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands the requisite disclosures for fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements but rather establishes a common definition of fair value to be used throughout generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
is effective in fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
does not affect any existing accounting literature that requires certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
sfas no 
does not establish requirements for recognizing and measuring dividend income  interest income  or interest expense 
this statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards 
sfas no 
is effective in fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact sfas no 
may have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we sell our products globally  in particular to branded customers  contract manufacturers  vars and distributors in china  hong kong  japan  korea and taiwan 
the great majority of our transactions with our customers and vendors are denominated in us dollars 
the expenses we incur in currencies other than us dollars include certain costs affecting gross profit  selling  general and administrative and research  development and related expenses  which are primarily incurred in china  where the chinese yuan renminbi cny is the local currency and taiwan  where the new taiwan dollar is the local currency 
since july  the chinese central bank has benchmarked the cny against a basket of currencies  and as of april  has allowed the cny to appreciate by approximately against the us dollar 
as of april   the functional currency of our wholly owned subsidiaries located in hong kong  omnivision technologies hong kong company limited and omnivision trading hong kong company ltd  in the cayman islands  omnivision international holding  ltd 
and huawei technology international  ltd  and in china  hwsc and sdc  is the us dollar 
our other wholly owned subsidiaries have their respective local currencies as their functional currencies 
the functional currency of our consolidated affiliate  soi  is the new taiwan dollar 
transaction gains and losses resulting from transactions denominated in currencies other than the respective functional currencies are included in other income expense  net for the periods presented 
the amounts of transaction gains and losses for fiscal  and were not material 
given that the only expenses that we incur in currencies other than us dollars are certain costs which historically have not been a significant percentage of our revenues  we do not believe that our foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk is significant 
consequently  we do not believe that a change in foreign currency exchange rates would have a significant effect on our future net income or cash flows 
we have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies or used any other derivative financial instruments as we do not believe that we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk 
although we transact our business in us dollars  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the competitiveness of our products and results of operations 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents and short term investments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuation in interest rates  which may affect our interest income and  in the future  the fair market value of our investments 
we manage our exposure to financial market risk by performing ongoing evaluations of our investment portfolio 
we presently invest in money market funds  certificates of deposit issued by banks  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  high grade corporate securities and government bonds maturing approximately months or less from the date of purchase 
we also invest in auction rate securities which have a final maturity date of up to thirty years but whose interest rate is reset principally up to every days  and in variable rate demand notes  which have a final maturity date of up to thirty years but whose interest rate is reset at varying intervals typically between and days 
due to the short maturities of our investments  the carrying value should approximate the fair market value 
in addition  we do not use our investments for trading or other speculative purposes 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  we do not expect that an immediate change in interest rates would have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
during fiscal  we financed the purchase of a four building complex with an million mortgage loan 
the mortgage loan is a variable rate loan which bears interest at libor plus basis points and changes in the interest rate will affect our interest payments 
concurrent with the mortgage loan  we also entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount that approximates the principal outstanding under the mortgage loan 
we are the fixed rate payer under the swap with a fixed rate of 
consequently  we do not believe that a hypothetical change in libor would have a material effect on our annual interest expense
