critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting polices are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the selection and application of these accounting principles and methods requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as certain financial statement disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to the recognition of revenue  allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  restructuring costs  actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans  and contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while management believes that the estimates and assumptions it uses in preparing the financial statements are appropriate  these estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties regarding their ultimate outcome  and therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the company has identified its critical accounting policies and estimates below 
these are policies and estimates that the company believes are the most important in portraying the company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
accounting for goodwill and intangible assets two issues arise with respect to these assets that require significant management estimates and judgment a the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and b the ongoing evaluation for impairment 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  business combinations  the company allocates the cost of acquired companies to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets  such as customer relationships  are amortized to expense over time  while purchase price allocated to in process research and development  if any  is recorded as a charge at the acquisition date if it is determined that it has no alternative future use 
the company s future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of identifiable intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
accordingly  the allocation of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill has a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to intangible assets and goodwill requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate to value these cash flows 
should different conditions prevail  material write downs of net intangible assets and or goodwill could occur 
the company has acquired certain identifiable intangible assets in connection with its acquisition of vestcom s marketing and business communications division in january and the acquisition of certain technology assets of plum computer consulting  inc in april these identifiable intangible assets primarily consist of the value associated with customer relationships  technology  covenants not to compete  and in process research and development 
the valuation of these identifiable intangible assets is subjective and requires a great deal of expertise and judgment 
for these reasons  the company has used independent third party valuation firms to value these assets 
the values of the customer relationships were primarily derived using estimates of future cash 
table of contents flows to be generated from the customer relationships 
this approach was used since the inherent value of the customer relationship is its ability to generate current and future income 
the value of the covenants not to compete was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the value of the technology and in process research and development were primarily derived using the income approach based on future revenue projections 
the company determined that the amount attributable to the in process research and development did not contain significant future value to the company and accordingly the amount was expensed as of the date of acquisition 
while different amounts would have been reported using different methods or using different assumptions  the company believes that the methods selected and the assumptions used are the most appropriate for each asset analyzed 
in addition  the company was required to perform valuations of the operating leases that were acquired as part of the mbc acquisition 
the operating leases were revalued to reflect the current market conditions related to the acquired leases as of the acquisition date 
any adjustments that were required to reflect the differential between the current market rate and the market rate as of the acquisition date were reflected in the purchase price allocation  and the corresponding asset or liability will be amortized over the remaining life of the lease 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets requires annual impairment testing of goodwill based upon the estimated fair value of the company s reporting units 
at december   our goodwill balance was  in testing for potential impairment of goodwill  sfas requires the company to allocate goodwill to the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates  estimate the fair value of those reporting units to which goodwill relates  and determine the carrying value book value of those reporting units 
furthermore  if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value for a particular reporting unit  then we are required to estimate the fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business 
only after this process is completed is the amount of goodwill impairment determined 
accordingly  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
the fair value of the company s reporting units was estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows 
additionally  an assumed terminal growth rate was used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal growth rates and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based upon historical experience  financial forecasts  and industry trends and conditions 
these assumptions are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying business 
a decline in expected cash flows or the estimated terminal value could cause reporting units to be valued differently 
if the reporting units do not meet projected operating results  then this analysis could potentially result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  depending on the estimated value of the company s reporting units 
additionally  an increase in the assumed discount rate could also result in goodwill impairment 
based on our analysis  the company has concluded that there is no impairment of goodwill related to its continuing operations 
however  during the company concluded that there was an impairment of goodwill related to its discontinued decisionquest business and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million during the second quarter of this business was sold during the third quarter of the results of operations from this business are reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which requires that i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenue related to its financial communications segment and marketing business communications segment when services are completed or when the printed documents are shipped to customers 
revenue for completed but unbilled work is recognized based on the company s historical standard pricing for type of service and is adjusted to actual when billed 
the company accounts for sales and other use taxes on a net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement 
therefore  these taxes are excluded from revenue and cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits the company realizes that it will be unable to collect all amounts that it bills to its customers 
therefore  it estimates the amount of billed receivables that it will be unable to collect and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits during each accounting period 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables 
the company s estimates are based on  among other things  the aging of its account receivables  its past experience collecting receivables  information about the ability of individual customers to pay  and current economic conditions 
while such estimates have been within our expectations and the provisions established  a change in financial condition of specific customers or in overall trends experienced may result in future adjustments of our estimates of recoverability of our receivables 
as of december   the company had an allowance for doubtful accounts and sales credits of  accounting for income taxes accounting for taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood the company would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
as part of the process of preparing the company s financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
the judgments and estimates used are subject to challenge by domestic and foreign taxing authorities 
it is possible that either domestic or foreign taxing authorities could challenge those judgments and estimates and draw conclusions that would cause the company to incur liabilities in excess of those currently recorded 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based upon the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
changes in the geographical mix or estimated amount of annual pre tax income could impact the company s overall effective tax rate 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december  and  the company had deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of  and  respectively 
at december  and  management determined that it is more likely than not that  and  respectively  of such assets will be realized  resulting in a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  which are related to certain foreign net operating losses and foreign capital losses which may not be utilized in future years 
the company evaluates quarterly the realization of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the primary factor used to assess the likelihood of realization is the company s forecast of future taxable income 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
accounting for pensions the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other retirement plans  sfas which was adopted in december these standards require that expenses and liabilities recognized in financial statements be actuarially calculated 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the future performance of plan assets 
according to sfas  the company is now required to recognize the funded status of the plans as an asset or liability in the financial statements  measure defined benefit postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the 
table of contents employer s fiscal year  and recognize the change in the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in other comprehensive income 
the primary assumptions used in calculating pension expense and liability are related to the discount rate at which the future obligations are discounted to value the liability  expected rate of return on plan assets  and projected salary increases 
these rates are estimated annually as of december the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate was at december   compared to at december  and at december  the at december  was used to calculate the pension expense 
each percentage point change in the discount rate would result in an million change in the projected pension benefit obligation and a million change in annual pension expense 
the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolio 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with anticipated future market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
for through the company s expected return on plan assets has remained at 
each percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would result in a million change in annual pension expense 
the projected salary increase assumption is based upon historical trends and comparisons of the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate  it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
management has used the rate of for the past three years 
restructuring accrual during fiscal years   and  the company recorded significant restructuring charges 
the company accounts for these charges in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
accounting for costs associated with existing leased facilities is based on estimates of current facility costs and is offset by estimates of projected sublease income expected to be recovered over the remainder of the lease 
these estimates are based on a variety of factors including the location and condition of the facility  as well as the overall real estate market 
the actual sublease terms could vary from the estimates used to calculate the initial restructuring accrual  resulting in potential adjustments in future periods 
in management s opinion  the company has made reasonable estimates of these restructuring accruals based upon available information 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas requires that employers recognize on a prospective basis the funded status of an entity s defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in the financial statements  requires the measurement of defined benefit postretirement plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and requires recognition of the change in the funded status of defined benefit postretirement plans in other comprehensive income 
sfas also requires additional disclosures in the notes to the financial statements 
the effects of adopting sfas are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the company adopted the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance to public companies regarding the process given to the consideration of prior year misstatements when determining materiality in current year financial statements 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in january  the company adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r as described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas r replaces statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic method of accounting  and requires all share based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their 
table of contents fair values 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  and accordingly  prior period results have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of recognizing compensation cost relating to stock options 
all new awards are subject to the provisions of sfas r 
the following table illustrates the impact of adopting sfas r on the company s income from continuing operations before income taxes  income from continuing operations  net loss  earnings per share from continuing operations  and loss per share for the year ended december  december  impact on income from continuing operations before income taxes impact on income from continuing operations impact on basic earnings per share from continuing operations impact on diluted earnings per share from continuing operations impact on net loss impact on basic loss per share impact on diluted loss per share in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that currently are not required to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective no later than fiscal years beginning on or after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
in addition  sfas requires that fair value measurements be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas does not require new fair value measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact this standard may have on its financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the purpose of fin is to clarify the accounting and disclosure for uncertain tax positions in an enterprise s financial statements 
according to fin  tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon its adoption and in subsequent periods 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact this interpretation may have on its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s market risk is principally associated with trends in the domestic and international capital markets  particularly in the financial communications segment 
this includes trends in the initial public offerings and mergers and acquisitions markets  both important components of the financial communications segment 
the company also has market risk tied to interest rate fluctuations related to its debt obligations and fluctuations in foreign currency  as discussed below 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to its short term investment portfolio  long term debt obligations  revolving credit agreement and synthetic lease agreement 

table of contents the company does not use derivative instruments in its short term investment portfolio 
the company s debentures issued in september and synthetic lease agreements are fixed rate instruments  and therefore  would not be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the debentures have a fixed interest rate of 
the company s five year million senior unsecured revolving credit facility bears interest at libor plus a premium that can range from basis points to basis points depending on certain leverage ratios 
during the year ended december   there was no average outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility and no balance outstanding as of december   therefore  there is no significant impact from a hypothetical increase in the interest rate related to the revolving credit facility during the year ended december  foreign exchange rates the company derives a portion of its revenues from various foreign sources 
revenue from the company s international financial communications operations is denominated in foreign currencies  while some of its costs are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not use foreign currency hedging instruments to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations 
the company has reflected translation adjustments of   and  in its consolidated statements of stockholders equity for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these adjustments are primarily attributed to the fluctuation in value between the us dollar and the euro  pound sterling and canadian dollar 
equity price risk the company s investments in marketable securities were approximately million as of december   primarily consisting of auction rate securities 
these securities are fixed income securities with limited market fluctuation risk 
the company s defined benefit pension plan holds investments in both equity and fixed income securities 
the amount of the company s annual contribution to the plan is dependent upon  among other things  the return on the plan s assets 
to the extent there are fluctuations in equity values  the amount of the company s annual contribution could be affected 
for example  a decrease in equity prices could increase the amount of the company s annual contributions to the plan
