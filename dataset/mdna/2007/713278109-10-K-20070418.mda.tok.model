item a risk factors our business faces significant risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
if any of the events or circumstances described as risks below actually occurs  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
risks related to pep boys if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations  our liquidity will suffer and we may be unable to satisfy our obligations 
we require significant capital to fund our business 
while we believe we have the ability to sufficiently fund our planned operations and capital expenditures for the balance of fiscal year  circumstances could arise that would materially affect our liquidity 
for example  cash flows from our operations could be affected by changes in consumer spending habits or the failure to maintain favorable vendor payment terms or our inability to successfully implement sales growth initiatives 
we may be unsuccessful in securing alternative financing when needed  on terms that we consider acceptable  or at all 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences to your investment in our securities  including the following risks our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired in the future  a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  thereby reducing the funds available for other purposes  our failure to comply with financial and operating restrictions placed on us and our subsidiaries by our credit facilities could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business or our prospects  and if we are substantially more leveraged than some of our competitors  we might be at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors that have lower debt service obligations and significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
we depend on our relationships with our vendors and a disruption of these relationships or of our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our business depends on developing and maintaining productive relationships with our vendors 
many factors outside our control may harm these relationships 
for example  financial difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them 
in addition  our failure to promptly pay  or order sufficient quantities of inventory from our vendors may increase the cost of products we purchase or may lead to vendors refusing to sell products to us at all 
a disruption of our vendor relationships or a disruption in our vendors operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we depend on our senior management team and our other personnel  and we face substantial competition for qualified personnel 
our success depends in part on the efforts of our senior management team 
our continued success will also depend upon our ability to retain existing  and attract additional  qualified field personnel to meet our needs 
we face substantial competition  both from within and outside of the automotive aftermarket to retain and attract qualified personnel 
in addition  we believe that the number of qualified automotive service technicians in the industry is generally insufficient to meet demand 
we are subject to environmental laws and may be subject to environmental liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products we sell and use in our service bays  the recycling of batteries  tires and used lubricants  and the ownership and operation of real property 
as a result of investigations undertaken in connection with a number of our store acquisitions and financings  we are aware that soil or groundwater may be contaminated at some of our properties 
any failure by us to comply with environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us 
risks related to our industry our industry is highly competitive  and price competition in some categories of the automotive aftermarket or a loss of trust in our participation in the do it for me market  could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings 
the automotive aftermarket retail and service industry is highly competitive and subjects us to a wide variety of competitors 
we compete primarily with the following types of businesses in each category of the automotive aftermarket do it yourself retail automotive parts and accessories stores  automobile dealers that supply manufacturer replacement parts and accessories  and mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell automotive products and select non automotive merchandise that appeals to automotive do it yourself customers  such as generators  power tools and canopies 
do it for me service labor regional and local full service automotive repair shops  automobile dealers that provide repair and maintenance services  national and regional including franchised tire retailers that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services  and national and regional including franchised specialized automotive such as exhaust  brake and transmission repair facilities that provide additional automotive repair and maintenance services 
installed merchandise commercial mass merchandisers  wholesalers and jobbers some of which are associated with national parts distributors or associations 
tire sales national and regional including franchised tire retailers  and mass merchandisers and wholesale clubs that sell tires 
a number of our competitors have more financial resources  are more geographically diverse or have better name recognition than we do  which might place us at a competitive disadvantage to those competitors 
because we seek to offer competitive prices  if our competitors reduce their prices we may also be forced to reduce our prices  which could cause a material decline in our revenues and earnings and hinder our ability to service our debt 
with respect to the service labor category  the majority of consumers are unfamiliar with their vehicle s mechanical operation and  as a result  often select a service provider based on trust 
potential occurrences of negative publicity associated with the pep boys brand  the products we sell or installation or repairs performed in our service bays  whether or not factually accurate  could cause consumers to lose confidence in our products and services in the short or long term  and cause them to choose our competitors for their automotive service needs 
vehicle miles driven may decrease  resulting in a decline of our revenues and negatively affecting our results of operations 
our industry depends on the number of vehicle miles driven 
factors that may cause the number of vehicle miles and our revenues and our results of operations to decrease include the weather as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of inclement weather  the economy as during periods of poor economic conditions  customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  and during periods of good economic conditions  consumers may opt to purchase new vehicles rather than service the vehicles they currently own and replace worn or damaged parts  gas prices as increases in gas prices may deter consumers from using their vehicles  and travel patterns as changes in travel patterns may cause consumers to rely more heavily on train and airplane transportation

improving service center performance 
we are working to improve the financial performance of our service center operations by improving tire sales and related attachment sales  and improving labor productivity 
to improve tire sales  we have reduced our advertised opening price points  while offering attractive opportunities for customers to upgrade to tires with better warranties  features  or brands 
in addition  we have emphasized training our staff to offer beneficial services related to each tire sale such as wheel balancing  alignments and warranties  as well as to provide a thorough safety check that highlights any further car maintenance or repair needs

in fiscal  improved operating results and working capital management  real estate sales and reduced capital expenditures allowed us to reduce our total debt by  and to repay in full  of borrowings against our company owned life insurance policy assets 
while the primary capital expenditures for the fiscal year continue to be attributed to store redesigning  the rate of our store refurbishment program was decreased significantly both as a result of our decision in the second quarter to extend it through fiscal as well as its increased cost effectiveness
