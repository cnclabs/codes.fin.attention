when making commercial business loans  the company considers the financial statements of the borrower  the company s lending history with the borrower  the debt service capabilities of the borrower  the projected cash flows of the business  and the value of the collateral  if any 
commercial business loans are generally secured by a variety of collateral including accounts receivable  inventory  and equipment  and are generally supported by personal guarantees 
commercial business loans are considered to involve more risk than loans secured by real estate 
because commercial business loans often depend on the successful operation or management of the business  repayment of such loans may be affected by adverse conditions in the economy 
moreover  commercial business loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower s business  and  therefore  depend substantially on the success of the business itself 
any collateral securing commercial business loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and to liquidate  and may fluctuate in value 
consumer loans the company offers consumer loans in order to provide a full range of financial services to its customers 
consumer loans totaled million and accounted for approximately of total loans as of june  most of the consumer loans that the company originates include home equity mortgage loans  home equity lines of credit  automobile loans  recreational vehicle loans  loans secured by deposit accounts and unsecured loans 
consumer loans are offered primarily on a fixed rate basis and for terms up to months based on the type of collateral 
the company s home equity loans and home improvement loans  are generally secured by the borrower s principal residence 
the underwriting standards employed by the company for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant s credit history and an assessment of ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan 
creditworthiness of the applicant is of primary consideration  however  the underwriting process also includes a comparison of the value of the collateral in relation to the proposed loan amount 
the company also requires fire and casualty insurance  as well as  title insurance or an opinion of counsel regarding good title  on all properties securing real estate loans made by the company 
the company also purchases blanket insurance coverage to protect its interests in consumer real estate and personal property collateral to the extent that the borrower lets such insurance lapse 
consumer loans generally have shorter terms and higher rates of interest than first mortgage real estate loans  but typically involve more credit risk than such loans because of the nature of the collateral and  in some instances  the absence of collateral 
in general  consumer loans are more dependent upon the borrower s continuing financial stability  are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances  and are often secured by rapidly depreciating personal property such as automobiles 
in addition  various laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that may be recovered from a borrower 
however  such risks are mitigated to some extent in the case of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit 
these types of loans are secured by a lien of the borrower s residence for which the total principal balance outstanding including the first mortgage does not generally exceed of the property s value  although exceptions are sometimes made for high net worth or other qualifying borrowers 
home equity loans are generally fixed rate and may have terms of up to thirty years and may include a balloon payment 
the company believes that the higher yields earned on consumer loans compensate for the increased risk associated with such loans and that consumer loans are important to the company s efforts to increase the interest rate sensitivity and shorten the average maturity of its loan portfolio 
in conjunction with its consumer lending activities  the company offers customers credit life and disability insurance products underwritten and administered by an independent insurance provider 
the company receives commission revenue related to the sales of these products 
loan solicitation and processing loan originations are derived from a number of sources such as walk in traffic  third party referrals  existing customers  and calling programs 
upon receipt of a loan application  a credit report is obtained to verify specific information relating to the applicant s credit standing 
in the case of a real estate loan  an appraisal of the real estate intended to secure the proposed loan is made by an independent appraiser approved by the company 
for those loans that are sold to investors  an automated underwriting system provided by either federal national mortgage association fnma or the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc is used in many cases 
frequently  a private mortgage insurance contract underwriter approved by the investor is used 
loans that are not sold or loans that are not underwritten by a contract underwriter are reviewed by an underwriter in the company s loan department and or at least one member of the company s internal loan committee 
one to four family residential mortgage loans and commercial business loans with principal balances in excess of million must be submitted by the loan department directly to a committee of the board of directors for approval 
multi family and non residential real estate loans with principal balances in excess of million must be submitted by the loan department directly to a committee of the board of directors for approval 
approvals subsequently are ratified by the full board of directors 
once the loan is approved  a loan commitment is promptly issued to the borrower 
if the loan is approved  the commitment letter specifies the terms and conditions of the proposed loan including the amount of the loan  interest rate  amortization term  a brief description of the required collateral  and required insurance coverage 
loan commitments the company issues standby loan origination commitments to qualified borrowers primarily for the construction and purchase of residential and non residential real estate 
such commitments are made on specified terms and conditions and are made for periods of up to days  during which time the interest rate is locked in 
the company generally charges a loan fee based on a percentage of the loan amount 
the company also charges a commitment fee for single family residential properties if the borrower receives the loan from the company 
commitment fees are generally not charged for multi family  non residential real estate  and commercial business loans 
the company s experience has been that few commitments for loans on one to four family residential properties expire without being funded by the company 
however  commitments to originate multi family  non residential real estate  and commercial business loans may not be funded 
loan origination and other fees in addition to interest earned on loans  the company generally receives loan origination fees 
to the extent that loans are originated or acquired for the company s portfolio  the company defers loan origination fees and costs and amortizes such amounts as yield adjustments over the life of the loans using the interest method of amortization 
fees and costs deferred are recognized into income immediately upon the sale of the related loan 
in addition to loan origination fees  the company also receives other fees and service charges that consist primarily of late charges and loan servicing fees on loans sold 
loan origination and commitment fees are volatile sources of income 
such fees vary with the volume and type of loans and commitments made and purchased and with competitive conditions in the company s mortgage markets  which in turn respond to the demand for and availability of money 
non performing loans loans are generally placed on non accrual status and considered non performing when  in the judgment of management  the probability of collection of principal or interest is deemed to be insufficient to warrant further accrual of interest 
as of june   million or of gross loans were considered non performing 
when a loan is placed on non accrual and or non performing status  previously accrued but unpaid interest is deducted from interest income 
in general  the company does not record accrued interest on loans or more days past due
