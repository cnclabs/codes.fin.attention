item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations analyzes the consolidated financial condition  changes in financial position  and results of operations for the three years ended december   of the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes contained herein 
certain of the statements contained herein  other than statements of historical fact  are forward looking statements 
these statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of and include estimates and assumptions related to economic  competitive  and legislative developments 
these forward looking statements are subject to change and uncertainty  which are  in many instances  beyond our control and have been made based upon our expectations and beliefs concerning future developments and their potential effect on us 
actual developments and their results could differ materially from those expected by us  depending on the outcome of certain factors  including the possibility of general economic and business conditions that are different than anticipated  legislative developments  changes in interest rates or the stock markets  stronger than anticipated competitive activity  as well as the factors described in the safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of section below with respect to forward looking statements contained herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates and assumptions discussed in this section are those that we consider to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they inherently involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
in developing these estimates  we make subjective and complex judgments that are inherently uncertain and subject to material change as facts and circumstances develop 
although variability is inherent in these estimates  we believe the amounts provided are appropriate based on the facts available upon compilation of the financial statements 
also  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses we calculate our best estimate of the reserve for losses to provide for the estimated costs of settling claims on loans reported in default  as of the date of our financial statements 
additionally  we provide a reserve for loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us incurred by not reported using an estimate based on the percentage of actual reported defaults 
our reserving process incorporates various components in a model that gives effect to current economic conditions and segment defaults by a variety of criteria 
the criteria include  among others  policy year  lender  geography and the number of months and number of times the policy has been in default  as well as whether the defaults were underwritten as flow business or as part of a structured bulk transaction 
frequency and severity are the two most significant assumptions in the establishment of our loss reserves 
frequency is used to estimate the ultimate number of paid claims associated with the current defaulted loans 
the frequency estimate assumes that long term historical experience  taking into consideration criteria such as those described in the preceding paragraph  and adjusted for current economic conditions that we believe will significantly impact the long term loss development  provides a reasonable basis for forecasting the number of claims that will be paid 
severity is the estimate of the dollar amount per claim that will be paid 
the severity factors are estimates of the percent of the risk in force that will be paid 
the severity factors used are based on an analysis of the severity rates of recently paid claims  applied to the risk in force of the loans currently in default 
the frequency and severity factors are updated quarterly 
economic conditions and other data upon which these factors are based may change more frequently than once a quarter 
therefore  significant changes in reserve requirements may become evident three or more months following the underlying events that would necessitate the change 

table of contents the estimation of loss reserves requires assumptions as to future events  and there are inherent risks and uncertainties involved in making these assumptions 
economic conditions that have affected the development of loss reserves in the past may not necessarily affect development patterns in the future in either a similar manner or degree 
to provide a measure of the sensitivity on pretax income and loss reserves carried on the balance sheet  we have provided the following table that quantifies the impact of percentage increases and decreases in both the average frequency and severity as of december  sensitivity analysis effect on pretax income from changes in assumptions decrease in factors increase in factors resulting in an resulting in a increase in pretax decrease in income pretax income in thousands increase decrease in the frequency factors utilized in the loss reserve model increase decrease in the severity factors utilized in the loss reserve model increase decrease in both the frequency and severity factors utilized in the loss reserve model the impact on loss reserves on the balance sheet would be to decrease reserves under favorable development and to increase reserves for unfavorable development 
there would be no impact on liquidity resulting from the change in reserves 
however  there would be a change in cash or invested assets equal to the increase or decrease in the ultimate paid claims related to the change in reserves 
we believe that a increase or decrease in frequency or severity is reasonably likely based on potential changes in future economic conditions and past experience 
economic conditions that could give rise to an increase in the frequency rate could be a sudden increase  or a prolonged period of increase in the unemployment rate while  conversely  a sudden drop in interest rates or a sustained period of economic and job growth could decrease the frequency rate 
a sudden nationwide or widespread regional decline in home prices  or a prolonged period of flat or slowly depreciating home prices could increase the severity while a significant increase  or steady sustained growth in house price appreciation could decrease the severity 
because the estimate for loss reserves is sensitive to the estimates of claims frequency and severity  we perform analyses to test the reasonableness of the best estimate generated by our loss reserve process 
our loss reserve estimation process and our analyses support the reasonableness of the best estimate of loss reserves recorded in our financial statements 
see the losses and expenses section below for a more detailed discussion of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
investments valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid  publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix developed by our outside investment advisors for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning a the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  b credit quality and c expected maturity 
we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion  properly valued  and any other than temporary impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
the timely identification and valuation of potentially impaired securities involves many judgments 
the most significant judgments that we make relate to the estimated future cash flows on potentially impaired securities and our intent and ability to hold a security to anticipated recovery of value 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
see further discussion of the valuation of our investment portfolio and the methodology to identify potential impairments under the investment portfolio section below 

table of contents deferred policy acquisition costs the costs of acquiring new business  principally commissions and certain policy underwriting and issue costs which are primarily related to the production of new business  are capitalized as deferred policy acquisition costs dac 
amortization of dac is charged to expense in proportion to premium recognized over the estimated policy life 
we make judgments in the determination of estimated policy life utilized in the amortization assumptions 
the most significant judgment that we make is the estimated life of the dac 
see further discussion of dac under the financial position section below 
overview through our subsidiaries  we provide primary and modified pool mortgage guaranty insurance coverage to residential mortgage lenders and investors as a credit enhancement vehicle 
we classify insurance as primary when we are in the first loss position and the ltv is or greater when the loan is first insured 
we classify all other insurance as modified pool 
the majority of our primary insurance is delivered through the flow channel  which is defined as loans originated by lenders and submitted to us on a loan by loan basis 
we also provide mortgage insurance to lenders and investors who seek additional default protection typically secondary coverage or on loans for which the individual borrower has greater than equity  capital relief  and credit enhancement on groups of loans that are sold in the secondary market 
these transactions are referred to as our structured bulk channel business 
those individual loans in the structured bulk channel in which we are in the first loss position and the ltv ratio is greater than are classified as primary 
all of our modified pool insurance is delivered through the structured bulk channel 
our revenues principally consist of a initial and renewal earned premiums from flow business net of reinsurance premiums ceded as part of our risk management strategies  b initial and renewal earned premiums from structured bulk transactions  and c investment income on invested assets 
we also realize investment gains  net of investment losses  periodically as a source of revenue when the opportunity presents itself within the context of our overall investment strategy 
our expenses essentially consist of a amounts paid on claims submitted  b changes in reserves for estimated future claim payments on loans that are currently in default  c general and administrative costs of acquiring new business and servicing existing policies  d other general business expenses  and e income taxes 
our profitability depends largely on a the volume of business insured combined with the adequacy of our product pricing and underwriting discipline relative to the risks insured  b persistency levels  c operating efficiencies  and d the level of investment yield  including realized gains and losses  on our investment portfolio 
we define persistency as the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations of policies originated during the past twelve months are not considered in our calculation of persistency 
this method of calculating persistency may vary from that of other mortgage insurers 
we believe that our calculation presents an accurate measure of the percentage of insurance in force remaining from twelve months prior 
cancellations result primarily from the borrower refinancing or selling insured mortgaged residential properties and  to a lesser degree  from the borrower achieving prescribed equity levels at which the lender no longer requires mortgage guaranty insurance 

table of contents consolidated results of operations following is selected financial information for the last three years change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages and per share information earned premiums net losses and loss adjustment expenses other operating expenses net income diluted earnings per share net income for grew over as a result of strong growth in earned premiums that exceeded growth of operating expenses and net losses and loss adjustment expenses 
growth of our insurance in force and strong persistency coupled with an increase in basis points on primary business generated the growth in earned premiums 
basis points on primary business increased due to higher premiums charged on new insurance with risk adjusted rates such as alt a loans and adjustable rate mortgages arms  including potential negative amortization loans 
production of these products increased throughout as discussed further in the production and in force and revenues sections below 
growth and seasoning of our insurance in force combined with refinements in the frequency and severity factors utilized in our calculation of our reserves caused net losses and loss adjustment expenses for to increase significantly over insurance in force was billion at december  compared to billion at december  and billion at december  this growth along with a greater percentage of loans entering the peak claim paying period increased both the number and amount of paid claims during direct paid losses increased to million for from million for the actual number of claims paid for increased over as well 
in addition to paid claims  net losses and loss adjustment expenses also includes the change in reserves 
we increased reserves million during compared to million during the increase in was due to an increase in the number of defaults  but also reflects the impacts of the increase in the frequency and severity factors due to the declining housing market and growth in our average portfolio loan size 
other operating expenses for increased over due to organizational changes and staff additions to support our growth  expensing of stock options in  and strategic initiatives  including expenses associated with entering the canadian market 
in july  we announced our intention to submit an application to incorporate a canadian subsidiary to begin operations in canada 
the canadian company will be a monoline provider of mortgage guaranty insurance and  pending regulatory approvals  could start operations sometime in we incurred approximately  of expenses in relating to legal fees  consulting  personnel and application fees in connection with this process 
we expect these expenses to increase during as we continue to put the necessary personnel and infrastructure into place in anticipation of the commencement of business in that year 
the increase in diluted earnings per share for over was consistent with the increase in net income 
realized investment gains  net of taxes  increased diluted earnings per share in by and had no impact on diluted earnings per share in diluted realized gains and losses per share is a non gaap measure 
we believe this is relevant and useful information to investors because  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  it shows the effect that our discretionary sales of investments had on earnings 
net income for declined from  as losses and loss adjustment expenses grew faster than earned premium during the growth in net losses and loss adjustment expenses in was principally a result of the ongoing seasoning of our insurance portfolio 
in  we experienced an increase in the number of paid claims and the number of reported defaults that caused us to significantly increase our reserve for losses to reflect these trends 
we experienced growth in earned premiums in  driven by moderate growth of our risk in force combined with an increase in premium basis points related to specific lender programs and a change in the mix of business 
realized investment gains increased diluted earnings per share by in we describe our results in greater detail in the discussions that follow 
the information is presented in three categories production and in force  revenues  and losses and expenses 

table of contents production and in force below is a summary of new production change change vs 
vs 
in millions  except percentages primary insurance written modified pool insurance written total insurance written primary new insurance written in increased over due to increased production primarily of products with risk adjusted pricing such as alt a loans and arms  including loans with potential negative amortization 
primary new insurance written also increased due to an increase in lender paid transactions  which included  in some cases  products with risk adjusted pricing 
loans with potential negative amortization include pay option arms 
we classify all loans with adjustable interest rates as arms  including those for which the interest rate is fixed for a certain period of time 
we define pay option arms as those that provide a fixed period of time during which the borrower has the option to pay monthly payments that are less than the interest accrued for those months 
if the borrower elects this option  the ltv increases on the loan 
because the ltv can increase on a pay option arm  these types of loans may present more risk to a mortgage insurer than traditional amortizing loans 
we define arms with positive amortization as those that have scheduled loan principal amortization and those for which monthly payments are interest only for a fixed period of time and then convert to scheduled loan principal amortization 
a relatively flat mortgage loan origination market in combined with a decline in the percentage of loan originations for which mortgage insurance was provided caused the decline in primary insurance written in from that of using mica definitions  net new primary insurance written for the entire industry declined approximately for from based on information available from mica and other public sources 
our increased production of products with risk adjusted pricing combined with a gain in market share in mitigated the effects of this industry decline 
we believe that the overall mortgage loan origination market will continue to contract in  which could reduce our primary new insurance written 
however  we believe that alternative credit enhancements such as s  which can limit the need for mortgage insurance  have become less attractive to borrowers as short term interest rates have risen 
further  the recent passing of legislation that makes mortgage insurance tax deductible in certain circumstances may also mitigate any potential reduction of primary insurance written 
we write modified pool insurance only through our structured bulk channel 
structured bulk transactions for the entire industry increased approximately for over  according to information available from mica and other publicly available data 
our modified pool insurance written for increased over as a result of this industry increase and a gain in our market share as shown in the table below 
these same factors caused the increase in modified pool insurance written in over our modified pool insurance written is likely to vary significantly from period to period due to a the limited number of transactions but with larger size occurring in this market  b the level of competition from other mortgage insurers  c the relative attractiveness in the marketplace of mortgage insurance versus other forms of credit enhancement  and d the changing loan composition and underwriting criteria of the market 
we believe there will continue to be opportunities in in the structured bulk transaction market that meet our loan quality and pricing objectives 
the following table provides estimates of our national market share of net new insurance written  using mica definitions  through our flow and structured bulk channels based on information available from mica and other public sources for the years ended december   and flow channel structured bulk channel total 
table of contents our market share of new insurance written through the flow channel increased in and as a result of acquiring business from new lenders and increased writings with our targeted lenders  specifically with special lender paid programs that applied primarily to non prime loans 
these special lender paid programs are competitively priced among mortgage insurers and the production can vary from period to period  depending upon our willingness to accept the specific risk characteristics of these products 
our structured bulk market share will vary from period to period since our share of this market is dependent on the availability and size of transactions that meet our credit quality and pricing benchmarks and on our ability to bid successfully for these transactions 
a significant trend over the last three years in our primary production has been our increased participation in the alt a marketplace 
we have defined alt a loans as individual loans having fico scores greater than and that have been underwritten with reduced or no documentation 
the following table summarizes the credit quality characteristics of our primary new insurance written over the past three years and reflects the growth in our alt a production 
we have defined a minus loans as those loans having fico credit scores greater than  but less than we have defined sub prime loans as those loans with credit scores less than credit quality prime alt a a minus sub prime total another significant trend in our primary production over the past three years was the increase in arms  especially those loans subject to potential negative amortization 
the following table summarizes the loan type characteristics of our primary new insurance written over the past three years and reflects the growth in arms  especially the loans subject to potential negative amortization in loan type fixed arm positive amortization arm potential negative amortization total risk characteristics that we consider in our underwriting discipline also include  among other factors  the ltv of the loan 
the following table summarizes the percentage of our primary production by ltv over the past three years loan to value ltv ratio greater than to and below total ltvs on policies originated in the structured bulk channel are generally lower than those on policies we receive via the flow channel 
those policies generally also have other primary coverage in front of our risk 

table of contents periodically we enter into structured bulk transactions involving loans that have insurance effective dates within the current reporting period but for which detailed loan information regarding the insured loans is not provided by the issuer of the transaction until later 
when this situation occurs  we accrue premiums that are due but not yet paid based upon the estimated commitment amount of the transaction in the reporting period with respect to each loan s insurance effective date 
however  these policies are not reflected in our insurance in force  new insurance written  or related industry data totals until we verify the loan level detail 
at december   we had approximately million of structured transactions with effective dates within for which loan level detail had not been received and  therefore  are not included in our own data or industry totals 
these amounts will be reported as new production and insurance in force totals in  when the issuer of the transactions provides accurate loan level detail to us 
we have included in premium written and premium earned the respective estimated amounts due and earned during related to this insurance 
at december   we had approximately million of structured transactions with effective dates within for which loan level detail had not been received 
the following table provides detail on our direct insurance in force at december   and change change vs 
vs 
in millions  except percentages primary insurance modified pool insurance total insurance our primary insurance in force grew in and in as a result of production during those years and improving persistency rates 
primary insurance annual persistency improved to at december  compared to at december  and at december  if interest rates remain near current levels  we anticipate that persistency rates will also continue near current levels for however  persistency may be adversely affected if interest rates decline significantly from the levels experienced during our modified pool insurance in force grew significantly in and in due to our strong production in the structured bulk channel as well as an improving persistency rate 
approximately  and of our insurance written attributable to our structured bulk channel during   and  respectively  was structured with deductibles that put us in the second loss position 
the declines in modified pool insurance written with deductibles in and were the result of increased business with entities that do not utilize deductibles in their structures  although the use of deductibles remains an effective part of our modified pool risk management strategy 
as mentioned earlier  our modified pool insurance in force is comprised entirely of structured bulk transactions 
although terms vary  the structured bulk market can be broadly categorized into three different segments  or tiers  depending on the risk characteristics of the loans comprising a transaction 
the loan characteristics of the three segments are a predominantly high credit quality  low ltv  fully underwritten loans that may have niche characteristics such as non conforming loan balances and risk concentrations related to geography  transaction purpose  or occupancy type  b loans that generally have high credit quality and low to moderate ltvs that have been underwritten with reduced  streamlined  or no documentation  and c generally fully underwritten loans with credit impaired borrowers fico credit score less than 
in general  we believe that structured bulk business originated in segments b and c will report a higher default rate than our primary business 
however  we also believe that the lower ltvs associated with the structured bulk business originated in segments a and b will ultimately generate lower claim rates as a proportion of the reported defaults and lower levels of severity than primary business 
most of our structured bulk insurance in force is comprised of the first two segments mentioned above  while only approximately of our insurance in force attributable to structured bulk transactions was categorized in segment c above 

table of contents similar to the trend in new insurance written discussed above  alt a continues to grow as a percentage of our insurance in force 
the following table shows the percentage of our insurance in force that we have classified as alt a at december   and primary insurance in force modified pool insurance in force total insurance in force the following table provides information on risk in force at december   and as is evidenced by the following table  we have moved further out on the risk curve based upon the trends in these risk characteristics 
indicators of increased risk would include the following a decline in the percentage of business with prime credit quality an increase in the percentage of alt a business an increase in primary ltv greater than an increase in potential negative amortization loan types an increase in condominium property types a decline in primary residence occupancy status this increase in risk embedded in our portfolio increased the basis points that we charged for mortgage insurance in and

table of contents our book of business is relatively unseasoned  having a weighted average life of years at december  compared to years at december  and years at december  the following table shows direct risk in force as of december   and by year of loan origination 
direct risk direct risk direct risk certificate year in force percent in force percent in force percent in millions  except percentages and before total we offer mortgage insurance structures designed to allow lenders to share in the risks of mortgage insurance 
one such structure is our captive reinsurance program under which a reinsurance company  generally an affiliate of the lender  assumes a portion of the risk associated with the lender s insured book of business in exchange for a percentage of the premium 
the following table shows the percentage of our primary flow channel insurance in force as well as the percentage of our total insurance in force that was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements at december   and primary flow channel insurance in force total insurance in force the growth of the percentage of primary direct insurance in force that was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements in and in was the result of the addition of new lenders that participate in captive reinsurance arrangements as well as increased writings with existing lenders that participate in captive reinsurance arrangements 
the declines in the percentage of total direct insurance in force subject to captive reinsurance in and in reflect the fact that a greater portion of our insurance in force consists of modified pool business 
none of our modified pool insurance in force is subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
we believe captive reinsurance arrangements are an effective risk management tool as selected lenders share in the risk under these arrangements 
additionally  captive reinsurance arrangements are structured so that we receive credit against the capital required in certain risk based capital models utilized by rating agencies 
we remain committed to structuring captive reinsurance arrangements  including deep ceded arrangements where the net premium cede rate is greater than  on a lender by lender basis as we deem it to be prudent depending on a number of considerations including competition  market share and lender quality 
we will continue to be an active participant with our qualified lenders in captive reinsurance arrangements 

table of contents revenues a summary of the individual components of our revenue for the past three years follows change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages direct premium written ceded premium written net premium written change in unearned premiums earned premiums net investment income total revenues we experienced strong growth in earned premiums in both and due to increases in net premium written in both years 
direct premium written is comprised of premium written for both primary and modified pool business 
our growth in total direct premiums written in and was the result of the growth of our insurance in force through the strong production of primary insurance products with risk based pricing as noted previously in the production and in force section as well as growth in our modified pool business 
because of the increased production of products with risk based pricing  the premium rate expressed in terms of basis points on our average primary insurance in force for has risen approximately over additionally  favorable persistency levels increased renewal premium in both years  which is included in direct premium written 
annual persistency was at at december  compared to at december  and at december  ceded premium written is comprised of premiums written under excess of loss reinsurance treaties with captive as well as non captive reinsurance companies 
the growth in ceded premium written in and was not as large as the increase in direct premium written as a result of modified pool business comprising a larger percentage of direct premium written in both years 
further  ceded premium written in was reduced by a no claims bonus on a terminated excess of loss reinsurance treaty of approximately thousand 
the following table provides further data on ceded premiums for the years ended december   and premium cede rate ceded premiums written as a percentage of direct premiums written captive reinsurance premium cede rate ceded premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements as a percentage of direct premiums written average captive premium cede rate ceded premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements as a percentage of direct premiums written under captive reinsurance arrangements the table below provides data on insurance written that was subject to captive reinsurance arrangements for the years ended december   and primary flow insurance written total insurance written the percentage of primary flow insurance written subject to captive reinsurance declined in from due to increased production of certain lender paid programs that were not subject to captive reinsurance arrangements 
the percentage of primary flow insurance written subject to captive reinsurance was relatively flat in compared to the declines in the percentage of total insurance written subject to captive reinsurance in and in is again reflective of the fact that modified pool insurance written comprised a greater portion of our total insurance written in both of these years 

table of contents the difference between net written premiums and earned premiums is the change in the unearned premium reserve  which is established primarily on premiums received on annual products 
our unearned premium liability declined million during compared to a decline of million in and an increase of million during due to fluctuations in the amount and timing of annual premiums received 
assuming no significant decline in interest rates  we expect our persistency will remain near current levels in we anticipate that this should continue to have a positive effect on renewal earned premiums and total earned premiums in net investment income grew in and in primarily due to the growth in average invested assets in both years  partially offset by declines in portfolio yields 
average invested assets at cost or amortized cost grew by in and in as a result of the investment of positive cash flows from operations 
our investment portfolio tax equivalent yield was   and at december   and  respectively 
we expect to see a growth in invested assets in  however  we anticipate a continuing decline in the overall portfolio tax equivalent yield as current interest rates remain below our average portfolio rate 
see further discussion in the investment portfolio section of this document 
net realized investment gains  except for write downs on other than temporarily impaired securities  are the result of our discretionary dispositions of investment securities in the context of our overall portfolio management strategies and are likely to vary significantly from period to period 
we wrote down other than temporarily impaired securities by approximately million in compared to million in and million in see further discussion of impairment write downs in the realized losses and impairments section below 
losses and expenses a summary of the significant individual components of losses and expenses and the year to year percentage changes follows change change vs

in thousands  except percentages net losses and loss adjustment expenses amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs other operating expenses net of acquisition costs deferred loss ratio expense ratio combined ratio net losses and loss adjustment expenses lae for increased over due to growth and seasoning of our insurance in force combined with refinements in the frequency and severity factors utilized in our calculation of our reserves 
these refinements  most of which occurred in the fourth quarter of  were made primarily to reflect a weakening housing market 
the increases in the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs in and are consistent with the growth in that asset balance 
other operating expenses increased in over  reflecting the growth of our insurance in force as well as several key initiatives that have taken place in the discussion below provides more detail on both losses and expenses 
net losses and lae is comprised of the net claims paid and the change in loss reserves 
loss reserves represent our estimate of the ultimate claim costs of those loans reported to us as in default and those loans in default that are in the process of being reported to us 
we will discuss each of these components separately and the impact on our financial results 

table of contents the following table provides detail on paid claims for the years ended december   and change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages paid claims primary insurance modified pool insurance total number of claims paid primary insurance modified pool insurance total average severity of claims paid primary insurance modified pool insurance total total paid claims increased in and in due to the overall growth of the insurance portfolio and the seasoning of our portfolio 
as interest rates dropped to historical lows in and  many borrowers refinanced 
this meant most of the loans originated in years to canceled  and loans originated in and comprised a greater percentage of our total portfolio at the end of historically  the highest anticipated claim frequency period is between years two to five from loan origination 
therefore  paid claims in were disproportionately low compared to the entire size of the portfolio because the portfolio was not seasoned 
the growth in the number and amounts of primary paid claims in and is consistent with aging of the portfolio as a greater percentage of policies are reaching their anticipated highest claim frequency period 
the declines in both the dollar amount and number of paid claims on modified pool insurance in from were due to the seasoning of the business that was structured with deductibles 
during  a greater percentage of modified pool claims filed were on loans that were part of transactions structured with deductibles 
because of these deductibles  a greater percentage of the modified pool claims filed in did not result in a paid claim 
the growth in paid losses in from was impacted by the increase in total average severity shown above 
this increase was reflective of the growth of alt a loans that generally have a larger average loan balance than the rest of our portfolio  resulting in a higher claim payment 
although for the year ended december  average severity remained relatively flat when compared to  we experienced a significant increase in average severity for both primary and modified pool insurance in the fourth quarter of the following table shows the average quarterly severity of paid claims during three months ended september  june  march  december  in thousands average severity primary insurance modified pool insurance total during the first three quarters of  the average severity dropped compared to this was partially the result of the loss mitigation processes implemented during during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant change in our ability to reduce claims through our traditional mitigation processes  which we believe was related to weakness in the housing market 
in many cases  properties on which loans have defaulted are sold during the foreclosure process  which generally reduces our loss 
when the property does not sell prior to foreclosure  we often pay the full amount of our coverage  which we call a full option settlement 
in the fourth 
table of contents quarter of  full option settlements were a larger percentage of our paid claims 
the lack of mitigation opportunities contributed to the increase in severity for the fourth quarter 
as shown in the production and in force section above  we are insuring a larger percentage of mortgages in excess of  claim payments on defaults of these larger mortgages are greater even if coverage percentages remain constant 
claim payments on these larger mortgages also increased severity in the fourth quarter of we expect the average severity will continue to trend upward as the average loan amounts in our portfolio continue to rise and as the housing market continues to experience a general deterioration  which reduces our loss mitigation opportunities 
however  our average severity on paid losses can fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of the relatively small number of claims paid in a given period  especially in regards to our modified pool insurance 
the increase in severity and the further seasoning of the insurance portfolio indicate that paid losses will continue to trend upward in the table below provides the cumulative paid loss ratios by certificate year calculated as direct losses paid divided by direct premiums received  in each case for a particular policy year that have developed through december   and it excludes the effects of reinsurance 
cumulative paid loss ratios as of december certificate year the table above reflects relatively higher cumulative ratios of losses paid to premium received for the through policy years at this stage of development 
this is due  in part  to a large portion of this business refinancing in subsequent years and the resulting lower aggregate level of premium received for these policy years 

table of contents net losses and loss adjustment expenses also include the change in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the following table provides further information about our loss reserves at december   and and the related changes for the years then ended change change vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages primary insurance reserves for reported defaults reserves for defaults incurred but not reported total primary insurance modified pool insurance reserves for reported defaults reserves for defaults incurred but not reported total modified pool insurance reserve for loss adjustment expenses total reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses net increase in reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses the reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses increased in primarily due to refinements in the frequency and severity factors utilized in our reserving methodology based upon the development of claims paid in an increase in the number of reported loans in default also contributed to the increase in the reserve for losses and lae to a lesser extent 
the number of loans in default includes all reported delinquencies that are in excess of two payments in arrears at the reporting date and all reported delinquencies that were previously in excess of two payments in arrears and have not been brought current 
we continually monitor our reserves and claim development 
as new data emerges  we consider its impact on our reserve calculation  and when necessary  refine our estimates 
during and the first three quarters of  we refined our segmentation for the reserve calculation and monitored emerging trends 
these changes resulted in an increase in frequency factors utilized in our reserve calculation  which increased reserves during significantly more than the increase in the number of reserved defaults from december  to december  in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant increase in our paid loss severity due to the deteriorating developments in the housing market as well as changes in our insured portfolio 
after careful evaluation of these items  we determined that it was prudent to significantly increase the severity factors utilized in our reserving methodology to reflect trends in the housing markets that will reduce our opportunity for loss mitigation 
increases in frequency factors also contributed to the increase in reserves during  although the primary factor was an increase in the number of reported defaults at december  from december  a significant portion of this increase in defaults occurred in fema designated areas as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
at december   the number of defaults without deductibles in these areas represented approximately of our total number of defaults without deductibles 
given the unique circumstances surrounding that situation and absent any evidence that these would develop differently  we reserved for these defaults at our normal level 
as a result  we increased reserves approximately million for the hurricane related defaults during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents primary and modified pool insurance defaults without deductibles from these fema designated areas totaled at december  compared to at december  the terms of our coverage exclude any cost or expense related to the repair or remedy of any physical damage to the property collateralizing an insured mortgage loan 
we have not obtained detailed property assessments for the defaults in the fema designated areas 
our exposure could be limited if such assessments demonstrate that there is significant un repaired physical damage to properties securing loans for which we have provided mortgage insurance 
additionally  we believe that many borrowers living in these areas did not make scheduled mortgage payments due to forbearance granted by fannie mae  freddie mac and lenders  even though the individual borrower s financial condition was not significantly impacted 
we continued to reserve for these defaults at our normal level through december  at december  there were reserves of million for defaults in the fema designated areas compared to million at december  the reserve for these defaults has not declined as greatly as the decline in the number of defaults primarily due to the increase in the frequency and severity factors discussed above 
we will continue to monitor this situation as the longer term impacts develop 
the following table shows default statistics as of december   and prior to  information that came in late in the quarter from lenders was considered in our incurred but not reported reserve  but the default counts were not reflected in our default statistics 
during  we included the default information in our statistics and restated the and statistical information below 
the number of loans in default restatement did not have a significant impact on the delinquency ratio 
the table below includes these default counts in the default statistics for all years presented 
total business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default default rate percentage of loans in default excluding deductibles primary insurance number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default modified pool insurance number of insured loans in force number of loans in default with deductibles without deductibles percentage of loans in default percentage of loans in default excluding deductibles primary alt a business number of insured loans in force number of loans in default percentage of loans in default excludes loans written as part of structured bulk transactions with deductibles and defaults on these loans 
included in primary insurance amounts above 
the decline in the default rate for primary insurance at december  from december  is attributable to the strong production during the that has yet to move into the period of highest anticipated default frequency 
during  our number of primary insured loans in force increased approximately 
table of contents compared to a small decline during as this business seasons  we expect default rates to increase 
the increase in the primary insurance default rate at december  from december  was due largely to seasoning of the portfolio 
our modified pool insurance continues to season  and the default rate increased accordingly at december  from december  as shown in the table above  this business is growing rapidly  which will cause fluctuations in the default rate from period to period 
at december   no individual structured bulk transaction with deductibles as part of the structure had incurred total losses that were nearing its individual deductible amount 
we do not provide reserves on modified pool defaults with deductibles until the incurred losses for that specific structured bulk transaction is projected to exceed the deductible 
we have mentioned the increase in our writings of products subject to risk adjusted pricing such as alt a and arms 
the incidence rates of delinquencies on these products typically increase in the second through fourth year following loan origination 
much of the business that we have added subject to risk adjusted pricing  especially those arms that have potential negative amortization  have not yet reached an age where we would expect to see an increase in delinquencies 
we anticipate our number of loans in default for both primary and modified pool insurance will increase as a larger percentage of our insurance in force reaches the period of the highest expected incidence of defaults  especially those newer products subject to risk adjusted pricing 
most of the potential negative amortization arm products that we insure have not yet been subject to rate resets 
these rate resets could significantly increase the borrower s required monthly payment  which we believe increases the risk of default over that of a fixed rate loan 
we also expect default rates to increase  as these products become a larger percentage of our insurance in force 
consequently  we expect reserves will continue to increase 
we are cautious about housing market conditions in certain regions that have recently experienced rapid house price appreciation 
changes in the economic environment could accelerate paid and incurred loss development 
our reserving model incorporates management s judgments and assumptions regarding these factors  however  due to the uncertainty of future premium levels  losses  economic conditions  and other factors that affect earnings  it is difficult to predict the impact of such higher claim frequencies on future earnings 
amortization of dac increased in and  primarily due to growth in the asset balance  partially offset by improved persistency 
a full discussion of the impact of persistency on dac amortization is included in the deferred policy acquisition costs section below 
other operating expenses increased in due to growth in our insurance in force and due to expenses incurred in connection with the organizational changes following the hiring of a new chief executive officer in and a new chief financial officer in because the growth in net premiums written was greater than the growth in expenses  the expense ratio ratio of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses to net premiums written for improved to from for and for our effective tax rate was for compared to for and for the variance in the effective tax rates between years was due primarily to the change in tax preferred interest income on investments as a percentage of pre tax income 
we expect our effective tax rate to remain near current levels  or increase slightly if total pre tax income grows faster than tax preferred income 
significant customers competition within the mortgage insurance industry continues to increase as many large mortgage lenders have limited the number of mortgage insurers with whom they do business 
at the same time  consolidation among national lenders has increased the share of the mortgage origination market controlled by the largest lenders and that has led to further concentrations of business with a relatively small number of lenders 
many of the national lenders allocate primary business to several different mortgage insurers 
these allocations can vary over time 
our strategy is to continue our focus on national lenders while maintaining the productive relationships that we have built with regional lenders 
our ten largest customers were responsible for   and of insurance written through the flow channel during   and  respectively 
in  we had three customers that individually were responsible for more than of insurance written through the flow channel 
in the aggregate  these customers 
table of contents were responsible for of insurance written through the flow channel 
in and  we had two customers that individually were responsible for more than of insurance written through the flow channel 
in the aggregate  these customers were responsible for and of insurance written through the flow channel in and  respectively 
through actively seeking business with other lenders that meet our criteria  we are broadening our customer base in order to limit our concentration among lenders 
the loss of  or considerable reduction in  business from one or more of these significant customers  without a corresponding increase from other lenders  would have an adverse effect on our business 
financial position total assets increased to million at december  over the same date in  primarily the result of positive cash flows from operations 
total liabilities increased to million at december   from million at december   primarily driven by an increase in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses coupled with an increase in deferred tax liabilities 
this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important in the overall understanding of our financial position 
these items include deferred policy acquisition costs  prepaid federal income tax and related deferred income taxes 
the majority of our assets are contained in our investment portfolio 
a separate investment portfolio section follows this financial position section and reviews our investment portfolio  key portfolio management strategies  and methodologies by which we manage credit risk 
deferred policy acquisition costs costs expended to acquire new business are capitalized as dac and recognized as expense over the anticipated premium paying life of the policy in a manner that approximates the estimated gross profits 
we employ a dynamic model that calculates amortization of dac separately for each year of policy origination 
the model relies on assumptions that we make based upon historical industry experience and our own unique experience regarding the annual persistency development of each year of policy origination 
persistency is the most important assumption utilized in determining the timing of reported amortization expense reflected in the income statement and the carrying value of dac on the balance sheet 
a change in the assumed persistency can impact the current and future amortization expense as well as the carrying value on the balance sheet 
our model accelerates dac amortization through a dynamic adjustment when actual persistency for a particular year of policy origination is lower than the estimated persistency originally utilized in the model 
this dynamic adjustment applies only to lower than assumed persistency  and we do not decrease dac amortization below the levels assumed in the model when persistency increases above those levels 
when actual persistency is lower than that assumed in our models  the dynamic adjustment effectively adjusts the estimated policy life utilized in the model to a policy life based upon the current actual persistency 
as seen below  the actual persistency is very close to the persistency assumed in the model as evidenced by the declining impact of the dynamic adjustment 
in addition  the recoverability of dac carrying value on the balance sheet is tested by calculating an estimated future gross profit on the existing book of business and comparing that to the dac balance 
if this comparison indicates a premium deficiency  the dac carrying value is reduced to the extent of that deficiency through a charge to expense 
our dac models separate the costs capitalized and the amortization streams between transactions arising from the structured bulk and flow distribution channels 
generally  structured bulk transactions have significantly lower acquisition costs associated with the production of the business and they also have a shorter original estimated policy life 
we apply the dynamic adjustment to the structured bulk dac models utilizing the same methodology 
at december  and  net unamortized dac relating to structured bulk transactions amounted to and of the total dac asset on the balance sheet 

table of contents the following table shows the dac asset for the previous three years and the effect of persistency on amortization dollar amounts in thousands dac asset balance beginning of year costs capitalized amortization normal amortization dynamic adjustment total amortization balance end of year annual persistency the growth in the normal dac amortization is driven by growth in the dac assets 
improvements in persistency during and decreased dac amortization resulting from the dynamic adjustment 
assuming no significant increases in persistency  we anticipate dac amortization to increase at a rate similar to the growth in the dac asset during see further information on the accounting for dac in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
prepaid federal income taxes and deferred income taxes we purchase ten year non interest bearing united states mortgage guaranty tax and loss bonds tax and loss bonds to take advantage of a special contingency reserve deduction that mortgage guaranty companies are allowed for tax purposes 
we record these bonds on our balance sheet as prepaid federal income taxes 
purchases of tax and loss bonds are essentially a prepayment of federal income taxes that will become due in ten years  when the contingency reserve is released  and the tax and loss bonds mature 
the proceeds from the maturity of the tax and loss bonds are used to fund the income tax payments due in the same year 
prepaid income taxes were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the change from year to year approximates the change in the deferred income tax liability for the year 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences in reporting taxable income in the financial statements and on the tax return 
these cumulative differences are enumerated in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the largest cumulative difference is the special contingency reserve deduction for mortgage insurers mentioned above 
the remainder of the deferred tax liability has primarily arisen from book and tax reporting differences related to dac and unrealized investment gains 
investment portfolio portfolio description our strategy for managing our investment portfolio is to optimize investment returns while preserving capital and liquidity and adhering to regulatory and rating agency requirements 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities  and the majority of these are tax preferred state and municipal bonds 
we have established a formal investment policy that describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
our investment policy and strategies are subject to change depending upon regulatory  economic  and market conditions as well as our existing financial condition and operating requirements  including our tax position 
although we invest for the long term  we classify our debt and equity securities with readily determinable market values as available for sale 
this classification allows us the flexibility to dispose of securities in order to pursue our investment strategy and meet our operating requirements 
investments classified as available for sale are carried on our balance sheet at fair value 
investments without readily determinable market values are classified as other investments and are also carried at fair value 

table of contents the following table shows the growth and diversification of our investment portfolio december  december  amount percent amount percent in thousands  except percentages fixed maturity securities us government obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds mortgage backed bonds total fixed maturities equity securities total available for sale securities other investments short term investments we seek to provide liquidity in our investment portfolio through cash equivalent investments and through diversification and investment in publicly traded securities 
we attempt to maintain a level of liquidity and duration in our investment portfolio consistent with our business outlook and the expected timing  direction  and degree of changes in interest rates 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements that describes the scheduled maturity of our fixed maturity investments 
we also manage risk and liquidity by limiting our exposure on individual securities 
the following table shows the ten largest exposures to an individual creditor  or issuer in the case of equity securities  in our investment portfolio as of december  carrying of total name of creditor value invested assets in thousands  except percentages atlanta  georgia airport state of connecticut state of pennsylvania state of hawaii federal national mortgage association state of utah structured credit holdings plc common stock port of seattle  washington city of chicago  illinois cook county  illinois as shown above  no investment in the securities of any single issuer exceeded of our investment portfolio at december  
table of contents the following table shows the results of our investment portfolio for the last three years in thousands  except percentages average investments at cost or amortized cost pre tax net investment income effective pre tax yield tax equivalent yield to maturity pre tax realized investment gains the drop in the tax equivalent yield to maturity shown above reflects the investment of our cash flows from operations and reinvestment of proceeds from the maturity or call of higher yielding investments at new money rates  which were and are projected to continue to be lower than that of our overall portfolio yield 
we anticipate this trend to continue into unrealized gains and losses the following table summarizes by category our unrealized gains and losses in our securities portfolio at december  cost or gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair cost gains losses value in thousands fixed maturity securities us government obligations state and municipal bonds corporate bonds mortgage backed bonds subtotal  fixed maturities equity securities total securities these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that we will realize 
changing conditions related to specific securities  overall market interest rates  or credit spreads  as well as our decisions concerning the timing of a sale  may impact values we ultimately realize 
we monitor unrealized losses through further analysis according to maturity date  credit quality  individual creditor exposure and the length of time the individual security has continuously been in an unrealized loss position 
of the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturity securities shown above  approximately  related to bonds with a maturity date in excess of ten years 
the largest individual unrealized loss on any one security at december  was approximately  on a bond issued by a government sponsored enterprise with an amortized cost of million 
gross unrealized gains and losses at december  were million and million  respectively 

table of contents credit risk credit risk is inherent in an investment portfolio 
we manage this risk through a structured approach to internal investment quality guidelines and diversification while assessing the effects of the changing economic landscape 
one way we attempt to limit the inherent credit risk in our portfolio is to maintain investments with high ratings 
the following table shows our investment portfolio by credit ratings dollars in thousands 
december  december  amount percent amount percent in thousands  except percentages fixed maturities us treasury and agency bonds aaa aa a bbb bb cc and lower not rated total fixed maturities equities preferred stocks aa a bbb not rated common stocks total equities we regularly review our entire investment portfolio to identify securities that may have suffered impairments in value that will not be recovered  termed potentially distressed securities 
in identifying potentially distressed securities  we screen all securities held with a particular emphasis on those that have a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than 
additionally  as part of this identification process  we utilize the following information length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer in analyzing our potentially distressed securities list for other than temporary impairments  we pay special attention to securities that have been on the list continually for a period greater than six months 
our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value is also considered 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than nine months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment advisors  improving financial performance of the issuer  or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 

table of contents when we conclude that a decline is other than temporary  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses 
we adjust the amortized cost for securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
of the approximate million of gross unrealized losses at december   securities with a fair value to cost or amortized cost ratio of less than had a combined unrealized loss of approximately  information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
the values of securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will the values of securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  our intent to hold certain of these securities may change in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if our intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss changes  and we do not expect the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of disposition  we will write down the security to its fair value in the period that our intent to hold the security changes 
realized losses and impairments realized losses include both write downs of securities with other than temporary impairments and losses from the sales of securities 
we wrote down securities by a total of approximately   and  during   and  respectively  due to other than temporary declines in fair value 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of operating funds consist primarily of premiums written and investment income 
operating cash flow is generally applied to the payment of claims  interest  expenses  and prepaid federal income taxes in the form of tax and loss bonds 
we generated positive cash flow from operating activities of million in compared to million for and million for the increases in cash flow from operating activities reflects the growth in premiums and investment income received  partially offset by increases in paid losses and operating expenses 
positive cash flows are invested pending future payments of claims and expenses 
our business does not routinely require significant capital expenditures other than for enhancements to our computer systems and technological capabilities 
cash flow shortfalls  if any  could be funded through sales of short term investments and other investment portfolio securities 
we have no existing lines of credit due to the sufficiency of the operating funds from the sources described above 
the insurance laws of the state of illinois impose certain restrictions on dividends that an insurance subsidiary can pay the parent company 
these restrictions  based on statutory accounting practices  include requirements that dividends may be paid only out of statutory earned surplus and that limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of the illinois insurance department 
as of december   there have been no dividends paid by the insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
we are considering  among other alternatives  partial funding of the estimated million initial capital required to commence business in canada through a dividend from triad to the parent company 
based upon current canadian capital requirements and possibilities for growth in that market  we anticipate there may be a need for further capital infusions and dividends from triad may be considered 
as of december  there are no specific restrictions or requirements for capital support arrangements between the parent company and triad or its subsidiaries 
we cede business to captive reinsurance affiliates of certain mortgage lenders captives  primarily under excess of loss reinsurance agreements 
generally  reinsurance recoverables on loss reserves and unearned premiums ceded to these captives are backed by trust funds or letters of credit 
total stockholders equity increased to million at december   from million at december  this increase resulted primarily from net income of million and additional 
table of contents paid in capital of million resulting from activity related to share based compensation to employees and the associated tax benefit 
statutory capital  for the purpose of computing the net risk in force to statutory capital ratio  includes both policyholders surplus and the contingency reserve 
the following table provides information regarding our statutory capital position at december  and statutory policyholders surplus statutory contingency reserve total the primary difference between statutory policyholders surplus and equity computed under generally accepted accounting principles is the statutory contingency reserve 
mortgage insurance companies are required to add to the contingency reserve an amount equal to of calendar year earned premiums and retain the reserve for years  even if the insurance is no longer in force 
therefore  a growing company such as triad normally has a greater increase in its contingency reserve rather than in statutory surplus 
the contingency reserve can be released if the loss ratio exceeds 
our loss ratio for exceeded this threshold  and we released approximately million of contingency reserve to surplus 
triad s ability to write insurance depends on the maintenance of its financial strength ratings 
a number of states generally limit triad s risk to capital ratio to to as of december   triad s risk to capital ratio was to as compared to to at december  the risk to capital ratio is calculated using net risk in force as the numerator and statutory capital as the denominator 
net risk in force accounts for risk ceded under reinsurance arrangements  including captive risk sharing arrangements as well as any applicable stop loss limits and deductible amounts 
triad is rated aa by both standard poor s ratings services and fitch ratings and aa by moody s investors service 
s p has not changed its stable rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry that was issued in february of in december  fitch maintained its negative rating outlook for the us private mortgage insurance industry 
currently  fitch  s p  and moody s all report a stable ratings outlook for triad 
a reduction in triad s rating or outlook could adversely affect our operations 
fannie mae has approval requirements for mortgage insurers 
the rules require prior approval by fannie mae for many of triad s activities and new products  allow for other approved types of mortgage insurers rated less than aa  and give fannie mae increased rights to revise the eligibility standards of mortgage insurers 
we have not seen any material impact on our operations and do not see any material impact on our current or future operations as a result of these rules 
however  a material impact could still occur if fannie mae were to begin to utilize mortgage insurers rated below aa or revise eligibility standards of mortgage insurers in a way that would be adverse to triad 
the office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo issued its risk based capital rules for fannie mae and freddie mac in the first quarter of the regulation provides capital guidelines for fannie mae and freddie mac in connection with their use of various types of credit protection counterparties including a more preferential capital credit for insurance from a aaa rated private mortgage insurer than for insurance from a aa rated private mortgage insurer 
the phase in period for ofheo s risk based capital rules is ten years 
we do not believe the new risk based capital rules had an adverse impact on our financial condition or operations through or that these rules will have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition or operations in the future 
however  if the risk based capital rules result in future changes to the preferences of fannie mae and freddie mac regarding their use of the various types of credit enhancements or their choice of mortgage insurers based on their credit rating  our operations and financial condition could be significantly impacted 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations we had no material off balance sheet arrangements at december  we lease office facilities  automobiles  and office equipment under operating leases with minimum lease commitments that range from one to ten years

the establishment of loss reserves is subject to inherent uncertainty and requires significant judgment by management 
the future loss payment periods are estimated based upon historical experience 
market risk exposure fixed maturity securities represented approximately of our invested assets at december  while the fair value of these fixed rate securities generally bears an inverse relationship to changes in prevailing market interest rates  a change in market interest rates would not immediately impact earnings because we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity 
however  a decrease in market interest rates generally will have the effect of initiating an early call provision of those securities possessing such provisions 
the proceeds relating to the early called securities in a decreasing interest rate environment generally are invested in lower yielding investments that would ultimately decrease earnings 
our long term debt matures in with no early call or put provisions and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the fair value of this debt is sensitive to changes in prevailing interest rates  however  a change in rates would not impact earnings 
we believe that a increase or decrease in market interest rates is reasonable for the upcoming year 
a relative increase or decrease in market interest rates that affect our financial instruments would not have a material impact on earnings during the next fiscal year
