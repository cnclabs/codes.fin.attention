item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation and note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
marketing and sales our marketing strategy is based upon the acquisition and the rejuvenation of established consumer brands that possess what we believe to be significant brand value and unrealized potential 
our marketing objective is to increase sales and market share by developing and executing professionally designed  creative and cost effective advertising and promotional programs 
after we acquire a brand  we implement a brand building strategy that uses the brand s existing consumer awareness to maximize sales of current products and provides for brand growth through product innovation 
this brand building process involves the evaluation and enhancement of the existing brand name  the development and introduction of innovative new products and the professional execution of support programs 
to ensure consistent growth  all new product concepts are thoroughly researched before launch and supported by an integrated trade  consumer and advertising effort  although advertising is used selectively 
recognizing that financial resources are limited  we allocate our resources to focus on those brands that we believe have the greatest opportunities for growth and financial success 
brand priorities vary from year to year and generally revolve around new product introductions 
customers our senior management team and dedicated sales force strive to maintain long standing relationships with our top domestic customers  which accounted for approximately of our combined gross sales for and for our sales management team consists of ten people  who focus on our key customer relationships 
we also contract with third party sales management organizations that interface directly with our remaining customers and report directly to members of our sales management team 
we enjoy broad distribution across each of the major retail channels  including mass merchandisers  drug  food  dollar and club stores 
the following table sets forth the percentage of gross sales to our top customers across our five major distribution channels during the most recent three year period percentage of gross sales to top customers channel of distribution mass food drug dollar club other includes estimates for some of our wholesale customers that service more than one distribution channel 
due to the diversity of our product line  we believe that each of these channels is important to our business and we continue to seek opportunities for growth in each channel 
our principal customer relationships include wal mart  walgreens  cvs  target and dollar general 
for  our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our gross sales  while in  our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our gross sales 
no single customer other than wal mart accounted for more than of our gross sales in either of the two most recent fiscal years and none of our other top five customers accounted for less than of our gross sales in either of the two most recent fiscal years 
our top fifteen customers each purchase products from virtually all of our major product lines 
our strong customer relationships and product recognition provide us with a number of important benefits including minimizing slotting fees  facilitating new product introductions  ensuring prominent shelf space and shortening payment time after invoicing 
we believe that management s emphasis on strong customer relationships  speed and flexibility  leading sales technology capabilities  including electronic data interchange  e mail  the internet  integrated retail coverage  consistent marketing support programs and ongoing product innovation will continue to maximize our competitiveness in the increasingly complex retail environment

we have found that contract manufacturing maximizes our flexibility and responsiveness to industry and consumer trends while minimizing the need for capital expenditures 
we select contract manufacturers based on their core competencies and our perception of the best overall value  including factors such as i depth of services  ii the management team  iii manufacturing flexibility  iv regulatory compliance and v competitive pricing 
we also conduct thorough reviews of each potential manufacturer s facilities  quality standards  capacity and financial stability 
we generally only purchase finished products from our manufacturers 
our primary contract manufacturers provide comprehensive services from product development through the manufacturing of finished goods 
they are responsible for such matters as i production planning  ii product research and development  iii procurement  iv production  v quality testing  and vi almost all capital expenditures 
in most instances  we provide our contract manufacturers with guidance in the form of i product development  ii performance criteria  iii regulatory guidance  iv sourcing of packaging materials and v monthly master production schedules 
this management approach results in minimal capital expenditures and maximizes our cash flow  which is reinvested to support our marketing initiatives or used for brand acquisitions and or to repay outstanding indebtedness 
we have relationships with over third party manufacturers 
of those  our top manufacturers produce items that accounted for of our sales for we do not have long term contracts with the manufacturers of products that account for approximately of our sales in the lack of manufacturing agreements for these products exposes us to the risk that the manufacturer could stop producing our products at any time  for any reason or fail to provide us with the level of products we need to meet our customers demands 
should one or more of our manufacturers stop producing product on our behalf  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
at march   our largest suppliers of manufactured goods included i vijon laboratories  ii abbott laboratories  iii kolmar canada  iv procter gamble  v orasure technologies and vi humco holdings 
we enter into manufacturing agreements for a majority of our products by sales volume  each of which vary based on the third party manufacturer and the products being supplied 
these agreements explicitly outline the manufacturer s obligations and product specifications with respect to the brand or brands being produced 
the prices for purchase of products under these agreements are subject to change pursuant to the terms of these agreements due to fluctuations in raw material  packaging and labor costs 
all of our other products are manufactured on a purchase order basis which are generally based on batch sizes and result in no long term obligations or commitments 
warehousing and distribution we receive orders from retailers and or brokers primarily by electronic data interchange  which automatically enters each order into our computer systems and then routes the order to our distribution center 
the distribution center will  in turn  send a confirmation that the order was received  fill the order and ship the order to the customer  while sending a shipment confirmation to us 
upon receipt of the confirmation  we send an invoice to the customer 
we manage product distribution in the mainland united states through one facility located in st 
louis  owned and operated by jacobson arthur wells  inc jacobson arthur wells handles all finished goods storage  as well as the receipt and disposition of customer returns through their warehousing specialists subsidiary wsi  and all customer shipments through their nationwide logistics subsidiary nli 
the storage and handling agreement provides that  for the three year period beginning june  wsi shall provide warehouse services  including without limitation  storage  handling and shipping with respect to our full line of products 
the transportation management agreement provides that  for the three year period beginning august  nli shall provide i complete management services  ii claims administration  iii proof of delivery  iv procurement  v report generation  and vi automation and tariff compliance services with respect to our full line of products 
if wsi or nli abruptly stopped providing storage or logistics services to us  our business operations could suffer a temporary disruption while new service providers are engaged 
we believe this process could be completed quickly and any temporary disruption resulting therefrom would have an insignificant effect on our operating results and financial condition 
however  a serious disruption  such as a flood or fire  to our distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost 
we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times associated with the distribution of our products to our customers during the time required to reopen or replace our distribution center 
as a result  any such serious or prolonged disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
competition the business of selling brand name consumer products in the over the counter healthcare  household cleaning and personal care categories is highly competitive 
these markets include numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers business both in the united states and abroad 
many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on advertising and marketing and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
if this were to occur  our sales  operating results and profitability would be adversely affected 
our principal competitors vary by industry category 
competitors in the over the counter healthcare category include johnson johnson  maker of visine  which competes with our clear eyes and murine brands  mcneill ppc  maker of tylenol sore throat  and procter gamble  maker of vicks  each of which compete with our chloraseptic brand  schering plough  maker of dr 
scholl s  which competes with our compound w and wartner brands  johnson johnson  maker of band aid brand liquid bandage  which competes with our new skin brand  glaxosmithkline  maker of debrox  which competes with our murine brand  sunstar america  inc  maker of gum line of oral care products  as well as dentek oral care  inc  power products  inc 
and ranir llc  each of which markets a dental protector for nighttime teeth grinding  and competes with the doctor s brand 
competitors in the household cleaning category include henkel  maker of soft scrub  and clorox  maker of tilex  each of which competes with our comet brand  clorox s pine sol  which competes with our spic and span brand and m  maker of scotch brite and o cel o  which compete with our chore boy brand 
competitors in the personal care category include johnson johnson  maker of t gel shampoo  and chattem  maker of selsun blue  which compete with our denorex brand  as well as del laboratories  maker of sally hansen  which competes with our cutex brand 
we compete on the basis of numerous factors  including brand recognition  product quality  performance  price and product availability at the retail level 
advertising  promotion  merchandising and packaging  the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on customers buying decisions and  as a result  on our sales 
the structure and quality of our sales force  as well as sell through of our products  affects in store position  wall display space and inventory levels in retail outlets 
if we are unable to maintain the inventory levels and in store positioning of our products in retail stores  our sales and operating results will be adversely affected 
our markets also are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
an increase in the amount of product introductions by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
regulation product regulation the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including the food and drug administration fda  the federal trade commission ftc  the consumer product safety commission cpsc  the environmental protection agency epa  and by various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed and sold 
regulatory matters are overseen by a team with appropriate legal and regulatory experience 
our regulatory and operations teams work closely with our third party manufacturers on quality related matters while we monitor their compliance with fda regulations and perform periodic audits to ensure such compliance 
our management intends to continue this procedure across all of our brands 
this continual evaluation process ensures that our manufacturing processes and products are of the highest quality and in compliance with all known regulatory requirements 
when and if the fda chooses to audit a particular manufacturing facility  we are notified immediately and updated on the progress of the audit as it proceeds 
if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulations  we could become subject to significant claims or penalties  which could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant additional compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
all of our over the counter drug products are regulated pursuant to the fda s monograph system 
the monographs  both tentative and final  set out the active ingredients and labeling indications that are permitted for certain broad categories of over the counter drug products 
when the fda has finalized a particular monograph  it has concluded that a properly labeled product formulation is generally recognized as safe and effective and not misbranded 
a tentative final monograph indicates that the fda has not made a final determination about products in a category to establish safety and efficacy for a product and its uses 
however  unless there is a serious safety or efficacy issue  the fda will typically exercise enforcement discretion and permit companies to sell products conforming to a tentative final monograph until the final monograph is published 
products that comply with either final or tentative final monograph standards do not require pre market approval from the fda 
the company s over the counter device products are regulated by fda through a system which usually involves pre market clearance of new device products 
during the review process  the fda makes an affirmative determination as to the sufficiency of the label directions  cautions and warnings for the devices in question 
in accordance with the federal food  drug and cosmetic act fdc act and fda regulations  the manufacturing processes of our third party drug and device manufacturers must also comply with the fda s current good manufacturing processes cgmps 
the fda inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine if we and our third party manufacturers are complying with cgmps 
other regulations we are also subject to a variety of other regulations in various foreign markets  including regulations pertaining to import export regulations and antitrust issues 
to the extent we decide to commence or expand operations in additional countries  we may be required to obtain an approval  license or certification from the country s ministry of health or comparable agency 
we must also comply with product labeling and packaging regulations that may vary from country to country 
government regulations in both our domestic and international markets can delay or prevent the introduction  or require the reformulation or withdrawal  of some of our products 
our failure to comply with these regulations can result in a product being removed from sale in a particular market  either temporarily or permanently 
in addition  we are subject to ftc and state regulations  as well as foreign regulations  relating to our product claims and advertising 
if we fail to comply with these regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions and the imposition of penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
intellectual property we own a number of trademark registrations and applications in the united states  canada and other foreign countries 
the following are some of the most important registered trademarks we own in the united states chloraseptic  chore boy  clear eyes  cinch  cloverine  comet  compound w  freeze off  compoz  cutex  the doctor s  denorex  dermoplast  essential care  freezone  heet  kerodex  little remedies  longlast  momentum  mosco  murine  new skin  outgro  oxipor  percogesic  prell  simple pad  simplegel  sleep eze  spic and span  wartner  vacuum grip and zincon 
in addition  we have an exclusive royalty bearing license to use the ezo trademark in the united states for the ten year term ending on december   at which time we shall have the right to purchase the trademark for  while we own the us trademark registration for kerodex  we have an obligation to pay royalties to unilever scientific with respect to the manufacture and sale of barrier creams sold in the united states under the kerodex trademark 
this royalty obligation  at of kerodex sales  will continue as long as we make  use or sell products utilizing the kerodex trademark in the united states 
our trademarks and trade names are how we convey that the products we sell are brand name products 
our ownership of these trademarks and trade names allows us to compete based on the value associated with them 
enforcing our proprietary rights in these trademarks and trade names is expensive and if we are not able to effectively enforce our rights  others may be able to dilute our trademarks and trade names and diminish the value associated with our brands  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other intellectual property rights were acquired from procter gamble and abbott laboratories when we acquired the trademarks related to the comet  chloraseptic  clear eyes  murine and prell product lines  however  we did not in all cases obtain title to all of the intellectual property used to manufacture and sell those products 
therefore  we are dependent upon procter gamble  abbott laboratories and other third parties for intellectual property used in the manufacture and sale of certain of our products 
we have granted mf distributions  inc an exclusive license with an option to purchase to sell spic and span and cinch products in canada for a royalty 
in  we assigned our italian trademark applications and registrations for spic and span and cinch to conter  spa  and entered into a concurrent use agreement with conter with respect to such marks 
conter is also a licensee of the spic and span trademark in benelux  portugal  romania and malta 
we have licensed to procter gamble the right to use the comet  spic and span and chlorinol trademarks in the commercial institutional industrial segment in the united states and canada until we have also licensed to procter gamble the comet and chlorinol brands in russia and specified eastern european countries until seasonality the first quarter of our fiscal year typically has the lowest level of revenue due to the seasonal nature of certain of our brands relative to the summer and winter months 
in addition  the first quarter is the least profitable quarter due the increased advertising and promotional spending to support those brands with a summer selling season  such as compound w  wartner and new skin 
the company s advertising and promotional campaigns in the third quarter influence sales in the fourth quarter winter months 
additionally  the fourth quarter typically has the lowest level of advertising and promotional spending as a percent of revenue 
employees we employed individuals as of march  none of our employees are party to collective bargaining agreements

item a 
risk factors the high level of competition in our industry  much of which comes from competitors with greater resources  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the business of selling brand name consumer products in the over the counter healthcare  household cleaning and personal care categories is highly competitive 
these markets include numerous manufacturers  distributors  marketers and retailers that actively compete for consumers business both in the united states and abroad 
many of these competitors are larger and have substantially greater resources than we do  and may therefore have the ability to spend more aggressively on research and development  advertising and marketing  and to respond more effectively to changing business and economic conditions 
if this were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
our principal competitors vary by industry category 
competitors in the over the counter healthcare category include johnson johnson  maker of visine  which competes with our clear eyes and murine brands  mcneill ppc  maker of tylenol sore throat and procter and gamble  maker of vicks  each of which compete with our chloraseptic brand  schering plough  maker of dr 
scholl s  which competes with our compound w and wartner brands  johnson johnson  maker of band aid brand liquid bandage  which competes with our new skin brand  glaxosmithkline  maker of debrox  which competes with our murine brand  sunstar america  inc  maker of gum line of oral care products  as well as dentek oral care  inc  power products  inc 
and ranir llc  each of which markets a dental protector for nighttime teeth grinding  and competes with the doctor s brand 
competitors in the household cleaning category include henkel  maker of soft scrub  and clorox  maker of tilex  each of which competes with our comet brand 
in addition  clorox s pine sol competes with our spic and span brand and m  maker of scotch brite and o cel o  compete with our chore boy brand 
competitors in the personal care category include johnson johnson  maker of t gel shampoo  and chattem  maker of selsun blue which compete with our denorex brand  as well as del laboratories  maker of sally hansen  which competes with our cutex brand 
certain of our product lines that account for a large percentage of our sales have a small market share relative to our competitors 
for example  while clear eyes has a number two market share position of within the allergy redness eye drop segment  its top competitor  visine  has a market share of 
in contrast  certain of our brands with number two market positions have a similar market share relative to our competitors 
for example  compound w has a number two market position of and its top competitor  dr 
scholl s clear away and freeze away  have a market position of 
also  while cutex is the number one brand name nail polish remover with a market share of  non branded  private label nail polish removers account  in the aggregate  for of the market 
finally  while our new skin liquid bandage product has a number one market position of  the size of the liquid bandage market is relatively small  particularly when compared to the much larger bandage category 
see business section on page of this document for information regarding market share calculations 
we compete for customers attention based on a number of factors  including brand recognition  product quality  performance  price and product availability at the retail level 
advertising  promotion  merchandising and packaging  the timing of new product introductions and line extensions also have a significant impact on consumer buying decisions and  as a result  on our sales 
the structure and quality of our sales force  as well as sell through of our products affects in store position  wall display space and inventory levels in retail stores 
if we are unable to maintain the inventory levels and in store positioning of our products in retail stores  our sales and operating results will be adversely affected 
our markets also are highly sensitive to the introduction of new products  which may rapidly capture a significant share of the market 
an increase in the amount of product introductions by our competitors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  competitors may attempt to gain market share by offering products at prices at or below those typically offered by us 
competitive pricing may require us to reduce prices which may result in lost sales or a reduction of our profit margins 
future price adjustments  product changes or new product introductions by our competitors or our inability to react with price adjustments  product changes or new product introductions of our own could result in a loss of market share which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a large portion of our gross sales and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce our gross sales and therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for  our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and of our sales  respectively  while during  our top five and ten customers accounted for approximately and of our sales  respectively 
wal mart  which itself accounted for approximately and in and  respectively  of our sales  is our only customer that accounted for or more of our sales 
we expect that for and future periods  our top five and ten customers  including wal mart  will  in the aggregate  continue to account for a large portion of our sales 
the loss of one or more of our top customers  any significant decrease in sales to these customers  or a significant decrease in our retail display space in any of these customers stores  could reduce our sales  and therefore  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  our business is based primarily upon individual sales orders 
we typically do not enter into long term contracts with our customers 
accordingly  our customers could cease buying products from us at any time and for any reason 
the fact that we do not have long term contracts with our customers means that we have no recourse in the event a customer no longer wants to purchase products from us 
if a significant number of our smaller customers  or any of our significant customers  elect not to purchase products from us  our business  financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected 
our risk of doing business internationally increases as we expand our international footprint 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of our total revenues were attributable to our international business 
we operate in several regions and countries where we have little or no experience  and generally rely on brokers and distributors for the sale of our products 
in addition to the risks associated with political instability  changes in the outlook for economic prosperity in these countries could adversely affect the sales of our products in these countries 
other risks of doing business internationally include changes in the legislative or regulatory requirements of the countries or regions where we do business  currency controls which restrict or prohibit the repatriation of earnings to the united states or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates resulting in unfavorable increases in the price of our products or cause increases in the cost of certain products purchased from our foreign third party manufacturers  regulatory oversight and its impact on our ability to get products registered for sale in certain markets  potential trade restrictions and exchange controls  inability to protect our intellectual property rights in these markets  and increased costs of compliance with general business and tax regulations in these countries or regions 
we depend on third party manufacturers to produce the products we sell 
if we are unable to maintain these manufacturing relationships or fail to enter into additional relationships  as necessary  we may be unable to meet customer demand and our sales and profitability could suffer as a result 
all of our products are produced by third party manufacturers 
our ability to retain our current manufacturing relationships and engage in new relationships is critical to our ability to deliver quality products to our customers in a timely manner 
without adequate supplies of quality merchandise  sales would decrease materially and our business would suffer 
in the event that our primary third party manufacturers are unable or unwilling to ship products to us in a timely manner  we would have to rely on secondary manufacturing relationships or identify and qualify new manufacturing relationships 
we might not be able to identify or qualify such manufacturers for existing or new products in a timely manner and such manufacturers may not allocate sufficient capacity to us in order that we may meet our commitments to customers 
in addition  identifying alternative manufacturers without adequate lead times can compromise required product validation and stability protocol  which may involve additional manufacturing expense  delay in production or product disadvantage in the marketplace 
the consequences of not securing adequate and timely supplies of merchandise would negatively impact inventory levels  sales and gross margins  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  even if our current manufacturers continue to manufacture our products  they may not maintain adequate quality controls  and therefore  may not be able to continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or applicable regulatory requirements 
if we are forced to rely on products of inferior quality  then our brand recognition and customer satisfaction would likely suffer  leading to a reduction in sales 
this sales reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
these manufacturers may also increase the cost of the products we purchase which could adversely affect our margins in the event we are unable to pass along these increased costs to our customers 
a situation such as this could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
at march   we had relationships with over third party manufacturers 
of those  our top manufacturers produced items that accounted for of our sales for we do not have long term contracts with the manufacturers of products that accounted for approximately of our sales for the fact that we do not have long term contracts with these manufacturers means that they could cease manufacturing these products at any time and for any reason  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
disruption in our main distribution center may prevent us from meeting customer demand and our sales and profitability may suffer as a result 
we manage our product distribution in the continental united states through a primary distribution center in st 
louis  missouri 
a serious disruption  such as a flood or fire  to our primary distribution center could damage our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute our products to customers in a timely manner or at a reasonable cost 
we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times during the time required to reopen or replace our primary distribution center 
as a result  any such serious disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
achievement of our strategic objectives requires the acquisition  or potentially the disposition  of certain brands or product lines 
efforts to affect such acquisitions or dispositions may divert our managerial resources away from our business operations 
the majority of our growth has been driven by acquiring other brands and companies 
at any given time  we may be engaged in discussions with respect to possible acquisitions that are intended to enhance our product portfolio  enable us to realize cost savings and further diversify our category  customer and channel focus 
our ability to successfully grow through acquisitions depends on our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisition candidates and to obtain any necessary financing 
these efforts could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations 
if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties achieving  or an inability to achieve  our expected returns  difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage the business  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies throughout our acquired companies  or adverse customer or shareholder reaction to the acquisition 
in addition  an acquisition could adversely affect our operating results as a result of higher interest costs from the acquisition related debt and higher amortization expenses related to the acquired intangible assets 
the diversion of management s attention to pursue acquisitions  or our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies into our business  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in the event that we decide to sell a brand or product line  we may encounter difficulty finding  or be unable to find  a buyer on acceptable terms in a timely manner 
this could cause a delay in our efforts to achieve our strategic objectives 
regulatory matters governing our industry could have a significant negative effect on our sales and operating costs 
in both our us and foreign markets  we are affected by extensive laws  governmental regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints 
such laws  regulations and other constraints exist at the federal  state or local levels in the united states and at analogous levels of government in foreign jurisdictions 
the formulation  manufacturing  packaging  labeling  distribution  importation  sale and storage of our products are subject to extensive regulation by various federal agencies  including i the fda  ii the ftc  iii the cpsc  iv the epa  and by v various agencies of the states  localities and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  distributed  stored and sold 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with those regulations  we could become subject to significant penalties or claims  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or the cessation of product sales and may adversely affect the marketing of our products  resulting in a significant loss of revenues which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in accordance with the fdc act and fda regulations  the manufacturing processes of our third party manufacturers must also comply with the fda s cgmps 
the fda inspects our facilities and those of our third party manufacturers periodically to determine if we and our third party manufacturers are complying with cgmps 
a history of past compliance is not a guarantee that future cgmps will not mandate other compliance steps and associated expense 
if we or our third party manufacturers fail to comply with federal  state or foreign regulations  we could be required to suspend manufacturing operations  modify product formulations or processes  suspend the sale of products with non complying specifications  initiate product recalls  or change product labeling  packaging or advertising or take other corrective action 
any of the foregoing actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  our failure to comply with ftc or any other federal and state regulations  or with similar regulations in foreign markets  that cover our product claims and advertising  including direct claims and advertising by us  may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise materially adversely affect the distribution and sale of our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
product liability claims and related negative publicity could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
we may be required to pay for losses or injuries purportedly caused by our products 
from time to time we have been and may again be subjected to various product liability claims 
claims could be based on allegations that  among other things  our products contain contaminants  include inadequate instructions or warnings regarding their use or inadequate warnings concerning side effects and interactions with other substances 
for example  denorex products contain coal tar which the state of california has determined allegedly causes cancer 
consequently  in order to comply with california law and to mitigate our risks  the denorex packaging contains a warning to that effect 
any product liability claims may result in negative publicity that may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
also  if one of our products is found to be defective we may be required to recall it 
this may result in substantial costs and negative publicity which may adversely affect our sales and operating results 
although we maintain  and require our suppliers and third party manufacturers to maintain  product liability insurance coverage  potential product liability claims may exceed the amount of insurance coverage or potential product liability claims may be excluded under the terms of the policy  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  in the future we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage or we may be required to pay higher premiums and accept higher deductibles in order to secure adequate insurance coverage 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights our ability to compete effectively in the market for our products could be negatively impacted 
the market for our products depends to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our trademarks  trade names and patents 
our trademarks and trade names convey that the products we sell are brand name products 
we believe consumers ascribe value to our brands  some of which are over years old 
we own the material trademark  trade names and patents used in connection with the packaging  marketing and sale of our products 
this ownership is what prevents our competitors or new entrants to the market from using our valuable brand names and technologies 
therefore  trademark  trade name and patent protection is critical to our business 
although most of our material intellectual property is registered in the united states and in applicable foreign countries  we may not be successful in asserting protection 
if we were to lose the exclusive right to use one or more of our intellectual property rights  the loss of such exclusive right could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
other parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights and may thereby dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace 
brand dilution or the introduction of competitive brands could cause confusion in the marketplace and adversely affect the value that our consumers associate with our brands  and thereby negatively impact our sales 
any such infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources  financial or otherwise  to protect these rights through litigation or other means 
in addition  third parties may assert claims against our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to successfully resolve those claims causing us to lose our ability to use our intellectual property that is the subject of those claims 
such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
furthermore  from time to time  we may be involved in litigation in which we are enforcing or defending our intellectual property rights which could require us to incur substantial fees and expenses and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
virtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles 
as our financial statements indicate  virtually all of our assets consist of goodwill and intangibles  principally the trademarks  trade names and patents that we have acquired 
in the event that the value of those assets became impaired or our business is materially adversely affected in any way  we would not have tangible assets that could be sold to repay our liabilities 
as a result  our creditors and investors may not be able to recoup the amount of the indebtedness that they have extended to us or the amount they have invested in us 
we depend on third parties for intellectual property relating to some of the products we sell  and our inability to maintain or enter into future license agreements may result in our failure to meet customer demand  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we have licenses or manufacturing agreements with third parties that own intellectual property eg  formulae  copyrights  trademarks  trade dress  patents and other technology used in the manufacture and sale of certain of our products 
in the event that any such license or manufacturing agreement is terminated as a result of our breach  we may lose the right to use or have reduced rights to use the intellectual property covered by such license or agreement and may have to develop or obtain rights to use other intellectual property 
similarly  our rights could be reduced if the applicable licensor or third party manufacturer fails to maintain the licensed intellectual property because  in such event  our competitors could obtain the right to use the intellectual property without restriction 
if this were to occur  we might not be able to develop or obtain replacement intellectual property in a timely manner 
additionally  any modified products may not be well received by customers 
the consequences of losing the right to use or having reduced rights to such intellectual property could negatively impact our sales due to our failure to meet consumer demand for the affected products or require us to incur costs for development of new or different intellectual property  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  development of replacement products may be time consuming and ultimately may not be feasible 
we depend on our key personnel and the loss of the services provided by any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business and results of operations 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
these employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
we may not be able to successfully retain existing personnel or identify  hire and integrate new personnel 
while we believe we have developed depth and experience among our key personnel  our business may be adversely affected if one or more of these key individuals were to leave 
we do not maintain any key man or similar insurance policies covering any of our senior management or key personnel 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and the significant amount of cash we need to service our debt will not be available to reinvest in our business 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
at march   our total indebtedness  including current maturities  is approximately million 
additionally  we have the ability to borrow up to million pursuant to our senior credit facility and an additional million pursuant to our revolving credit facility 
our substantial indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds on favorable terms or at all 
the terms of the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes and the senior credit facility allow us to issue and incur additional debt upon satisfaction of conditions set forth in the respective agreements 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the related risks described above could increase 
our operating flexibility is limited in significant respects by the restrictive covenants in our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes impose restrictions that could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions by limiting our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business and industry 
specifically  these restrictions limit our ability to  among other things borrow money or issue guarantees  pay dividends  repurchase stock from or make other restricted payments to stockholders  make investments  use assets as security in other transactions  sell assets or merge with or into other companies  enter into transactions with affiliates  sell stock in our subsidiaries  and direct our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to our company 
our ability to engage in these types of transactions is generally limited by the terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  even if we believe that a specific transaction would positively contribute to our future growth  operating results or profitability 
however  if we are able to enter into these types of transactions under the terms of the senior credit facility and the indenture  or if we obtain a waiver with respect to any specific transaction  that transaction may cause our indebtedness to increase  may not result in the benefits we anticipate or may cause us to incur greater costs or suffer greater disruptions in our business than we anticipate  and could therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
in addition  the senior credit facility requires us to maintain certain leverage  interest and fixed charge coverage ratios 
although we believe we are on track to meet and or maintain the financial ratios contained in our credit agreement  our ability to do so may be affected by events outside our control 
covenants in our senior credit facility also require us to use of the proceeds we receive from debt issuances to repay outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility 
any failure by us to comply with the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain cross default provisions that may result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness 
the senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes contain provisions that allow the respective creditors to declare all outstanding borrowings under one agreement to be immediately due and payable as a result of a default under the other agreement 
consequently  under the senior credit facility  failure to make a payment required by the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  among other things  may lead to an event of default under the senior credit facility 
similarly  an event of default or failure to make a required payment at maturity under the senior credit facility  among other things  may lead to an event of default under the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes 
if the debt under the senior credit facility and indenture governing the senior subordinated notes were to both be accelerated  the aggregate amount immediately due and payable as of march  would have been approximately million 
we presently do not have sufficient liquidity to repay these borrowings in the event they were to be accelerated  and we may not have sufficient liquidity in the future to do so 
additionally  we may not be able to borrow money from other lenders to enable us to refinance the indebtedness 
at march   the book value of our current assets was million 
although the book value of our total assets was  million  approximately million was in the form of intangible assets  including goodwill of million  a significant portion of which are illiquid and may not be available to satisfy our creditors in the event our debt is accelerated 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of the senior credit facility  the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default 
such default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt  as well as any other debt to which the cross acceleration or cross default provisions apply 
in addition  the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with additional funding 
as a result  any default by us under our credit agreement  indenture governing the senior subordinated notes or any other financing agreement  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees  consumers  suppliers  stockholders or others through private actions  class actions  administrative proceedings  regulatory actions or other litigation 
the outcome of litigation  particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions  is difficult to assess or quantify 
plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts  and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time 
the cost to defend current and future litigation may be significant 
there may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of our products  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable 
as a result  litigation may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to several factors  some of which are beyond our control  including i general stock market volatility  ii variations in our quarterly operating results  iii our leveraged financial position  iv potential sales of additional shares of our common stock  v general trends in the consumer products industry  vi changes by securities analysts in their estimates or investment ratings  vii the relative illiquidity of our common stock and viii news regarding litigation in which we are or become involved 
our principal stockholders have the ability to significantly influence our business  which may be disadvantageous to other stockholders and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
entities affiliated with gtcr collectively own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to exert substantial influence over all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other corporate transactions 
under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  the gtcr entities and non employee directors will not have any duty to refrain from engaging directly or indirectly in the same or similar business activities or lines of business that we do 
in the event that any gtcr entity or non employee director  as the case may be  acquires knowledge of a potential transaction or matter which may be a corporate opportunity for itself and us  the gtcr entity or non employee director  as the case may be  will not have any duty to communicate or offer such corporate opportunity to us and may pursue such corporate opportunity for itself or direct such corporate opportunity to another person 
this concentration of stock ownership also may make it difficult for stockholders to replace management 
in addition  this significant concentration of stock ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with stockholders who own significant blocks of stock 
this concentration of control could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of our officers  directors and principal stockholders and the trading price of shares of our common stock could be adversely affected 
substantial sales of our common stock by either our controlling stockholder or management or the perception that these sales could occur could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by gtcr or management  or the perception that these sales could occur  could adversely affect the price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
pursuant to an agreement with gtcr  we filed a registration statement on form s form s with the sec in december while the form s has yet to be declared effective by the sec  once effective  our controlling stockholder will have the ability to sell common stock  up to the maximum number of common shares registered  into the public marketplace 
such a sale could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
we have no current intention of paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
we presently intend to retain our earnings  if any  for use in our operations  to facilitate strategic acquisitions  or to repay our outstanding indebtedness and have no current intention of paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
in addition  our debt instruments limit our ability to declare and pay cash dividends on our common stock 
as a result  your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a profit 
our annual and quarterly results from operations may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  resulting in a decline in the price of our securities 
our annual and quarterly results from operations may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including increases and decreases in average quarterly revenues and profitability  the rate at which we make acquisitions or develop new products and successfully market them  our inability to increase the sales of our existing products and expand their distribution  changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions  including the effects of competitors operational  promotional or expansion activities  seasonality of our products  fluctuations in commodity prices  product costs  utilities and energy costs  prevailing wage rates  insurance costs and other costs  our ability to recruit  train and retain qualified employees  and the costs associated with those activities  changes in advertising and promotional activities and expansion to new markets  negative publicity relating to us and the products we sell  unanticipated increases in infrastructure costs  impairment of goodwill or long lived assets  changes in interest rates  and changes in accounting  tax  regulatory or other rules applicable to our business 
our quarterly operating results and revenues may fluctuate as a result of any of these or other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and revenues for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our securities could decrease 
we can be affected adversely and unexpectedly by the implementation of new  or changes in the interpretation of existing  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our financial reporting complies with gaap  and gaap is subject to change over time 
if new rules or interpretations of existing rules require us to change our financial reporting  our financial condition and results from operations could be adversely affected 
identification of material weakness in internal controls over financial reporting may adversely affect our financial results 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of those provisions provide for the identification and reporting of material weaknesses in our system of internal controls over financial reporting 
if such a material weakness is identified  it could indicate a lack of controls adequate to generate accurate financial statements 
we routinely assess our internal controls over financial reporting  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to timely remediate any material weaknesses that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
likewise  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may discourage potential acquirers of our company  which could adversely affect the value of our securities 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our board of directors is authorized to issue from time to time  without further stockholder approval  up to million shares of preferred stock in one or more series of preferred stock issuances 
our board of directors may establish the number of shares to be included in each series of preferred stock and determine  as applicable  the voting and other powers  designations  preferences  rights  qualifications  limitations and restrictions for such series of preferred stock 
the shares of preferred stock could have preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends and liquidation rights 
we may issue additional preferred stock in ways which may delay  defer or prevent a change in control of the company without further action by our stockholders 
the shares of preferred stock may be issued with voting rights that may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock by increasing the number of outstanding shares having voting rights  and by the creation of class or series voting rights 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains additional provisions that may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or attempt to acquire control of our company 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions of delaware law that limit  in some cases  our ability to engage in certain business combinations with significant stockholders 
these provisions  either alone  or in combination with each other  give our current directors and executive officers the ability to significantly influence the outcome of a proposed acquisition of the company 
these provisions would apply even if an acquisition or other significant corporate transaction was considered beneficial by some of our stockholders 
if a change in control or change in management is delayed or prevented by these provisions  the market price of our securities could decline

the company s management believes the remaining claims are legally deficient and subject to meritorious defenses 
the company intends to vigorously pursue its defenses  however  the company cannot reasonably estimate the potential range of loss  if any 
on may   similasan corporation filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the district of colorado in which similasan alleged false designation of origin  trademark and trade dress infringement  and deceptive trade practices by the company related to murine for allergy eye relief  murine for tired eye relief and murine for earache relief  as applicable 
similasan has requested injunctive relief  an accounting of profits and damages and litigation costs and attorneys fees 
in response  the company filed an answer to the complaint with a potentially dispositive motion 
in addition to the lawsuit filed by similasan in the us district court for the district of colorado  the company also received a cease and desist letter from swiss legal counsel to similasan and its parent company  similasan ag  a swiss company 
in the cease and desist letter  similasan and similasan ag have alleged a breach of the secrecy agreement executed by the company and demanded that the company cease and desist from i using confidential information covered by the secrecy agreement  and ii manufacturing  distributing  marketing or selling certain of its homeopathic products 
the complaint in the colorado action has been amended to include allegations relating to the breach of confidentiality and the company has filed an answer and responsive motions 
on february   prior to the court s issuance of a decision regarding the pending motions  the company agreed to a settlement of the litigation with similasan and similasan ag and executed a settlement agreement 
the terms of the settlement agreement involved a dismissal of the litigation with prejudice and no monetary damages to the company 
on september   orasure technologies  inc moved in the supreme court of the state of new york for a preliminary injunction prohibiting the company from selling cryogenic wart removal products under the wartner brand  which the company acquired on september  orasure technologies is a supplier to the company for the company s compound w freeze off business 
the distribution agreement between the parties provides for mediation of contract disputes  followed by arbitration  if necessary 
the contract in question is of five years duration ending in december on october   the court denied orasure technologies motion for a preliminary injunction 
subsequently  in a decision and order dated december   the court denied a motion by orasure technologies for a rehearing regarding a preliminary injunction 
an appeal was filed by orasure in the appellate division of the supreme court of the state of new york on january   and the company filed a brief with the court on february  on may   the appellate division reversed the decision of the supreme court of the state of new york and issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting the marketing and selling of the wartner brand by the company until the underlying arbitration with orasure was concluded 
on may   the company requested that the appellate division issue a stay of the preliminary injunction  consider reargument of the appellate division s decision and grant a leave to appeal to the court of appeals of the state of new york 
in response to the company s request for a stay of the preliminary injunction  the appellate division issued a stay of the preliminary injunction pending the appellate division s consideration of the company s motion to reargue and request for leave to appeal to the court of appeals 
the parties are currently awaiting the decision of the appellate division regarding the motions made by the company 
the company believes the preliminary injunction was granted based upon factual and legal error and is inconsistent with the terms of the distribution agreement with orasure and applicable law 
the company is also seeking resolution of the matter through arbitration as required pursuant to the distribution agreement 
a hearing before the arbitration panel is scheduled to be held in august the company is also involved from time to time in other routine legal matters and other claims incidental to its business 
the company reviews outstanding claims and proceedings internally and with external counsel as necessary to assess probability and amount of potential loss 
these assessments are re evaluated at each reporting period and as new information becomes available to determine whether a reserve should be established or if any existing reserve should be adjusted 
the actual cost of resolving a claim or proceeding ultimately may be substantially different than the amount of the recorded reserve 
in addition  because it is not permissible under generally accepted accounting principles to establish a litigation reserve until the loss is both probable and estimable  in some cases there may be insufficient time to establish a reserve prior to the actual incurrence of the loss upon verdict and judgment at trial  for example  or in the case of a quickly negotiated settlement 
the company believes the resolution of routine matters and other incidental claims  taking into account reserves and insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results from operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis may contain forward looking statements that involve certain risks  assumptions and uncertainties 
future results could differ materially from the discussion that follows for many reasons  including the factors described in item a  risk factors in this annual report on form k  as well as those described in future reports filed with the sec 
general we are engaged in the marketing  sales and distribution of brand name over the counter healthcare  household cleaning and personal care products to mass merchandisers  drug stores  supermarkets and club stores primarily in the united states and canada 
we operate in niche segments of these categories where we can use the strength of our brands  our established retail distribution network  a low cost operating model and our experienced management team as a competitive advantage to grow our presence in these categories and  as a result  grow our sales and profits 
we have grown our brand portfolio by acquiring strong and well recognized brands from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies  as well as other brands from smaller private companies 
while the brands we have purchased from larger consumer products and pharmaceutical companies have long histories of support and brand development  we believe that at the time we acquired them they were considered non core by their previous owners and did not benefit from the focus of senior level management or strong marketing support 
we believe that the brands we have purchased from smaller private companies have been constrained by the limited resources of their prior owners 
after acquiring a brand  we seek to increase its sales  market share and distribution in both existing and new channels 
we pursue this growth through increased spending on advertising and promotion  new marketing strategies  improved packaging and formulations and innovative new products 
in february  we raised million through an initial public offering ipo of million shares of common stock 
the net proceeds of the offering were million after deducting million of underwriters fees and million of offering expenses 
the net proceeds of million plus million from our revolving credit facility and million of cash on hand went to repay million of our existing senior indebtedness plus a repayment premium of million and accrued interest of million  to redeem million in aggregate principal amount of our existing senior subordinated notes plus a redemption premium of million and accrued interest of million  to repurchase an aggregate of million shares of our common stock held by the gtcr funds and the tcw crescent funds for million  and to contribute million to our subsidiary  prestige international holdings  llc  which was used to redeem all of its outstanding senior preferred units and class b preferred units 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of million shares by the selling stockholders as a result of underwriters exercising their over allotment options 
in october  we completed the acquisition of the chore boy brand of cleaning pads and sponges 
the purchase price of this acquisition was million  including direct costs of  we purchased the chore boy brand with funds generated from operations 
in november  we completed the acquisition of dental concepts llc  a marketer of therapeutic oral care products sold under the doctor s brand 
the adjusted purchase price of the ownership interests was approximately million  including fees and expenses of the acquisition of million 
we financed the acquisition price through the utilization of our revolving credit facility in the amount of million and cash on hand 
in september  we completed the acquisition of wartner usa bv  a privately held netherlands limited liability company  which owned the intellectual property associated with the wartner brand of over the counter wart treatment products 
the purchase price of this acquisition was million  inclusive of direct costs of the acquisition of  we purchased the wartner brand with funds generated from operations and the assumption of approximately million of contingent payments to the former owner of the wartner brand 
impact of purchase accounting the acquisitions of medtech  spic and span  bonita bay  vetco  dental concepts and wartner usa have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations statement no 

as a result  these acquisitions will affect our future results of operations in significant respects 
the aggregate acquisition consideration has been allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed by us based upon their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
a significant portion of the acquisition consideration was allocated to amortizable intangible assets which results in amortization expense in the periods following the acquisitions 
in addition  our borrowing to finance these acquisitions has resulted  and will continue to result in significant interest costs until such time that the debt obligations are repaid 
for additional information  see liquidity and capital resources contained in this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the audited financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
while all significant accounting policies are important to our consolidated financial statements  certain of these policies may be viewed as being critical 
such policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results from operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses or the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates are based upon our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different conditions 
the most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we comply with the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which states that revenue should be recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we have determined that the transfer of risk of loss generally occurs when product is received by the customer  and  accordingly recognize revenue at that time 
provision is made for estimated discounts related to customer payment terms and estimated product returns at the time of sale based on our historical experience 
as is customary in the consumer products industry  we participate in the promotional programs of our customers to enhance the sale of our products 
the cost of these promotional programs is recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products as either advertising and promotional expenses or as a reduction of sales 
such costs vary from period to period based on the actual number of units sold during a finite period of time 
we estimate the cost of such promotional programs at their inception based on historical experience and current market conditions and reduce sales by such estimates 
these promotional programs consist of direct to consumer incentives such as coupons and temporary price reductions  as well as incentives to our customers  such as slotting fees and cooperative advertising 
we do not provide incentives to customers for the acquisition of product in excess of normal inventory quantities since such incentives increase the potential for future returns  as well as reduce sales in the subsequent fiscal periods 
estimates of costs of promotional programs are based on i historical sales experience  ii the current offering  iii forecasted data  iv current market conditions  and v communication with customer purchasing marketing personnel 
at the completion of the promotional program  the estimated amounts are adjusted to actual results 
while our promotional expense for the year ended march  was million  we participated in  promotional campaigns  resulting in an average cost of  per campaign 
of such amount  only payments were in excess of  we believe that the estimation methodologies employed  combined with the nature of the promotional campaigns  makes the likelihood remote that our obligation would be misstated by a material amount 
however  for illustrative purposes  had we underestimated the promotional program rate by for the year ended march   our sales and operating income would have been adversely affected by approximately million 
net income would have been adversely affected by approximately million 
we also periodically run coupon programs in sunday newspaper inserts or as on package instant redeemable coupons 
we utilize a national clearing house to process coupons redeemed by customers 
at the time a coupon is distributed  a provision is made based upon historical redemption rates for that particular product  information provided as a result of the clearing house s experience with coupons of similar dollar value  the length of time the coupon is valid  and the seasonality of the coupon drop  among other factors 
during the year ended march   we had coupon events 
the amount recorded against revenues and accrued for these events during the year was million  of which million was redeemed during the year 
allowances for product returns due to the nature of the consumer products industry  we are required to estimate future product returns 
accordingly  we record an estimate of product returns concurrent with the recording of sales 
such estimates are made after analyzing i historical return rates  ii current economic trends  iii changes in customer demand  iv product acceptance  v seasonality of our product offerings  and vi the impact of changes in product formulation  packaging and advertising 
we construct our returns analysis by looking at the previous year s return history for each brand 
subsequently  each month  we estimate our current return rate based upon an average of the previous six months return rate and review that calculated rate for reasonableness giving consideration to the other factors described above 
our historical return rate has been relatively stable  for example  for the years ended march   and  returns represented   and  respectively  of gross sales 
at march  and  the allowance for sales returns was million and million  respectively 
while we utilize the methodology described above to estimate product returns  actual results may differ materially from our estimates  causing our future financial results to be adversely affected 
among the factors that could cause a material change in the estimated return rate would be significant unexpected returns with respect to a product or products that comprise a significant portion of our revenues 
based upon the methodology described above and our actual returns experience  management believes the likelihood of such an event is remote 
as noted  over the last three years  our actual product return rate has stayed within a range of to of gross sales 
an increase of in our estimated return rate as a percentage of gross sales would have adversely affected our reported sales and operating income for the year ended march  by approximately  net income would have been adversely affected by approximately  allowances for obsolete and damaged inventory we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
accordingly  we reduce our inventories for the diminution of value resulting from product obsolescence  damage or other issues affecting marketability equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
factors utilized in the determination of estimated market value include i current sales data and historical return rates  ii estimates of future demand  iii competitive pricing pressures  iv new product introductions  v product expiration dates  and vi component and packaging obsolescence 
many of our products are subject to expiration dating 
as a general rule our customers will not accept goods with expiration dating of less than months from the date of delivery 
to monitor this risk  management utilizes a detailed compilation of inventory with expiration dating between zero and months and reserves for of the cost of any item with expiration dating of months or less 
at march  and  the allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory represented and  respectively  of total inventory 
the year over year increase resulted primarily from obsolescence reserves related to products in the cough and cold category facing expiration dating 
inventory obsolescence costs charged to operations for the years ended march    and were   and of net sales  respectively 
a increase in our allowance for obsolescence at march  would have adversely affected our reported operating income and net income for the year ended march  by approximately  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts in the ordinary course of business  we grant non interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which is based upon our historical collection experience and expected collectibility of the accounts receivable 
in an effort to reduce our credit risk  we i establish credit limits for all of our customer relationships  ii perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition  iii monitor the payment history and aging of our customers receivables  and iv monitor open orders against an individual customer s outstanding receivable balance 
we establish specific reserves for those accounts which file for bankruptcy  have no payment activity for days or have reported major negative changes to their financial condition 
the allowance for bad debts at march  and amounted to and  respectively  of accounts receivable 
bad debt expense recoveries for  and were   and  respectively  each representing of net sales in each of the years 
while management believes that it is diligent in its evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  an unexpected event  such as the bankruptcy filing of a major customer  could have an adverse effect on our future financial results 
a increase in our bad debt expense as a percentage of sales in would have resulted in a decrease in reported operating income of approximately  and a decrease in our reported net income of approximately  valuation of intangible assets and goodwill goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million and million at march  and  respectively 
at march   goodwill and intangible assets were apportioned among our three operating segments as follows over the counter healthcare household cleaning personal care consolidated goodwill intangible assets indefinite lived finite lived our clear eyes  new skin  chloraseptic  compound w and wartner brands comprise the majority of the value of the intangible assets within the over the counter healthcare segment 
denorex  cutex and prell comprised substantially all of the intangible asset value within the personal care segment 
the comet  spic and span and chore boy brands comprise substantially all of the intangible asset value within the household cleaning segment 
goodwill and intangible assets comprise substantially all of our assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
intangible assets generally represent our trademarks  brand names and patents 
when we acquire a brand  we are required to make judgments regarding the value assigned to the associated intangible assets  as well as their respective useful lives 
management considers many factors  both prior to and after  the acquisition of an intangible asset in determining the value  as well as the useful life  assigned to each intangible asset that the company acquires or continues to own and promote 
the most significant factors are brand history a brand that has been in existence for a long period of time eg   or years generally warrants a higher valuation and longer life sometimes indefinite than a brand that has been in existence for a very short period of time 
a brand that has been in existence for an extended period of time generally has been the subject of considerable investment by its previous owner s to support product innovation and advertising and promotion 
market position consumer products that rank number one or two in their respective market generally have greater name recognition and are known as quality product offerings  which warrant a higher valuation and longer life than products that lag in the marketplace 
recent and projected sales growth recent sales results present a snapshot as to how the brand has performed in the most recent time periods and represent another factor in the determination of brand value 
in addition  projected sales growth provides information about the strength and potential longevity of the brand 
a brand that has both strong current and projected sales generally warrants a higher valuation and a longer life than a brand that has weak or declining sales 
similarly  consideration is given to the potential investment  in the form of advertising and promotion  which is required to reinvigorate a brand that has fallen from favor 
history of and potential for product extensions consideration also is given to the product innovation that has occurred during the brand s history and the potential for continued product innovation that will determine the brand s future 
brands that can be continually enhanced by new product offerings generally warrant a higher valuation and longer life than a brand that has always followed the leader 
after consideration of the factors described above  as well as current economic conditions and changing consumer behavior  management prepares a determination of the intangible s value and useful life based on its analysis of the requirements of statements no 
and no 
under statement no 
 goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but must be tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and must also be tested for impairment 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if conditions indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered  management performs a review of both the values and useful lives assigned to goodwill and intangible assets and tests for impairment 
finite lived intangible assets as mentioned above  management performs a review annually  or more frequently if necessary  to ascertain the impact of events and circumstances on the estimated useful lives and carrying values of our trademarks and trade names 
in connection with this analysis  management reviews period to period sales and profitability by brand  analyzes industry trends and projects brand growth rates  prepares annual sales forecasts  evaluates advertising effectiveness  analyzes gross margins  reviews contractual benefits or limitations  monitors competitors advertising spend and product innovation  prepares projections to measure brand viability over the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  and considers the regulatory environment  as well as industry litigation 
should analysis of any of the aforementioned factors warrant a change in the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  management will reduce the estimated useful life and amortize the carrying value prospectively over the shorter remaining useful life 
management s projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts  circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life 
in the event that the long term projections indicate that the carrying value is in excess of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the intangible assets  management is required to record an impairment charge 
once that analysis is completed  a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value 
the impairment charge is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the intangible asset over fair value as calculated using the discounted cash flow analysis 
future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
indefinite lived intangible assets in a manner similar to finite lived intangible assets  on an annual basis  or more frequently if necessary  management analyzes current events and circumstances to determine whether the indefinite life classification for a trademark or trade name continues to be valid 
should circumstance warrant a finite life  the carrying value of the intangible asset would then be amortized prospectively over the estimated remaining useful life 
in connection with this analysis  management also tests the indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment by comparing the carrying value of the intangible asset to its estimated fair value 
since quoted market prices are seldom available for trademarks and trade names such as ours  we utilize present value techniques to estimate fair value 
accordingly  management s projections are utilized to assimilate all of the facts  circumstances and expectations related to the trademark or trade name and estimate the cash flows over its useful life 
in performing this analysis  management considers the same types of information as listed above in regards to finite lived intangible assets 
once that analysis is completed  a discount rate is applied to the cash flows to estimate fair value 
future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
goodwill as part of its annual test for impairment of goodwill  management estimates the discounted cash flows of each reporting unit  which is at the brand level  and one level below the operating segment level  to estimate their respective fair values 
in performing this analysis  management considers the same types of information as listed above in regards to finite lived intangible assets 
in the event that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  management would then be required to allocate the estimated fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the unit was acquired in a business combination  thereby revaluing the carrying amount of goodwill 
in a manner similar to indefinite lived assets  future events  such as competition  technological advances and reductions in advertising support for our trademarks and trade names could cause subsequent evaluations to utilize different assumptions 
in estimating the value of trademarks and trade names  as well as goodwill  at march   management applied a discount rate of  the company s then current weighted average cost of funds  to the estimated cash flows  however that rate  as well as future cash flows may be influenced by such factors  including i changes in interest rates  ii rates of inflation  or iii sales or contribution margin reductions 
in the event that the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of either intangible assets or goodwill  we would be required to recognize an impairment charge 
additionally  continued decline of the fair value ascribed to an intangible asset or a reporting unit caused by external factors may require future impairment charges 
during the three month period ended march   we recorded non cash charges related to the impairment of intangible assets and goodwill of the personal care segment of million and million  respectively  because the carrying amounts of these branded assets exceeded their fair market values primarily as a result of declining sales caused by product competition 
should the related fair values of goodwill and intangible assets continue to be adversely affected as a result of declining sales or margins caused by competition  technological advances or reductions in advertising and promotional expenses  the company may be required to record additional impairment charges 
we were not required to record any asset impairment charges during the year ended march  stock based compensation during  we adopted fasb statement no 
r  share based payment statement no 
r with the initial grants of restricted stock and options to purchase common stock to employees and directors in accordance with the provisions of the plan 
statement no 
r requires us to measure the cost of services to be rendered based on the grant date fair value of the equity award 
compensation expense is to be recognized over the period which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  generally referred to as the requisite service period 
information utilized in the determination of fair value includes the following type of instrument ie restricted shares vs 
an option  warrant or performance shares  strike price of the instrument  market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant  discount rates  duration of the instrument  and volatility of the company s common stock in the public market 
additionally  management must estimate the expected attrition rate of the recipients to enable it to estimate the amount of non cash compensation expense to be recorded in our financial statements 
while management uses diligent analysis to estimate the respective variables  a change in assumptions or market conditions  as well as changes in the anticipated attrition rates  could have a significant impact on the future amounts recorded as non cash compensation expense 
the company recorded non cash compensation expense of  and  during and  respectively 
assuming no changes in assumptions and no awards authorized by the compensation committee of the board of directors during  we will record non cash compensation expense of approximately  there were no stock based compensation charges incurred during loss contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such loss is reasonable estimable 
contingent losses are often resolved over longer periods of time and involve many factors including rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies  sufficiency of the evidence in support of our position  anticipated costs to support our position  and likelihood of a positive outcome
