item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
background since we commenced operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the identification  development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with ms  sci and other disorders of the cns 
our marketed drug  zanaflex capsules  is fda approved for the management of spasticity 
we announced positive results from a phase clinical trial of our lead product candidate  fampridine sr  for the improvement of walking ability in people with ms in september  and we plan to initiate an additional phase clinical trial of fampridine sr in people with ms in the second quarter of our preclinical programs also target ms and sci  as well as other cns disorders  including stroke and traumatic brain injury 
from until mid  we were engaged almost exclusively in the in licensing of compounds and the preclinical and clinical development of these compounds 
we licensed the rights to fampridine sr from elan for the treatment of sci in in september  we entered into an amended license agreement with elan that granted us exclusive worldwide rights to fampridine sr in return for the payment of royalties and milestones 
in addition  we entered into a supply agreement under which elan provides fampridine sr based upon an agreed upon price schedule 
we have expended a significant portion of our funds on a number of clinical trials for fampridine sr  our most advanced product candidate  including two phase clinical trials of fampridine sr in sci and a phase and a phase clinical trial in ms  the results of which were announced in april and september  respectively 
in september we announced positive results from the phase clinical trial of our lead product candidate  fampridine sr in ms 
statistical significance was achieved on all three efficacy criteria defined by the fda in the special protocol assessment spa 
we plan to initiate a second phase clinical trial in the second quarter of an earlier phase clinical trial in ms was completed in in mid  we decided to put our clinical trials of fampridine sr in sci on hold  and refocused our efforts on our ongoing fampridine sr in ms program  leading to our recently completed phase clinical trial of fampridine sr for improvement of walking ability in people with ms 
we may resume our clinical development of fampridine sr for sci in the future 
in july  we acquired all of elan s research  development  distribution  sales and marketing rights to zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets in the united states 
these products are fda approved for the management of spasticity 
we made an upfront payment to elan of million and are obligated to pay royalties on sales and to make milestone payments upon achievement of specified sales levels 
to date  we have achieved three milestones  the first triggering a payment of million  of which was paid in the first quarter of and of which was paid in the first quarter of the second milestone of million was paid in march the third milestone of million was paid in february as part of our zanaflex acquisition  we entered into a long term supply agreement with elan under which elan provides us with zanaflex capsules 
elan also assigned us its rights under an agreement with novartis for the supply of tizanidine and zanaflex tablets 
our marketing efforts are focused on zanaflex capsules  which we launched in april zanaflex tablets lost compound patent protection in and both zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets compete with generic tizanidine products 
although we currently distribute zanaflex tablets  we do not  and do not intend to  actively promote zanaflex tablets 
as a result  prescriptions for zanaflex tablets have declined and we expect that they will continue to decline 
our goal is to convert as many sales of zanaflex tablets and generic tizanidine tablets to sales of zanaflex capsules as possible 
we believe that sales of zanaflex capsules will constitute a significant portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future 
in late  we began establishing our own specialty sales force in the united states  which consisted of sales professionals as of december  and was expanded to sales professionals by the first quarter of this sales force has targeted neurologists and other prescribers who specialize in treating people with conditions that involve spasticity 
members of this sales force also call on managed care organizations  pharmacists and distribution customers 
in august  we entered into an agreement with cardinal health  under which it had provided approximately sales representatives to market zanaflex capsules  on a non exclusive basis  to primary care physicians in the united states 
sales in the primary care market did not reach the targets specified in our agreement 
we terminated the agreement with cardinal health and made a payment of  in connection with that termination during the third quarter of in may  we retained access worldwide communications  inc access to provide a small  dedicated sales force of pharmaceutical telesales professionals to contact primary care  specialty physicians and pharmacists 
in february  we expanded the scope of the arrangement with access and transferred some of the primary care physician contacts previously covered by cardinal health to access 
our contract with access is now serviced by tms professional markets group  llc  which purchased various telesales assets from access in in addition  we initiated a pilot program with innovex inc that provided six part time representatives making exclusive calls promoting zanaflex capsules to primary care physicians  focusing on some of the contacts previously covered by cardinal health 
in october  we gave notice to innovex inc of termination of our contract sales force agreement 
in december  we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with prf pursuant to which we assigned prf the right to receive a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement which definition is different from our net revenues as determined in accordance with gaap from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
the agreement covers all such zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement is terminated earlier 
in consideration for the assignment  prf paid us million at signing 
we used approximately million of that payment to repay a portion of the amount we owe to ge capital   of that payment for expenses associated with such repayment and  of that payment to reimburse prf for expenses it incurred in the transaction 
under our agreement with prf  we are required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement to support commercialization  sales  marketing  clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our zanaflex operations 
if our zanaflex net revenues in had equaled or exceeded million and our zanaflex net revenues in the first six months of had equaled or exceeded million  at our election  prf would also have been required to loan us an additional million 
we did not meet this milestone 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interests assignment agreement with prf 
under the amendment  prf is entitled to a royalty consisting of certain specified percentages of zanaflex net revenues  based upon the level of net revenues 
the amendment provides that the royalty rate will drop to upon prf s receipt of times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  as amended 
previously  once prf had received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least twice the aggregate amount prf paid us under the agreement  the royalty rate would drop to of zanaflex net revenues 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and agreed that we would be entitled to an additional million is due if our net revenues during the fiscal year equaled or exceeded million 
this milestone has been met and the receivable is reflected in our december  financial statements 
this milestone payment was received in february under the terms of the amendment  we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  for more information regarding our agreement with prf  see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
we completed an initial public offering on february  in which  shares of our common stock were sold  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  all of our convertible preferred stock and mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock 
this conversion resulted in the following a recognition of the unamortized portion of a beneficial conversion charge of million  b recognition of the unamortized portion of issuance costs relating to series e  series i  series j and series k preferred stock of  and c reversal of accrued preferred dividends on series j and series k preferred stock of million 
we completed a private placement on october  in which  shares of our common stock were sold  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting issuance costs 
product revenue and returns ongoing zanaflex capsule and tablet sales product revenue consists of sales of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets 
under sfas  revenue recognition when the right of return exists  we are not permitted to recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products 
since we have only limited sales history with zanaflex capsules and due to generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we cannot reasonably determine a return rate 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
at a future point in time  we expect to be able to reasonably estimate product returns and will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to end users because once prescriptions are filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
we began receiving end user prescription data in march which enabled us to begin recognizing revenue from zanaflex tablet sales 
we began marketing zanaflex capsules in april and began receiving prescription data and recognizing revenue in the same month 
under our revenue interests assignment agreement with prf  as amended in november  prf is entitled to a portion of our net revenues from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
the agreement covers all zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
under the agreement  prf is entitled to a certain portion of such zanaflex net revenues 
for more information regarding our agreement with prf  see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
we accept returns of products for six months prior to and months after their expiration date 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
sale of zanaflex tablet inventory acquired from elan when we acquired zanaflex from elan  we also acquired elan s inventory of zanaflex tablets 
this inventory included partial lots with expiration dating of less than months and full lots with expiration dating greater than months 
the majority of this product was sold by us during july through march we deferred recognition of any revenue from sales of the partial lot inventory until the return period for the product expired in june months following product expiration 
we could not use prescription data to recognize revenue associated with the partial lot inventory acquired from elan because we could not determine whether the prescription was filled with product that elan sold prior to our acquisition of zanaflex or with product we sold 
we received returns of the product sold by elan through june at which point the right of return expired and we recognized the remaining million deferred revenue balance as gross sales 
returns of zanaflex tablets sold by elan as part of the acquisition of zanaflex  we agreed to accept returns of zanaflex tablets that were returned subsequent to january   including returns of product that was originally sold by elan 
product returns prior to january   were the responsibility of elan 
we recorded a charge of million in the year ended december   for the estimated returns of zanaflex tablets sold by elan 
our obligation to continue to accept these returns ended in june as a result of the returns we accepted since  the net balance remaining on this liability was approximately million 
we reversed this liability in june which resulted in a reduction in discounts and allowances of million and a corresponding reduction of the product return liability on our balance sheet 
discounts and allowances reserves for cash discounts  rebates and chargebacks have been established 
at the time product is shipped to wholesalers a charge is recorded to discounts and allowances and the appropriate reserves are credited 
allowances are established on a product by product basis 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate of each product s historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for chargebacks  rebates and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers  analyses of historical usage of discount  chargeback and rebate reserves  communications with customers  the level of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  expectations about the market for each product and any anticipated introduction of competitive products 
grant revenue grant revenue is recognized when the related research expenses are incurred and our performance obligations under the terms of the respective contract are satisfied 
to the extent expended  grant revenue related to the purchase of equipment is deferred and amortized over the shorter of its useful life or the life of the related contract 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the zanaflex acquisition  packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our zanaflex acquisition 
any payments we make to prf in connection with the revenue interests assignment transaction entered into in december will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales

deferred revenue from zanaflex tablets was million as of december   an increase of million since december   as compared to million as of december  the increase in deferred revenue of zanaflex tablets resulted from increased shipment levels 
approximately million of the deferred revenue at december  relates to product that we acquired from elan that had an expiration date of less than months at the time we sold it during we believe there is a high likelihood that this product will be returned  which would result in our inability to recognize the deferred revenue related to that shipped product

eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities 
on december   eis transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
in december  saints capital exercised the conversion option of their million note and received  shares of common stock 
the remaining million convertible promissory note is convertible into  shares of common stock 
in august and september  we financed certain of our fixed assets through two financing agreements with general electric capital corporation  or ge capital  in the aggregate amount of approximately million  which was repaid in full in september in january  we entered into a million senior secured term loan  which is collateralized by all of our personal property and fixtures  other than the property that secures our revenue interests assignment arrangement with prf  of which million was outstanding as of december  on december   we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with prf  a dedicated healthcare investment fund  pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
to secure our obligations to prf  we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex 
our agreement with prf covers all zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interests assignment agreement with prf 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and an additional million is due as our net revenues during the fiscal year exceeded million 
this receivable is reflected in our financial statements 
under the terms of the amendment  we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  under the agreement and the amendment  prf is entitled to the following portion of zanaflex net revenues with respect to zanaflex net revenues up to and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million but less than and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  and with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  once prf has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  prf will only be entitled to of zanaflex net revenues 
in connection with the transaction  we have a liability recorded  referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately million in accordance with eitf  sales of future revenues 
we will impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and will record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of zanaflex sales 
we currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 
payments made to prf as a result of zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability 
in consideration for our assignment of the right to receive a portion of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  prf paid us million at signing of the original agreement 
we used approximately million of the signing payment to repay a portion of the amount we owe to ge capital  approximately  of the signing payment for fees and expenses associated with such repayment and  of the signing payment to reimburse prf for expenses it estimated it incurred in the transaction 
under our agreement with prf  we were required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement or amendment to support commercialization  sales  marketing  clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our zanaflex operations 
we may not use any proceeds from our agreement or amendment with prf to support any of our other products unless such use is ancillary to the support of commercialization of zanaflex 
upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events  transfer any of our interests in zanaflex other than pursuant to a license agreement  development  commercialization  co promotion  collaboration  partnering or similar agreement  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  or breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties we make under the agreement  prf may i require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or ii foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf 
except in the case of certain bankruptcy events  if prf exercises its right  which we refer to as prf s put option  to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it  prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put call price as required 
if we experience a change of control we have the right  which we refer to as our call option  to repurchase the rights we sold to prf at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised 
the put call price on a given date is the greater of i all payments made by prf to us as of such date  less all payments received by prf from us as of such date  and ii an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of on all payments made by prf to us as of such date  taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date 
we have determined that prf s put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such 
therefore  we recorded a net liability of approximately  as of december  related to the put call option to reflect its estimated fair value as of the date of the agreement  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives instruments and hedging activities 
this liability is revalued on a quarterly basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings 
during any period during which prf has the right to receive of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  then of the first million in payments from zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to prf on a daily basis 
following the end of each fiscal quarter  if the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive  prf will remit such excess to us 
if the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter  we will remit such excess to prf 
prf also has the right to appoint a representative to receive all notices and materials provided to our board of directors and to attend as an observer all meetings of our board of directors  subject to certain exceptions 
this right will terminate on the earlier to occur of february  the fourth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering of shares of our common stock or termination of the revenue interests assignment agreement 
investment activities at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in money market funds with commercial banks and financial institutions and high quality government and investment grade corporate bonds 
also  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million as of december  our short term investments consist of corporate debt securities with remaining maturities greater than three months and less than one year 
the balance of these investments was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  net cash used in operations net cash used in operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash used by operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a net loss of million  a decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses  and other liabilities of million  an increase in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in tablet deferred product revenue of million and a decrease in returns liability of million 
cash used in operations for the year ended december   was partially offset by non cash stock compensation expense of million  an increase in capsule deferred product revenue of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million

future capital needs our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of revenue generated from sales of zanaflex capsules  the continued progress of our research and development activities  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the amount and timing of milestone or other payments made under collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and the acquisition of licenses to new products or compounds 
we expect to incur losses from operations for at least the next several years as we continue to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure and increase our marketing efforts to support the commercialization of zanaflex capsules  continue our clinical development of fampridine sr and advance our preclinical programs 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and short term investment will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt repayments and capital equipment requirements through the first quarter of we may seek additional financing in the near future to ensure the completion of fampridine sr s clinical development 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements  we will need to raise additional capital  reduce cash expenditures or incur indebtedness to fund our operations 
we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our sales and marketing efforts  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
contractual obligations and commitments in january  we entered into a million senior secured term loan with ge capital 
in december  we used a portion of the initial payment we received under our revenue interest assignment arrangement with prf to repay approximately million of this loan 
we are required to pay monthly installments until february  with interest only payments for the first six months followed by principal and interest payments for the remaining months 
interest is fixed at the rate of per annum 
the loan is secured by all of our personal property and fixtures  other than the property that secures our arrangement with prf 
in january  eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes 
one promissory note in the principal amount of million bears interest at a rate of which began on the first anniversary of the note 
the other promissory note in the amount of million was non interest bearing 
on december   eis transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
in december  saints capital exercised the conversion option of the million convertible promissory note at an exercise price of per share and received  shares of common stock 
the remaining million convertible promissory note is convertible into  shares of common stock 
principal and interest are repayable  if not converted  ratably over a seven year period  beginning one year after we receive regulatory approval for certain products to be developed  subject to limitations related to gross margin on product sales 
if we and sants capital determine that regulatory approval will not likely occur  the million promissory note will automatically convert into the underlying common stock unless saints capital elects to have the amount due on the note cancelled 
if our license and supply agreements with elan are terminated for any other reason  the principal and interest is repayable ratably over years 
the million promissory note restricts our ability to incur indebtedness that is senior to the note  subject to certain exceptions  including for our revenue interests assignment arrangement with prf 
under our zanaflex purchase agreement with elan  we are obligated to make milestone payments to elan of up to million based on cumulative gross sales of zanaflex tablets and zanaflex capsules 
as of december   we have made or accrued million of these milestone payments in the consolidated financial statements 
under our zanaflex supply agreement with elan  we are required to provide to elan an month rolling forecast at the beginning of each month and a two year forecast not later than july of each year 
we are required to order of the forecast required quantities for each five month period immediately following each monthly forecast report 
at december   the forecast requirement for the five month period following december  amounted to approximately million 
under our fampridine sr license agreement with elan  we are obligated to make milestone payments to elan of up to million over the life of the contract and royalty payments as a percentage of product sales 
in addition  under our various other research  license and collaboration agreements with other parties we are obligated to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of approximately million over the life of the contracts 
in december  we entered into a revenue interests assignment agreement with prf pursuant to which we assigned prf the right to receive a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement which definition is different from our net revenues as determined in accordance with gaap from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
the agreement covers all such zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement is terminated earlier 
in consideration for the assignment  prf paid us million at signing 
we used approximately million of that payment to repay a portion of the amount we owe to ge capital   of that payment for expenses associated with such repayment and  of that payment to reimburse prf for expenses it incurred in the transaction 
under our agreement with prf  we are required to use the remainder of the amount we received at signing and any other amounts we receive under the agreement to support commercialization  sales  marketing  clinical and regulatory activities and other financial obligations related specifically and solely to our zanaflex operations 
if our zanaflex net revenues in had equaled or exceeded million and our zanaflex net revenues in the first six months of had equaled or exceeded million  at our election  prf would also have been required to loan us an additional million 
we did not meet this milestone 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interests assignment agreement with prf 
under the amendment  prf is entitled to a royalty consisting of certain specified percentages of zanaflex net revenues  based upon the level of net revenues 
previously  once prf had received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least twice the aggregate amount prf paid us under the agreement  the royalty rate would drop to of zanaflex net revenues 
the amendment provides that the royalty rate will drop to upon prf s receipt of times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  as amended 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and agreed that we would be entitled to an additional million is due if our net revenues during the fiscal year equaled or exceeded million 
this milestone has been met and the receivable is reflected in our december  financial statements 
this milestone payment was received in february under the terms of the amendment  we are required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations as of december  this table does not reflect contingent milestone or royalty payments that may result in future periods from our collaborations  alliances and or license agreements 
this table should be read in conjunction with the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements twelve month period ending december  notes payable operating leases inventory purchase commitment in thousands total notes payable represents the principal and interest payable on the ge capital notes payable and does not include the million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes payable to saints capital or milestone payments under our license agreements as these amounts are payable on contingent events 
under the terms of the employment agreement with our chief executive officer  ron cohen  we are obligated to pay severance under certain circumstances 
if the employment agreement is terminated by us or by our chief executive officer for reasons other than for cause  we must pay an amount equal to i the base salary the chief executive officer would have received during the month period immediately following the date of termination  plus ii the last annual bonus received by the chief executive officer multiplied by a fraction  the numerator of which is the number of days in the calendar year elapsed as of the termination date and the denominator of which is under the terms of the employment agreements with our chief scientific officer  andrew blight  our chief operating officer  mary fisher  our chief financial officer  david lawrence and our general counsel  jane wasman  we are obligated to pay severance under certain circumstances 
in the event we terminate our employment agreement with dr 
blight  ms 
fisher  mr 
lawrence or ms 
wasman without cause  or if one of them voluntarily terminates his or her agreements with good reason  we are obligated to make severance payments equal to nine months base annual salary  in the case of dr 
blight and ms 
fisher  and seven months base annual salary  in the case of mr 
lawrence and ms 
wasman  as well as cobra premium payments for the severance period

all options that have vested as of the termination date shall remain exercisable for days following such date 
all unvested options  stock appreciation rights awards and stock awards will be cancelled on the date of termination 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  primarily employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this prospectus 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as our areas of critical accounting policies sales revenue recognition  research and development  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we apply the revenue recognition guidance in sfas no 
 revenue recognition when the right of return exists  which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue 
under sfas we are not permitted to recognize revenue until we can reasonably estimate the likely return rate for our products 
since we have only limited sales history with zanaflex capsules and due to generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we do not believe we can reasonably determine a return rate 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
at a future point in time  which could be in a number of years  when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns we will begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory shipped as inventory held by others 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
we estimate prescription sales until the data becomes available  at which time adjustments are made to revenue and cost of sales to account for any differences between our estimates and the actual data 
to date such differences have been immaterial 
the estimated prescription sales are based on the average of the prior two months prescriptions for both zanaflex tablets and zanaflex capsules 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
we began receiving end user prescription data in march which enabled us to begin recognizing revenue from zanaflex tablet sales 
we began marketing zanaflex capsules in april and began receiving prescription data and recognizing revenue in the same month 
in addition to the prescription data we purchase  we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers 
we receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis 
this data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers 
we also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis 
we use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs 
prescription comparison to better understand market conditions  but not as a basis for recognizing revenue 
we accept returns of products for six months prior to and months after their expiration date 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities including  salaries and benefits  occupancy costs  and research and development conducted for us by third parties  such as sponsored university based research  and clinical trial vendors 
in addition  research and development expenses include expenses related to grant revenue and the cost of clinical trial drug supply shipped to our clinical study vendors 
we account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur  beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december  and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at december  as of december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal and state income tax purposes  which are available to offset future federal and state taxable income  if any  and expire between and and research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and expect to incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  the code  provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the code that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the code  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
stock based compensation historically  we accounted for share based compensation costs under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  using a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation plans 
on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires that the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method  under which the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of the awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations over the remaining service period after the adoption date based on the award s original estimate of fair value 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed from recognizing the effect of forfeitures as they occur to estimating the number of outstanding instruments for which the requisite service is not expected to be rendered 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recognized forfeitures associated with its share based awards as they occurred rather than estimating forfeitures 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  during the three month period ended march   calculated as the difference between compensation cost recognized to date using actual forfeitures and the cost that would have been recognized to date using estimated forfeitures 
we estimate that our future annual forfeiture rate will be 
we account for stock options granted to non employees on a fair value basis in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinion no 
and item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  grant receivable  notes payable  convertible notes payable  accounts payable  warrant liability  and put call liability 
the estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments  excluding convertible notes payable to saints capital  approximate their carrying amounts at december  the terms of these notes are disclosed at note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have cash equivalents and short term investments at december   which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and corporate debt securities  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments
