our strategy the key elements of our business strategy are as follows leveraging our technological leadership in influenza vaccines 
our recombinant vlp technology is well suited to create a differentiated vaccine against pandemic and seasonal influenza 
this technology addresses several of the technical and logistical issues associated with a potential pandemic 
it allows rapid creation of new vaccines that have high fidelity to emerging strains of influenza and the manufacturing process can be rapidly commissioned and scaled up 
in addition  the technology provides the potential to differentiate a seasonal flu vaccine 
maximizing the commercial impact of estrasorb and continuing to expand our drug delivery and formulation technologies 
after licensing the north american marketing rights for estrasorb and androsorb to esprit  we are looking to license the rights to market this product in other territories 
in addition  we continue our efforts to improve the packaging of estrasorb to improve our margins on the product 
our proven mnp technology has resulted in several product candidates that can be licensed to pharmaceutical companies 
we have been able to demonstrate the benefits of our formulation for several compounds and are actively seeking to license these product candidates 
leveraging our formulation science to develop adjuvants for better vaccines 
adjuvants improve immunogenicity of vaccines and they are becoming central for competitive advantage of new vaccines 
our inherent strengths in formulations are well suited to develop new adjuvants  such as novasomes  that can lead to best in class vaccines 
these adjuvants can also be products in themselves and can be licensed to other companies to be used with their antigens 
developing new technologies  evaluating strategic alliances and acquisitions and fortifying our intellectual property 
we continue to improve upon our current portfolio of technologies in formulations and vaccines 
we believe these improvements will result in new intellectual property  making us more competitive 
leveraging collaborations and partnerships to advance products and technologies 
we are engaged in seeking collaborations and partnerships to develop and commercialize our products 
these include partnerships with governmental and academic organizations as well as other industry partners 
research and development activities biologics we develop and produce biopharmaceutical proteins for use as vaccines against pandemic and seasonal influenza and other infectious diseases  and as tolerogens to prevent inflammatory responses in the initiation and progression of stroke and other illnesses 
our lead vaccine technology platform is based on virus like particles vlps  which are self assembling protein structures that resemble viruses 
these are non infectious particles that for many viral diseases have been shown in animal and human studies to make effective vaccines 
vlps closely mimic natural virus particles with repeating protein structures that can elicit broad and strong antibody and cellular immune responses  but lack the genetic material required for replication 
we have several ongoing development programs involving vlp vaccines that address urgent medical needs  including pandemic and seasonal influenza  hiv aids and other infectious diseases 
we collaborate with governmental  commercial and leading academic institutions in development  safety testing and clinical trials 
influenza vlp vaccine 
according to the center for disease control  every year between and of the us population is infected by the influenza virus 
while the severity of illness varies  influenza causes an estimated  deaths in the us and  worldwide annually 
these seasonal outbreaks have in recent years been caused by subtypes of influenza virus designated as hn and hn more recently  unexpected subtypes of avian origin have resulted in severe morbidity and mortality in a limited number of people 
highly pathogenic hn influenza viruses are now widespread in poultry in asia and have spread to some european countries  where they have been linked to human infection 
genetic reassortment between avian and human influenza subtypes  or genetic mutations  may lead to the emergence of a virus capable of causing worldwide illness  a pandemic 
all currently available influenza vaccines are produced by growing virus in chicken eggs  from which the virus is extracted and further processed 
this year old production method requires six to nine month lead times and significant investment in fixed production facilities  which  once commissioned  cannot have their capacity easily increased 
the vaccine shortage during the flu season highlighted the limitations of current production methods and the need for increased vaccine manufacturing capacity 
it also heightened concerns regarding manufacturers capacity to respond to a pandemic  when the number of vaccine doses required will be higher than the number required for seasonal flu vaccines and lead times will be even shorter 
novavax is applying its expertise in producing vlps to develop vaccines for both seasonal and pandemic strains of influenza 
we produce vlps using a baculovirus expression system in insect cells with disposable  low cost equipment that can be readily dispersed both nationally and internationally 
by not requiring a fixed plant  production capacity can be increased quickly to whatever extent is required 
lead times for production are expected to be measured in weeks  not months 
proof of concept of the vlp approach in influenza has been obtained in various pre clinical studies 
in a recent study  co expression of three genes hemagglutinin  neuraminidase and matrix derived from the hn influenza in insect cells resulted in the self assembly of influenza hn vlps 
the hn vlps elicited protective immune responses in mice and ferrets 
in view of these encouraging preclinical data  we have accelerated and prioritized the development of our vlp influenza vaccines 
we have completed comprehensive pre clinical studies in with the objective of initiating human clinical studies with influenza vlp vaccines in hiv aids vlp vaccine 
the human toll of aids is staggering and now kills more people worldwide than any other infectious disease 
nearly million people are infected with hiv  including four to six million people who were newly infected in  according to the world health organization who 
under a five year national institutes of health nih grant  which was awarded in  we are working in collaboration with leading scientists from the university of alabama birmingham  emory university and harvard medical school in the development of a second generation aids vaccine 
in january  the company announced that it has significantly enhanced both the quality and purity of its vlp vaccine for hiv aids 
this second generation aids vaccine is based on the hiv viral envelope with a natural three dimensional structure to trigger a protective immune response 
preclinical studies are under way using the improved hiv vaccine  and planning has begun to advance this new vaccine to human clinical trials in collaboration with the us government 
early versions of novavax s vlp vaccine were successful in triggering immune responses in preclinical studies 
novavax scientists and its collaborators discovered a way to optimize the expression of the hiv envelope  which is a principle target for immunity in humans 
sars vlp vaccine 
in  the nih awarded us a million  three year grant to develop a vaccine to prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
sars is a severe form of pneumonia  accompanied by a fever and caused by a coronavirus 
who has reported over  sars cases with nearly deaths since the first case of sars was reported in february our sars vlp vaccine is also based on the production of coronavirus like vlps in insect cells 
hepatitis e vaccine 
hepatitis e is the most prevalent form of acute hepatitis in the developing world 
hepatitis e is transmitted through contaminated water and is indistinguishable from the disease caused by the hepatitis a virus 
the disease is rarely fatal  although the risk of death and the intensity of the illness increase with age  with pregnant women being at a particularly high risk 
in collaboration with the national institute of allergy and infectious disease  walter reed army institute for research  and glaxosmithkline pharmaceuticals  we have developed vaccines to prevent hepatitis caused by the hepatitis e virus 
the recombinant hepatitis e vaccine produced by us is in clinical trials conducted by glaxosmithkline 
as reported in the new england journal of medicine march   this recombinant hepatitis e vaccine was evaluated for safety and efficacy in a phase ii  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled trial in  healthy adults susceptible to hepatitis e virus infection and found to be effective in the prevention of hepatitis e 
glaxosmithkline has commercial rights and we will share royalties with the nih  if marketed 
e selectin tolerogen 
in collaboration with the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke we have been developing e selectin based molecularly derived products for the prevention of strokes 
in september  a published report in the professional journal stroke provided experimental evidence on prevention of stroke in stroke prone rats 
these results provided supportive evidence that e selectin tolerization may help in the prevention of strokes and other illness where inflammatory and immune responses are involved in the initiation and progression of disease 
we were awarded a government contract for the pre clinical development and manufacture of e selectin for phase i clinical trials to be run by the national institute of neurological disease and stroke and the nih 
novasome adjuvant program 
adjuvants are agents that enhance the immune response generated by antigens 
as a consequence  smaller amounts of antigen can elicit the desired immune response  referred to as an antigen sparing effect 
in addition  adjuvants may elicit responses from multiple components of the immune system leading to an improved level of immunity and protection 
novasomes  our proprietary adjuvants  are currently being evaluated in both the influenza and the hiv aids vlp vaccine programs 
preclinical data have demonstrated an encouraging degree of improvement in immune responses with a variety of antigens 
if warranted by future studies  novasomes will be included in human studies of our vlp vaccines 
formulation science the formulations group is committed to the creation and development of innovative and effective technologies for enhancing the performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients apis that are approved by the food and drug administration fda 
use of apis simplifies clinical testing and fda approval because of the safety and efficacy records of the apis 
the key drivers for these research programs are those therapeutic segments and clinical conditions that cannot be satisfied by the conventional dosage forms 
we have two drug delivery platform technologies micellar nanoparticles this is a nanotechnology based  lotion like formulation that has achieved a significant break through in transdermal therapeutics 
upon topical application  an mnp formulation deposits the api in both a readily available solution form as well as in a long acting particulate depot form onto the skin 
the inactive ingredients used in the formulation not only help in forming an occlusive barrier that acts as a pseudo patch  but also drives the drug into the systemic circulation 
unlike conventional passive transdermal delivery systems such as patches  gels  and creams with chemical permeation enhancers  the mnps have been shown to accommodate and deliver a wide spectrum of drugs having diverse lipophilicities ie  affinities for a hydrophobic or oil phase  molecular weights  melting points  and dosages 
novasomes these are non phospholipid based  proprietary vesicular structures that can be either used for delivery of drugs or as vaccine adjuvants 
typically  novasomes can be utilized for encapsulation of both hydrophilic and lipophilic drugs 
the formulation design enhances deposition and retention of the active ingredients within the superficial skin layers epidermis but limits their passage into the systemic circulation 
novasomes  when formulated as vaccine adjuvants for co administration with a vaccine preparation  have demonstrated a significantly improved immunogenicity profile 
the focus of our drug delivery product development is transdermal delivery both from a traditional and a non traditional perspective 
traditionally  this route of administration is known to offer therapeutic benefits like avoiding hepatic first pass metabolism  overcoming stability and toxicity issues related to oral administration  and has been viewed as a non invasive pathway to achieve drug transport into the systemic circulation through topical application 
it is generally accepted that the best drug candidates for transdermal delivery are non ionic  lipophilic and potent and have a low molecular weight and a low melting point 
our first set of product candidates falls in this category  which includes testosterone  nicotine  fentanyl  clonidine  loratadine and oxybutynin 
estrasorb  our first internally developed product  is a topical estradiol replacement lotion that helps validate the mnp based transdermal technology 
estrasorb is the first topical emulsion for estrogen therapy approved by the fda for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms hot flashes associated with menopause 
this product is unique in that it is the first commercial nanoparticle based transdermal pharmaceutical product 
estrasorb has undergone the complete product development to commercialization cycle 
in october  the company licensed the marketing rights for estrasorb to esprit 
this licensing agreement has provided a cash consideration of million within the first year as well as sales based milestone payments and a double digit royalty on all sales 
we retained rights to manufacture the product for esprit at set prices and retained marketing rights for all territories outside of north america 
however  the cost at which we manufacture estrasorb currently exceeds the fixed price at which we sell the product to esprit 
our mnp testosterone product candidate for the treatment of female hypoactive sexual disorder is the second product in our pipeline 
in april  we entered into a second license and supply agreement with esprit to co develop  supply and commercialize this mnp testosterone product candidate 
under the terms of the license agreement  esprit was granted exclusive rights to this mnp testosterone product candidate in north america 
we will receive a royalty on all net sales of the product as well as milestone payments on specific pre determined clinical and regulatory milestones 
esprit will be responsible for all development costs and will lead all clinical programs 
under the term of the supply agreement  we will be responsible for manufacturing the product 
the mnp platform addresses several issues related to product development ability to formulate apis with a wider range of chemical characteristics compared to traditional transdermal drug delivery technologies 
rapid and reliable product development  optimization  and screening 
more simple  quick  and cost effective regulatory approval than the approval process for a new chemical entity 
research and development funding total externally contracted research and development costs were million in  million in and million in total internally sponsored research and development costs were million in  million in and million in our manufacturing start up costs related to preparing our manufacturing facility for commercial production of estrasorb were included in research and development until april  at which time the manufacturing costs have been included in cost of sales and inventory 
total manufacturing start up costs related to estrasorb included in research and development were million in further development costs of million for estrasorb were included in internally sponsored research and development costs 
competition technologies the biopharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological progress 
we compete in two primary technology areas vaccines and transdermal pharmaceutical delivery 
we compete in a competitive and capital intensive vaccine arena 
our technology is based upon utilizing the baculovirus expression system in insect cells to make vlps 
we believe this system offers many advantages when compared to other technologies and is uniquely suited for developing pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines as well as other infectious diseases 
the table below provides a list of key competitors and corresponding influenza vaccine technologies 
company competing technology description sanofi pasteur  inc inactivated sub unit egg based medimmune vaccines  inc nasal  live attenuated cell based glaxosmithkline biologicals inactivated egg based novartis  inc inactivated sub unit egg based merck co  inc novel vaccines the transdermal drug delivery arena is highly competitive with a broad array of passive and active transdermal drug delivery technologies 
our technologies include mnps and novasomes 
the mnp technology which is the basis for our fda approved product estrasorb competes with a number of companies and technologies 
the following table highlights several competitors and their corresponding technologies 
company competing technology description noven pharmaceuticals passive transdermal patches antares pharma  inc passive topical gels acrux limited passive metered dose transdermal spray solvay group passive topical gels alza corporation active transdermal micro projection enhanced permeation  electro transport transpharma medical ltd 
active transdermal radio frequency enhanced permeation altea therapeutics corporation active transdermal thermally enhanced permeation hormone therapy products through estrasorb and our mnp testosterone product candidate  we continue to compete with specialty biopharmaceutical firms and large pharmaceutical companies in the u 
s  europe and elsewhere that are engaged in the discovery  development and marketing of hormone therapies  and other products that do or could compete with our currently marketed product and product candidates 
these companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies and private research organizations  also compete with us in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants 
in  we licensed estrasorb to esprit 
the estrogen therapy market is highly competitive  well established and includes many products marketed by major pharmaceutical companies 
the oral segment  which accounts for over of the estrogen therapy market  is dominated by wyeth s premarin  an oral estrogen tablet 
wyeth commits significant resources to promoting its portfolio of estrogen products and has a dominant presence with healthcare professionals that utilize oral estrogen therapy products 
further  we compete with wyeth and numerous other companies marketing oral products  including manufacturers of generic estradiol 
gynodiol  our marketed oral estrogen therapy product also competes in the crowded  competitive oral estrogen therapy market 
transdermal estrogen therapy products patches currently account for approximately of the estrogen therapy market 
patch products are well accepted and many  such as vivelle dot  have been marketed for several years 
solvay pharmaceuticals  a large international pharmaceutical company  recently introduced an ethanol based gel product  estrogel that is directly competing with estrasorb 
in addition to the currently approved and marketed products  several estrogen therapy products are in development 
new products in general  competition among pharmaceutical products is based in part on product efficacy  safety  reliability  availability  price and patent position 
an important factor is the relative timing of the market introduction of our products and our competitors products 
accordingly  the speed with which we can develop products  complete the clinical trials and approval processes and supply commercial quantities of the products to the market is an important competitive factor 
our competitive position also depends upon our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  obtain patent protection or otherwise develop proprietary products or processes  and secure sufficient capital resources for the often substantial period between technological conception and commercial sale 
patents and proprietary rights we generally seek patent protection for our technology and product candidates in the us and abroad 
we have submitted patent applications that are pending in the us and other countries 
the patent position of biotechnology firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
our success will depend  in part  on whether we can obtain patents to protect our own technologies and products  obtain licenses to use the technologies of third parties  which may be protected by patents  protect our trade secrets and know how  and operate without infringing the intellectual property and proprietary rights of others 
patent rights  licenses 
our licensors and we have patents and continue to seek patent protection for technologies that relate to our product candidates  as well as technologies that may prove useful for future product candidates 
we currently have over us patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications relating to vaccines  biologics  and drug delivery systems and applications for various biological and chemical uses 
we have us patent applications pending in both the us and worldwide covering the composition  manufacture and use of our organized lipid structures and related technologies 
a current us patent issued in covers our mnp technology and methods of their production 
in addition  the company continues to build upon its technology portfolio and file appropriate intellectual property disclosures and patent applications 
consistent with statutory guidelines issued under the federal technology transfer act of designed to encourage the dissemination of science and technology innovation and provide sharing of technology that has commercial potential  our collaborative research efforts with the us government and with other private entities receiving federal funding provide that developments and results must be freely published  that information or materials supplied by us will not be treated as confidential and that we will be required to negotiate a license to any such developments and results in order to commercialize products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully obtain any such license at a reasonable cost  or that such developments and results will not be made available to our competitors on an exclusive or nonexclusive basis 
trade secrets 
to a more limited extent  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests 
it is our policy to require employees  consultants  contractors  manufacturers  collaborators  and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment  consulting or collaborative relationships with us 
we also require signed confidentiality agreements from any entity that is to receive confidential information 
with respect to employees  consultants and contractors  the agreements generally provide that all inventions made by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our property 
government regulations the development  production and marketing of pharmaceutical and biological products developed by novavax or our collaborators is subject to regulation for safety  efficacy and quality by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries 
in the u 
s  the development  manufacturing and marketing of human pharmaceuticals and vaccines are subject to extensive regulation under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and biological products are subject to regulation both under provisions of that act and under the public health service act 
the fda assesses the safety and efficacy of products and regulates  among other things  the testing  manufacture  labeling  storage  record keeping  and advertising and promotion 
the process of obtaining fda approval for a new product is costly and time consuming 
before applying for fda approval to market any new drug product candidates  we must first submit an investigational new drug application an ind that explains to the fda the results of pre clinical testing conducted in laboratory animals and what we propose to do for human testing 
at this stage  the fda decides whether it is reasonably safe to move forward with testing the drug on humans 
we must then conduct phase i studies and larger scale phase ii and iii human clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products to the satisfaction of the fda 
once these trials are complete  a new drug application an nda can be filed with the fda requesting approval of the drug marketing 
vaccine clinical development follows the same general pathway as for drugs and other biologics 
a sponsor who wishes to begin clinical trials with a vaccine must submit an ind describing the vaccine  its method of manufacture and quality control tests for release 
pre marketing pre licensure vaccine clinical trials are typically done in three phases 
initial human studies  referred to as phase i  are safety and immunogenicity studies performed in a small number of closely monitored subjects 
phase ii studies are dose ranging studies and may enroll hundreds or thousands of subjects 
finally  phase iii trials typically enroll thousands of individuals and provide the critical documentation of effectiveness and important additional safety data required for licensing 
if successful  the completion of all three phases of clinical development can be followed by the submission of a biologics license application a bla 
also during this stage  the proposed manufacturing facility undergoes a pre approval inspection during which production of the vaccine as it is in progress is examined in detail 
vaccine approval also requires the provision of adequate product labeling to allow health care providers to understand the vaccine s proper use  including its potential benefits and risks  to communicate with patients and parents  and to safely deliver the vaccine to the public 
until a vaccine is given to the general population  all potential adverse events cannot be anticipated 
thus  many vaccines undergo phase iv studies after a bla has been approved and the vaccine is licensed and on the market 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each product  each domestic manufacturing establishment must be registered with the fda  is subject to fda inspection and must comply with current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations 
to supply products for use either in the us or outside the us  including clinical trials  us and non us manufacturing establishments  including third party facilities  must comply with cgmp regulations and are subject to periodic inspection by the corresponding regulatory agencies in their home country under reciprocal agreements with the fda and or by the fda 
preclinical studies may take several years to complete and there is no guarantee that the fda will permit an ind based on those studies to become effective and the product to advance to clinical testing 
clinical trials may take several years to complete 
after the completion of the required phases of clinical trials  if the data indicate that the drug or biologic product is safe and effective  a bla or nda depending on whether the product is a biologic or pharmaceutical product is filed with the fda to approve the marketing and commercial shipment of the drug 
this process takes substantial time and effort and the fda may not accept the bla or nda for filing  and  even if filed  the fda might not grant approval 
fda approval of a bla or nda may take up to two years and may take longer if substantial questions about the filing arise 
the fda may require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the applicable products 
in addition to regulatory approvals that must be obtained in the us an investigational product is also subject to regulatory approval in other countries in which it is intended to be marketed 
no such product can be marketed in a country until the regulatory authorities of that country have approved an appropriate license application 
fda approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities 
in addition  in many countries  the government is involved in the pricing of the product 
in such cases  the pricing review period often begins after market approval is granted 
we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act and other present and potential federal  state or local regulations 
these and other laws govern our use  handling and disposal of various biological and chemical substances used in  and wastes generated by  our operations 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals and viruses 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our resources 
additionally  for formulations containing controlled substances  we are subject to drug enforcement act dea regulations 
there have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years to subject the pricing of pharmaceutical and biological products to government control and to make other changes to the medical care system of the us it is uncertain what legislative proposals will be adopted or what actions federal  state or private payors for medical goods and services may take in response to any medical reform proposals or legislation 
we cannot predict the effect medical or health care reforms may have on our business  and no assurance can be given that any such reforms will not have a material adverse effect 
manufacturing we have a  square foot manufacturing facility situated within a cardinal health  inc facility in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
it is staffed by our employees and operates under our quality system 
estrasorb  our first fda approved commercial product  is being manufactured at this facility 
there have been no adverse observations from fda inspections associated with the production of estrasorb 
for our vaccine business  we have a research and development facility in rockville  maryland and have established laboratories and staff to support the non gmp production and process development of more advanced manufacturing processes and product characterization method for our vaccine candidates 
we have completed renovations of cgmp suites at this facility which will incorporate disposable cell culture equipment obtained from wave biotech to support the manufacturing requirements for early stage clinical trial materials for our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccine candidates and other biologic products 
we intend to continue expanding our own product development and manufacturing capability while utilizing third party contractors where we lack sufficient internal capability 
any plans to expand our internal manufacturing capabilities at our rockville  maryland facilities  including the facilities necessary to manufacture  test and package an adequate supply of finished products in order to meet our long term clinical needs  will require significant resources and will be subject to ongoing government approval and oversight 
we have the quality infrastructure to support release testing and stability evaluation of cgmp materials 
we also have the regulatory support to ensure compliance with fda and other regulatory authorities 
sources of supply most of the raw materials and other supplies required in our business are generally available from various suppliers in quantities adequate to meet our needs 
in some cases  we currently have only one supplier for certain of our manufacturing components 
we have plans in place to develop multiple suppliers for all critical supplies before the time we would put any of our product candidates into commercial production 
marketing and sales we continue to explore opportunities for corporate alliances and partners to help develop and ultimately commercialize and market our product candidates 
our strategy is to enter into collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and other companies for some or all aspects of product development  manufacturing  marketing and sales of our products that will require broad marketing capabilities and overseas marketing 
these collaborators are generally expected to be responsible for funding or reimbursing all or a portion of the development costs  including the costs of later stage clinical testing necessary to obtain regulatory clearances and for commercial scale manufacturing  in exchange for rights to market specific products in particular geographic territories 
employees as of february   we had full time employees and part time employees for a total of  of whom hold md or md degrees and of whom hold other advanced degrees 
of our total workforce  are engaged primarily in research  development and manufacturing activities and are engaged primarily in business development  finance and accounting and administrative functions 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and we consider our employee relations to be good

risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating our business 
there are a number of risk factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are indicated by forward looking statements 
some of the risks described relate principally to our business and the industry in which we operate 
others relate principally to the securities market and ownership of our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
you should also consider the other information included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  risks related to our business we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
our expenses have exceeded our revenues since our formation in  and our accumulated deficit at december  was million 
our net revenues for the last three fiscal years were million in  million in and million in we have received a limited amount of product related revenue from research contracts  licenses and agreements to provide vaccine products  services and adjuvant technologies 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in entering into strategic alliances or collaborative arrangements with other companies that will result in other significant revenues to offset our expenses 
our net losses for the last three fiscal years were million in  million in and million in our historical losses have resulted from research and development expenses for our vaccine and drug delivery product candidates and sales and marketing expenses for estrasorb  protection of our intellectual property and other general operating expenses 
our losses increased due to the launch of estrasorb as we expanded our manufacturing capacity and sales and marketing capabilities 
more recently  our losses have increased  and will continue to increase  as a result of higher research and development efforts to support the development of our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccines 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses and anticipate that our expenses and losses will increase in the foreseeable future as we seek to initiate phase i ii clinical trials for our pandemic and seasonal flu vaccines  initiate additional preclinical studies for other product candidates using our vlp vaccine technology platform  expand our manufacturing capacity  which will require that we build out a portion of our research and development space as a food and drug administration  or fda  compliant and validated product manufacturing facility  relocate some of our business operations to a newly leased facility  maintain  expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio  hire additional clinical  quality control  scientific and management personnel  and add operations  financial  accounting  facilities engineering and information systems personnel  consistent with expanding our operations 
as a result  we expect our cumulative operating loss to increase until such time  if ever  product sales  licensing fees  royalties  milestones  contract research and other sources generate sufficient revenue to fund our continuing operations 
we cannot predict when  if ever  we might achieve profitability and cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability  if achieved 
we have repositioned ourselves from a specialty pharmaceutical company and face all the risks inherent in the implementation of a new business strategy 
in conjunction with the sale of our prenatal and related product lines coupled with the grant of an exclusive north american license to esprit pharma  inc to our lead product estrasorb during the second half of  we have changed the focus of the company from the development and commercialization of specialty pharmaceutical products to the research and development of new products using our proprietary drug delivery and biological platforms 
we cannot predict whether we will be successful in implementing our new business strategy 
we intend to focus our research and development activities on areas in which we have particular strengths and on technologies that appear promising 
these technologies often are on the cutting edge of modern science 
as a result  the outcome of any research or development program is highly uncertain 
only a small fraction of these programs ultimately result in commercial products or even product candidates and a number of events could delay our development efforts and negatively impact our ability to obtain regulatory approval for  and to market and sell  a product candidate 
product candidates that initially appear promising often fail to yield successful products 
in many cases  preclinical or clinical studies will show that a product candidate is not efficacious or that it raises safety concerns or has other side effects that outweigh their intended benefit 
success in preclinical or early clinical trials may not translate into success in large scale clinical trials 
further  success in clinical trials will likely lead to increased investment  adversely affecting short term profitability  to bring such products to market 
even after a product is approved and launched  general usage or post marketing studies may identify safety or other previously unknown problems with the product  which may result in regulatory approvals being suspended  limited to narrow indications or revoked  or which may otherwise prevent successful commercialization 
we have limited financial resources and we are not certain that we will be able to maintain our operations or to fund the development of future products 
we do not expect to generate revenues from product sales  licensing fees  royalties  milestones  contract research or other sources in an amount sufficient to fund our operations  and we will therefore use our cash resources and expect to require additional funds to maintain our operations  continue our research and development programs  commence future preclinical studies and clinical trials  seek regulatory approvals and manufacture and market our products 
we will seek such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements and other sources 
we cannot be certain that adequate additional funding will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we cannot raise the additional funds required for our anticipated operations  we may be required to delay significantly  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  downsize our general and administrative infrastructure  or seek alternative measures to avoid insolvency  including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products 
if we raise additional funds through future offerings of shares of our common stock or other securities  such offerings would cause dilution of existing stockholders percentage ownership in the company 
these future offerings also could have a material and adverse effect on the price of common stock 
many of our competitors have significantly greater resources and experience  which may negatively impact our commercial opportunities and those of our current and future licensees 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are subject to intense competition and rapid and significant technological change 
we have many potential competitors  including major drug and chemical companies  specialized biotechnology firms  academic institutions  government agencies and private and public research institutions 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources  experience and expertise in research and development  preclinical testing  designing and implementing clinical trials  regulatory processes and approvals  production and manufacturing  and sales and marketing of approved products 
principal competitive factors in our industry include the quality and breadth of an organization s technology  management of the organization and the execution of the organization s strategy  the skill of an organization s employees and its ability to recruit and retain skilled employees  an organization s intellectual property portfolio  the range of capabilities  from target identification and validation to drug discovery and development to manufacturing and marketing  and the availability of substantial capital resources to fund discovery  development and commercialization activities 
large and established companies such as merck co  inc  glaxosmithkline plc  novartis  inc  sanofi and medimmune inc  among others  compete in the vaccine market 
in particular  these companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support their research and development efforts  conducting testing and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals to market products  and manufacturing such products on a broad scale 
smaller or early stage companies and research institutions may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established pharmaceutical or other companies 
as these companies develop their technologies  they may develop proprietary positions  which may prevent or limit our product commercialization efforts 
we will also face competition from these parties in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials  and in acquiring and in licensing technologies and products complementary to our programs or potentially advantageous to our business 
if any of our competitors succeeds in obtaining approval from the fda or other regulatory authorities for their products sooner than we do or for products that are more effective or less costly than ours  our commercial opportunity could be significantly reduced 
in order to effectively compete  we will have to make substantial investments in manufacturing and sales and marketing or partner with one or more established companies 
there is no assurance that we will be successful in gaining significant market share for any product or product candidate 
our technologies and products also may be rendered obsolete or noncompetitive as a result of products introduced by our competitors to the marketplace more rapidly and at a lower cost 
we may have product liability exposure 
the administration of drugs to humans  whether in clinical trials or after marketing clearances are obtained  can result in product liability claims 
we maintain product liability insurance coverage in the total amount of million for claims arising from the use of our currently marketed products and products in clinical trials prior to fda approval 
coverage is becoming increasingly expensive  however  and we may not be able to maintain insurance at a reasonable cost 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain coverage for the use of our other products in the future 
this insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy liabilities resulting from product liability claims 
a successful claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable items  if at all 
even if a claim is not successful  defending such a claim would be time consuming and expensive  may damage our reputation in the marketplace  and would likely divert management s attention 
if we lose or are unable to attract key management or other personnel  we may experience delays in product development 
we depend on our senior executive officers as well as key scientific and other personnel 
the loss of these individuals could harm our business and significantly delay or prevent the achievement of research  development or business objectives 
we have not purchased key man life insurance on any of our executive officers or key personnel  and therefore may not have adequate funds to find acceptable replacements for them 
competition for qualified employees is intense among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the loss of qualified employees  or an inability to attract  retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the expansion of our activities  could hinder our ability to complete human studies successfully and develop marketable products 
we also rely from time to time on outside advisors who assist us in formulating our research and development and clinical strategy 
we may not be able to attract and retain these individuals on acceptable terms  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have experienced significant management turnover 
our current president and chief executive officer  rahul singhvi  assumed this responsibility in august most of our executive officers have joined us since that time 
this lack of management continuity  and the resulting lack of long term history with our company  could result in operational and administrative inefficiencies and added costs 
if we were to experience additional turnover at the executive level  these risks would be exacerbated 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations 
as of december   we had million of outstanding indebtedness 
our substantial amount of outstanding indebtedness could have significant consequences 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service payments on our indebtedness  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund future capital expenditures  working capital  execution of our growth strategy  research and development costs and other general corporate requirements  could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our other financial obligations if a default under the terms of existing obligations were to occur  could limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  which may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared with competitors that have less indebtedness  and could limit our ability to obtain additional funds  even when necessary to maintain adequate liquidity 
we may incur additional indebtedness for various reasons  which would increase the risks associated with our substantial leverage 
the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt  and the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion or exercise of preferred stock and or warrants or in future offerings would cause dilution of existing security holders interests in the company and may cause the price of our common stock to go down 
as of december   we had outstanding convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of million that as of such date were convertible into an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the issuance of shares of our common stock upon conversion of such notes  as well as in connection with future capital raising activities  would cause immediate and potentially substantial equity dilution for existing stockholders and the price of our common stock could be subject to significant downward pressure 
we have made loans to certain of our directors  which could have a negative impact on our stock price 
on march   pursuant to the novavax  inc stock option plan  the company approved the payment of the exercise price of options by two of its directors through the delivery of full recourse  interest bearing promissory notes in the aggregate amount of  the borrowings accrue interest at per annum and are secured by an aggregate of  shares of common stock owned by the directors 
the notes were payable upon the earlier to occur of the following i the date on which the director ceases for any reason to be a director of the company ii in whole  or in part  to the extent of net proceeds  upon the date on which the director sells all or any portion of the pledged shares or iii payable in full on march  in may  one of these directors resigned from the company s board of directors 
following his resignation the company approved an extension of the former director s  note 
the note continues to accrue interest at per annum and is secured by  shares of common stock owned by the former director and is payable on december   or earlier to the extent of the net proceeds from any sale of the pledged shares 
the terms and interest rate remain unchanged for the promissory note for the active director and is due to be repaid in full on march  due to heightened sensitivity in the current environment surrounding related party transactions  these transactions could be viewed negatively in the market and our stock price could be negatively affected 
our corporate governance policies have been revised and our stock incentive plan prohibits any loans or guarantees to directors  officers or employees 
product development risks because our product development efforts depend on new and rapidly evolving technologies  we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful 
our work depends on new  rapidly evolving technologies and on the marketability and profitability of innovative products 
commercialization involves risks of failure inherent in the development of products based on innovative technologies and the risks associated with drug development generally 
these risks include the possibility that these technologies or any or all of the products based on these technologies will be ineffective or unsafe  or otherwise fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  the products  if safe and effective  will be difficult to manufacture on a large scale or uneconomical to market  proprietary rights of third parties will prevent us or our collaborators from exploiting technologies or marketing products  and third parties will market superior or equivalent products 
we have not completed the development of products other than estrasorb and we may not succeed in obtaining the fda approval necessary to sell additional products 
the development  manufacture and marketing of our pharmaceutical and biological products are subject to government regulation in the us and other countries 
in the us and most foreign countries  we must complete rigorous preclinical testing and extensive human clinical trials that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a product in order to apply for regulatory approval to market the product 
estrasorb is the only product developed by the company to have been approved for sale in the us approval outside the us may take longer or may require additional clinical trials 
we also have product candidates in preclinical laboratory or animal studies 
the steps required by the fda before our proposed investigational products may be marketed in the us include performance of preclinical animal and laboratory tests  submissions to the fda or an investigational new drug application ind which must become effective before human clinical trials may commence  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product in the intended target population  performance of a consistent and reproducible manufacturing process intended for commercial use  submission to the fda of a biologics license application bla or a new drug application nda  and fda approval of the bla or nda before any commercial sale or shipment of the product 
the processes are expensive and can take many years to complete  and we may not be able to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products to the satisfaction of such regulatory authorities 
regulatory authorities may also require additional testing and we may be required to demonstrate that our proposed products represents an improved form of treatment over existing therapies  which we may be unable to do so without conducting further clinical studies 
moreover  if the fda grants regulatory approval of a product  the approval may be limited to specific indications or limited with respect to its distribution 
expanded or additional indications for approved drugs may not be approved  which could limit our revenues 
foreign regulatory authorities may apply similar limitations or may refuse to grant any approval 
consequently  even if we believe that preclinical and clinical data are sufficient to support regulatory approval for our product candidates  the fda and foreign regulatory authorities may not ultimately grant approval for commercial sale in any jurisdiction 
if our drug candidates are not approved  our ability to generate revenues may be limited and our business will be adversely affected 
we must identify products and product candidates for development with our technologies and establish successful third party relationships 
our long term ability to generate product related revenue depends in part on our ability to identify products and product candidates that may utilize our drug delivery and biological technologies 
if internal efforts do not generate sufficient product candidates  we will need to identify third parties that wish to license our technologies for development of their products or product candidates 
we may be unable to license our technologies to third parties for a number of reasons  including an inability to negotiate license terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return from resulting products  an inability to identify suitable products or product candidates within  or complementary to  our areas of expertise  or an unwillingness on the part of competitors to utilize the technologies of a competing company 
our near and long term viability will also depend in part on our ability to successfully establish new strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and government agencies 
establishing strategic collaborations and obtaining government funding is difficult and time consuming 
potential collaborators may reject collaborations based upon their assessment of our financial  regulatory or intellectual property position  government agencies may reject contract or grant applications based on their assessment of public need  the public interest and our products ability to address these areas 
if we fail to establish a sufficient number of collaborations or government relationships on acceptable terms  we may not generate sufficient revenue 
even if we successfully establish new collaborations or obtain government funding  these relationships may never result in the successful development or commercialization of any product candidates or the generation of any sales or royalty revenue 
reliance on such relationships also exposes us to a number of risks 
we may not have the ability to control the activities of our partner and cannot assure you that they will fulfill their obligations to us  including with respect to the license  development and commercialization of products and product candidates  in a timely manner or at all 
we cannot assure you that such partners will devote sufficient resources to our products and product candidates or properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights  we also can give no assurances that our partners will not utilize such rights in such a way as to invite or cause litigation 
any failure on the part of our partners to perform or satisfy their obligations to us could lead to delays in the development or commercialization of products and product candidates  and affect our ability to realize product revenues 
disagreements  including disputes over the ownership of technology developed with such collaborators  could result in litigation  which would be time consuming and expensive  and may delay or terminate research and development efforts  regulatory approvals  and commercialization activities 
if we or our partners fail to maintain our existing agreements or in the event we fail to establish agreements as necessary  we could be required to undertake research  development  manufacturing and commercialization activities solely at our own expense 
these activities would significantly increase our capital requirements and  given our current limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  significantly delay the commercialization of products and product candidates 
even though we have received governmental support in the past  we may not continue to receive support at the same level or at all 
the us government  through its various agencies  has provided grants to fund certain research and development efforts 
there can be no assurances that the company will continue to receive the same level of funding from the us government  if at all 
if we or our collaborators are unable to manufacture our products in sufficient quantities or are unable to obtain regulatory approvals for a manufacturing facility for our products  we may experience delays  and be unable to meet demand  and may lose potential revenues 
completion of our clinical trials and commercialization of our product candidates require access to  or development of  facilities to manufacture a sufficient supply of our product candidates 
we have limited experience manufacturing any of our product candidates in the volumes that will be necessary to support large scale clinical trials or commercial sales 
efforts to establish capabilities  if pursued  may not meet initial expectations as to scheduling  reproducibility  yield  purity  cost  potency or quality 
if we or our collaborators are unable to manufacture our product candidates in clinical quantities or  when necessary  commercial quantities  then we will need to rely on third parties to manufacture compounds for clinical and commercial purposes 
these third party manufacturers must receive fda approval before they can produce clinical material or commercial products 
our products may be in competition with other products for access to these facilities and may be subject to delays in manufacture if third parties give other products greater priority 
in addition  we may not be able to enter into any necessary third party manufacturing arrangements on acceptable terms  or on a timely basis 
there are very few contract manufacturers who currently have the capability to produce our proposed product candidates  and the inability of any of these contract manufacturers to deliver our required quantities of product candidates on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices would negatively affect our operations 
before we or our collaborators can begin commercial manufacturing of any of our product candidates  we or our collaborators must obtain regulatory approval of the manufacturing facility and process 
manufacturing of our proposed product candidates must comply with the fda s current good manufacturing practices cgmp requirements  and non us regulatory requirements 
the cgmp requirements govern quality control and documentation policies and procedures 
in complying with cgmp and non us regulatory requirements  we will be obligated to expend time  money and effort in production  record keeping and quality control to assure that the product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
we or our collaborators must also pass a pre approval inspection before fda approval 
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements  our product candidates would not be approved 
if we or our collaborators fail to comply with these requirements after approval  we would be subject to possible regulatory action and may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell our products 
the fda and non us regulatory authorities also have the authority to perform unannounced periodic inspections of our manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with cgmp and non us regulatory requirements 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers for some of our manufacturing materials 
any problems experienced by any of these suppliers could negatively affect our operations 
we rely on third party suppliers and vendors for some of the materials used in the manufacture of our product candidates 
for supply of early clinical trial materials  we rely on a limited number of suppliers 
any significant problem experienced by one of our suppliers could result in a delay or interruption in the supply of materials to us until such supplier resolves the problem or an alternative source of supply is located 
we have limited experience with alternative sources of raw materials 
any delay or interruption would negatively affect our operations 
we have limited marketing capabilities  and if we are unable to enter into collaborations with marketing partners or develop our own sales and marketing capability  we may not be successful in commercializing any approved products 
we currently have limited sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
as a result  we will depend on collaborations with third parties that have established distribution systems and sales forces 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our revenues will depend upon the efforts of third parties  over which we may have little or no control 
if we are unable to reach and maintain agreements with one or more pharmaceutical companies or collaborators  we may be required to market our products directly 
developing a marketing and sale force is expensive and time consuming and could delay a product launch 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain qualified sales personnel or otherwise develop this capability 
if reforms in the health care industry make reimbursement for our potential products less likely  the market for our potential products will be reduced  and we will lose potential sources of revenue 
our successes may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of therapeutic products and related treatments will be available from third party payers such as government health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care programs  and other organizations 
over the past decade  the cost of health care has risen significantly  and there have been numerous proposals by legislators  regulators  and third party health care payors to curb these costs 
some of these proposals have involved limitations on the amount of reimbursement for certain products 
similar federal or state health care legislation may be adopted in the future and any products that we or our collaborators seek to commercialize may not be considered cost effective 
adequate third party insurance coverage may not be available for us to establish and maintain price levels that are sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
moreover  the existence or threat of cost control measures could cause our corporate collaborators to be less willing or able to pursue research and development programs related to our product candidates 
risks from collaboration relationships and strategic acquisitions the return on our investment in estrasorb depends in large part on the success of our relationship with esprit pharma  inc and our ability to manufacture the product 
in october  we entered into a license agreement and a supply agreement with esprit pharma inc  esprit for estrasorb 
under the license agreement  we granted esprit exclusive rights to market estrasorb in north america 
while our license agreement with esprit gives us some limited protections with respect to that company s estrasorb marketing and sales efforts and  we believe  creates incentives for esprit consistent with our own  we cannot control the amount and timing of the marketing efforts that esprit devotes to estrasorb or make any assurances that esprit s promotion and marketing of estrasorb in north america will be successful 
we do not have a history of working together with esprit and cannot predict the success of the collaboration  nor can we give any assurances that esprit will not reduce or curtail its efforts to market estrasorb because of factors affecting its business or operations beyond our control 
loss of esprit as a partner in the commercialization of estrasorb  any dispute over the terms of our decisions regarding the license and supply agreements  or other adverse developments in our relationship with esprit may harm our business and might accelerate our need for additional capital 
we also can give no assurances that esprit will be more successful than us in gaining market acceptance of estrasorb 
prescription trends for estrasorb have not met our expectations to date and esprit will face similar obstacles to gaining market share of the estrogen therapy market  including competition from large and established companies with similar estrogen therapy products 
numerous companies worldwide currently produce and sell estrogen products for clinical indications identical to those for estrasorb 
currently  the oral and patch product segment account for approximately and of the market  respectively  according to verispan data 
wyeth commits significant resources to the sale and marketing of its product  premarin  in order to maintain its market leadership position 
several other companies compete in the estrogen category including berlex laboratories  inc  novartis pharma ag and solvay pharmaceuticals 
in particular  solvay has introduced an alcohol based gel product  estrogel  which is directly competitive with estrasorb 
these and other products sold by our competitors have all achieved a degree of market penetration superior to estrasorb 
in addition  under the supply agreement  we are obligated to supply esprit with estrasorb through the manufacture of the product at our manufacturing facility in philadelphia  pennsylvania 
we have only limited experience with the large capacity manufacturing required for the commercial sale of a product 
although we have validated our manufacturing methods for the product with the fda  we will remain subject to that agency s rules and regulations regarding cgmp  which are enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
compliance with such rules and regulations requires us to spend substantial funds and hire and retain qualified personnel 
we face the possibility that we may not be able to meet esprit s supply requirements under the agreement in a timely fashion at acceptable quality  quantity and prices or in compliance with applicable regulations 
if our facility fails to comply with applicable regulations  we will be forced to utilize a third party contractor to manufacture the product 
we may not be able to enter into alternative manufacturing arrangements at commercially acceptable rates  if at all 
moreover  the manufacturers we use may not provide sufficient quantities of product to meet our specifications or our delivery  cost and other requirements 
we must utilize our manufacturing facility for products other than estrasorb in order to avoid operating the facility at a loss 
currently we are manufacturing estrasorb at our facility in philadelphia  pennsylvania at a loss and it is likely we will continue to manufacture estrasorb at a loss until production volumes increase or we enter into additional contract manufacturing agreements with third parties to more fully utilize our manufacturing facility s capacity 
the facility is able to accommodate much greater production capacity than its current schedule  which  if more fully utilized  would offset the fixed costs related to the manufacturing process and facility 
in addition  we are negotiating revisions to our agreements for packaging costs of estrasorb as well as our fixed lease costs for the manufacturing facility 
if these negotiations result in higher packaging or lease costs for us  it may have a material adverse impact on future financial results 
our plan to use collaborations to leverage our capabilities and to grow in part through the strategic acquisition of other companies and technologies may not be successful if we are unable to integrate our partners capabilities or the acquired companies with our operations or if our partners do not meet expectations 
as part of our strategy  we intend to continue to evaluate strategic partnership opportunities and consider acquiring complementary technologies and businesses 
in order for our future collaboration efforts to be successful  we must first identify partners whose capabilities complement and integrate well with ours 
technologies to which we gain access may prove ineffective or unsafe 
our current agreements that grant us access to such technologies may expire and may not be renewed 
our partners may prove difficult to work with or less skilled than we originally expected 
in addition  any past collaborative successes are no indication of potential future success 
in order to achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition  we must integrate the acquired company s business  technology and employees in an efficient and effective manner 
the successful combination of companies in a rapidly changing biotechnology industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
the combination of two companies requires  among other things  integration of the companies respective technologies and research and development efforts 
we cannot assure you that this integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of integration are increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations and addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies 
the integration of certain operations will require the dedication of management resource that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day operations of the combined companies 
the business of the combined companies may also be disrupted by employee retention uncertainty and lack of focus during integration 
the inability of management to integrate successfully the operations of the two companies  in particular  to integrate and retain key scientific personnel  or the inability to integrate successfully two technology platforms  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our collaboration agreements may prohibit us from conducting research in areas that may compete with our collaboration products  while our collaborators may not be limited to the same extent 
this could negatively affect our ability to develop products and  ultimately  prevent us from achieving a continuing source of revenues 
we anticipate that some of our corporate or academic collaborators will be conducting multiple product development efforts within each disease area that is the subject of its collaboration with us 
we generally have agreed not to conduct independently  or with any third party  certain research that is competitive with the research conducted under our collaborations 
therefore  our collaborations may have the effect of limiting the areas of research that we may pursue  either alone or with others 
some of our collaborators  however  may develop  either alone or with others  products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of their collaborations with us 
in addition  competing products  either developed by the collaborators or to which the collaborators have rights  may result in their withdrawing support for our product candidates 
generally under our academic collaborations  we retain the right to exclusively license any technologies developed using funding we provided 
if we elect to not license a particular technology  the academic collaborator is typically free to use the technology for any purpose  including the development and commercialization of products that might compete with our products 
because we depend on third parties to conduct some of our laboratory testing and human studies  we may encounter delays in or lose some control over our efforts to develop products 
we are dependent on third party research organizations to conduct some of our laboratory testing and human studies 
if we are unable to obtain any necessary testing services on acceptable terms  we may not complete our product development efforts in a timely manner 
if we rely on third parties for laboratory testing and human studies  we may lose some control over these activities and become too dependent upon these parties 
these third parties may not complete testing activities on schedule or when we request 
we may not be able to secure and maintain suitable research organizations to conduct our laboratory testing and human studies 
regulatory risks we may fail to obtain regulatory approval for our products on a timely basis or comply with our continuing regulatory obligations after approval is obtained 
delays in obtaining regulatory approval can be extremely costly in terms of lost sales opportunities and increased trial costs 
the speed with which we complete our clinical trials and our applications for marketing approval will depend on several factors  including the following the rate of patient enrollment and retention  which is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study and the nature of the protocol  institutional review board approval of the protocol and the informed consent form  prior regulatory agency review and approval  our ability to manufacture or obtain sufficient quantities of materials for use in clinical trials  negative test results or side effects experienced by trial participants  analysis of data obtained from preclinical and clinical activities  which are susceptible to varying interpretations and which interpretations could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval  changes in the policies of regulatory authorities for drug or vaccine approval during the period of product development  and the availability of skilled and experienced staff to conduct and monitor clinical studies and to prepare the appropriate regulatory applications 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing the preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory marketing approvals 
we may not be able to obtain the approvals necessary to conduct clinical trials 
we also face the risk that the results of our clinical trials may be inconsistent with the results obtained in preclinical studies or that the results obtained in later phases of clinical trials may be inconsistent with those obtained in earlier phases 
a number of companies in the specialty biopharmaceutical and product development industry have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after experiencing promising results in early animal and human testing 
furthermore  even if a product gains regulatory approval  such approval is likely to limit the indicated uses for which it may be marketed and the product and the manufacturer of the product will be subject to continuing regulatory review  including adverse event reporting requirements and the fda s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved uses 
failure to comply with any post approval requirements can  among other things  result in warning letters  product seizures  recalls  fines  injunctions  suspensions or revocations of marketing licenses  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions 
any of these enforcement actions  any unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or the adoption of new requirements  or any safety issues that arise with any approved products  could adversely affect our ability to market products and generate revenues and thus adversely affect our ability to continue our business 
we also may be restricted or prohibited from marketing or manufacturing a product  even after obtaining product approval  if previously unknown problems with the product or its manufacture are subsequently discovered and we cannot assure you that newly discovered or developed safety issues will not arise following any regulatory approval 
with the use of any drug by a wide patient population  serious adverse events may occur from time to time that initially do not appear to relate to the drug itself  and only if the specific event occurs with some regularity over a period of time does the drug become suspect as having a casual relationship to the adverse event 
any safety issues could cause us to suspend or cease marketing of our approved products  possibly subject us to substantial liabilities  and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and our financial condition 
because we are subject to environmental  health and safety laws  we may be unable to conduct our business in the most advantageous manner 
we are subject to various laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals  emissions and wastewater discharges  and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research  including infectious disease agents 
we also cannot accurately predict the extent of regulations that might result from any future legislative or administrative action 
any of these laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional expense or restrict our operations 
we have facilities in maryland and pennsylvania that are subject to various local  state and federal laws and regulations relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including chemicals  micro organisms and various hazardous compounds used in connection with our research and development activities 
in the us these laws include the occupational safety and health act  the toxic test substances control act and the resource conservation and recovery act 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge or injury from these materials 
federal  state  and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  these hazardous materials 
in addition  claimants may sue us for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials  and our liability may exceed our total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or production efforts 
although we have general liability insurance  these policies contain exclusions from insurance against claims arising from pollution from chemical or pollution from hazardous 
our collaborators are working with these types of hazardous materials in connection with our collaborations 
in the event of a lawsuit or investigation  we could be held responsible for any injury we or our collaborators cause to persons or property by exposure to  or release of  any hazardous materials 
however  we believe that we are currently in compliance with all applicable environmental and occupational health and safety regulations 
intellectual property risks our success depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
our success in large part depends on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets  including our proprietary drug delivery and biological technologies 
to do so  we must prosecute and maintain existing patents  obtain new patents and pursue trade secret and other intellectual property protection 
we also must operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties or letting third parties infringe our rights 
we currently have over us patents and corresponding foreign patents and patent applications covering our technologies 
however  patent issues relating to pharmaceuticals involve complex legal  scientific and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of biotechnology patent claims that are granted by the us patent and trademark office or enforced by the federal courts 
therefore  we do not know whether our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents  or that any patents issued to us will provide us with any competitive advantage 
we also cannot be sure that we will develop additional proprietary products that are patentable 
furthermore  there is a risk that others will independently develop or duplicate similar technology or products or circumvent the patents issued to us 
there is a risk that third parties may challenge our existing patents or claim that we are infringing their patents or proprietary rights 
we could incur substantial costs in defending patent infringement suits or in filing suits against others to have their patents declared invalid or claim infringement 
it is also possible that we may be required to obtain licenses from third parties to avoid infringing third party patents or other proprietary rights 
we cannot be sure that such third party licenses would be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain required third party licenses  we may be delayed in or prohibited from developing  manufacturing or selling products requiring such licenses 
although our patents include claims covering various features of our products and product candidates  including composition  methods of manufacture and use  our patents do not provide us with complete protection against the development of competing products 
some of our know how and technology is not patentable 
to protect our proprietary rights in unpatentable intellectual property and trade secrets  we require employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators to enter into confidentiality agreements 
these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure 
if we infringe or are alleged to infringe intellectual property rights of third parties  it will adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our research  development and commercialization activities  including any product candidates or products resulting from these activities  may infringe or be claimed to infringe patents owned by third parties and to which we do not hold licenses or other rights 
there may rights we are not aware of  including applications that have been filed but not published that  when issued  could be asserted against us 
these third parties could bring claims against us and that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful against us  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of the product or biologic drug candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or in order to avoid potential claims  we may choose or be required to seek a license from the third party 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we are able to obtain a license  the license would likely obligate us to pay license fees or royalties or both  and the rights granted to us might be nonexclusive  which could result in our competitors gaining access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product  or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations  if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
all of the issues described above could also impact our collaborators  which would also impact the success of the collaboration and therefore us 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
in addition to infringement claims against us  we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings  including interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office and opposition proceedings in the european patent office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
we may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents or the patents of our collaborators or licensors 
as a result  we may be required to file infringement claims to counter infringement for unauthorized use 
this can be expensive  particularly for a company of our size  and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at the risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the us patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications or those of our collaborators or licensors 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management 
we may not be able  alone or with our collaborators and licensors  to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the us furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation 
in addition  during the course of this kind of litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if investors perceive these results to be negative  the market price for our common stock could be significantly harmed 
we may need to license intellectual property from third parties and if our right to use the intellectual property we license is affected  our ability to develop and commercialize our product candidates may be harmed 
we expect that we will need to license intellectual property from third parties in the future and that these licenses will be material to our business 
we will not own the patents or patent applications that underlie these licenses and we will not control the enforcement of the patents 
we will rely upon our licensors to properly prosecute and file those patent applications and prevent infringement of those patents 
while many of the licenses under which we have rights provide us with exclusive rights in specified fields  the scope of our rights under these and other licenses may be subject to dispute by our licensors or third parties 
in addition  our rights to use these technologies and practice the inventions claimed in the licensed patents and patent applications are subject to our licensors abiding by the terms of those licenses and not terminating them 
any of our licenses may be terminated by the licensor if we are in breach of a term or condition of the license agreement  or in certain other circumstances 
our product candidates and potential product candidates will require several components that may each be the subject of a license agreement 
the cumulative license fees and royalties for these components may make the commercialization of these product candidates uneconomical 
if patent laws or the interpretation of patent laws change  our competitors may be able to develop and commercialize our discoveries 
important legal issues remain to be resolved as to the extent and scope of available patent protection for biotechnology products and processes in the us and other important markets outside the us  such as europe and japan 
foreign markets may not provide the same level of patent protection as provided under the us patent system 
we expect that litigation or administrative proceedings will likely be necessary to determine the validity and scope of certain of our and others proprietary rights 
any such litigation or proceeding may result in a significant commitment of resources in the future and could force us to do one or more of the following cease selling or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  which would adversely affect our revenue  obtain a license from the holder of the intellectual property right alleged to have been infringed  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  and redesign our products to avoid infringing the intellectual property rights of third parties  which may be time consuming or impossible to do 
in addition  changes in  or different interpretations of  patent laws in the us and other countries may result in patent laws that allow others to use our discoveries or develop and commercialize our products 
we cannot assure you that the patents we obtain or the unpatented technology we hold will afford us significant commercial protection 
risks related to our common stock and organizational structure because our stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile  the market price of our common stock may be lower or more volatile than you expected 
our stock price has been highly volatile 
the stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
from january  through march   the closing price of our common stock has been as low as per share and as high as per share 
the market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors  including future announcements about our company or our collaborators or competitors  including the results of testing  technological innovations or new commercial products  negative regulatory actions with respect to estrasorb or our product candidates or regulatory approvals with respect to our competitors products  depletion of our cash reserves and or the approach of our convertible debt maturity date if additional revenues are not generated or additional capital is not raised  changes in government regulations  developments in our relationships with our collaboration partners  announcements relating to health care reform and reimbursement levels for new drugs  announcement by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  sales of substantial amounts of our stock by existing stockholders including stock by insiders or stockholders  litigation  public concern as to the safety of our products  significant set backs or concerns with the industry or the market as a whole  and the other factors described in this risk factor section 
the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuation that have particularly affected the market price for many emerging and biotechnology companies 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to be lower or more volatile than expected 
we have never paid dividends on our capital stock  and we do not anticipate paying any such dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently anticipate that we will retain all of our earnings for use in the development of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  of our common stock would be the only source of gain for stockholders until dividends are paid if at all 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws  delaware law  and our shareholder rights plan could delay or prevent the acquisition of the company  even if such acquisition would be beneficial to stockholders  and could impede changes in our board 
our organizational documents could hamper a third party s attempt to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of  the company 
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan  or poison pill  that empowers our board to delay or negotiate  and thereby possibly thwart  any tender offer or takeover attempt the board opposes 
stockholders who wish to participate in these transactions may not have the opportunity to do so 
these provisions also could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for our securities and make it more difficult to change the composition of our board in any one year 
these provisions include the right of the board to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of common stock without any further vote or action by stockholders  the existence of a staggered board with three classes of directors serving staggered three year terms and advance notice requirements for stockholders to nominate directors and make proposals 
the company also is afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law  which will prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of our common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless advance board or stock holder approval was obtained 
any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our board of director or management could deter potential acquirers or prevent the completion of a transaction in which our stockholders could receive a substantial premium over the then current market price for their shares

critical accounting policies and use of estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition and allowances the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulleting no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

for product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company establishes allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns  rebates and charge backs based on historical trends and specifically identified problem accounts 
a large part of the company s product sales are to esprit or to distributors who resell the products to their customers 
the company provides rebates to members of certain buying groups who purchase from the company s distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between the company and the customer  and to state agencies that administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
the company estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of revenue when the company records our sale of the products 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends  distributor inventory levels  product prescription data and generic competition and makes adjustments to the recorded reserves for changes in trends  distributor inventory levels  product prescription data and generic competition and makes adjustments to the recorded reserves based on such information 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement with pharmelle  llc  the company no longer has responsibility for rebates or returns related to avc tm cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart as of the date of the sales of such assets 
under the license and supply agreements with esprit pharma  inc  the company no longer has responsibility for rebates related to estrasorb or returns related to estrasorb sales made subsequent to entering into the license agreement on october  the shipping and handling costs the company incurs are included in cost of products sold in its statements of operations 
for upfront payments and licensing fees related to contract research or technology  the company follows the provisions of sab no 
in determining if these payments and fees represent the culmination of a separate earnings process or if they should be deferred and recognized as revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenue earned under research contracts is recognized in accordance with the terms and conditions of such contracts for reimbursement of costs incurred and defined milestones

this standard requires the company to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for equity share options granted based on the grant date fair value of options 
the cost is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the options 
research and development research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
such costs include internal research and development expenditures such as salaries and benefits  raw materials and supplies and contracted services such as sponsored research  consulting and testing services of proprietary research and development activities and similar expenses associate with collaborative research agreements 
income taxes the company s income taxes are accounted for using the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss carry forward 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the company has provided a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets as of december  and goodwill and intangible assets goodwill originally results from business acquisitions 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
other intangible assets are a result of product acquisitions  non compete arrangements and internally discovered patents 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to impairment tests annually  or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis that includes profitability information  estimated future operating results  trends and other information in assessing whether the value of the indefinite lived intangible assets can be recovered 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company initially tested its goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
the company thereafter performed the required annual impairment test as of december of each year on the carrying amount of its goodwill 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its long lived assets and identifiable intangibles periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
examples of events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the recoverability of the carrying value of an asset should be assessed include but are not limited to the following a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  and or a projection of forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associate with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
the company considers historical performance and anticipated future results in its evaluation of potential impairment 
accordingly  when indicators of impairment are present  the company evaluates the carrying value of these assets in relation to the operating performance of the business and future discounted and undiscounted cash flows is less than the assets carrying value

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years after november  the company is evaluating the impact this new standard will have on its financial position and results of operations 
results of operations for fiscal years  and in thousands  except percentage changes and share and per share information the following is a discussion of the historical consolidated financial condition and results of operations of novavax  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in this annual report on form k 
additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the company s forward looking statements is contained from time to time in the company s sec filings 
change from change from revenues total net product sales contract research and development royalties  milestone and licensing fees revenues for consisted of product sales of million compared to million in  contract research and development revenues of million in compared to million in  and royalties  milestone and licensing fees of million in compared to million in total revenues for were million as compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
the primary reason for this decrease in revenues was the divestiture of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products to pharmelle  llc in september and the licensing of exclusive rights to market estrasorb in north america to esprit pharma  inc in october under the terms of the license and supply agreements with esprit  the company agreed to manufacture and supply estrasorb 
as a result  product sales for consist primarily of estrasorb sales to esprit under the october supply agreement and commercial gynodiol sales 
included in estrasorb net sales for was a million adjustment to the estrasorb sales return allowance for product sold commercially prior to the licensing of estrasorb to esprit 
estrasorb sales were lower than expected for due to weak market demand for this product 
during  esprit established several marketing programs for estrasorb that they anticipate will increase market demand 
contract research and development revenues for totaled million as compared to contract research and development revenues of million 
revenues in the current year were recognized under a national institutes of health nih grant to develop a second generation hiv aids vaccine  three manufacturing contracts and one additional government contract 
royalties  milestone and licensing fees for consisted of million from royalties pursuant to the license agreement with esprit pharma for estrasorb 
this represents a million decrease from million in royalties  milestones and license fees for which consisted of a million renewal fee received from igi  inc in december in accordance with an option in a licensing agreement signed between the company and igi in december this payment gives igi a ten year renewal on licensed technologies in specific fields 
revenues for consisted of product sales of million compared to million in  contract research revenues of million compared to million in  and royalties  milestone and licensing fees of million in compared to million in total revenues for were million compared to million for  a decrease of million or 
of the total decrease in revenues  product sales accounted for million partially offset by a million increase in royalties  milestone and licensing fees 
the reason for the net decrease in net product sales is primarily due to the following in september  we entered into the pharmelle transaction for the sale of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products 
as a result  the vitamin and avc product sales only reflect a partial year of revenues for these product lines 
during  the vitamin lines continued to be negatively impacted by generic products and new product competition 
sales of gynodiol in were lower than the prior year primarily due to an out of stock situation for certain prescription strengths 
in october  we entered into the esprit transaction 
under these agreements  esprit obtained exclusive rights to market estrasorb in north america and the company agreed to manufacture and sell estrasorb to esprit for a lower price than what we previously sold estrasorb to our distributors 
estrasorb net product sales include sales to our distributors through the date of this agreement and to esprit after this date 
contract research revenues in totaled million compared to contract research revenues of million 
royalties  milestone and licensing fees increased by million from million in to million in primarily due to a million license renewal fee received from igi  inc for a ten year renewal on licensed technologies in specific fields 
operating costs and expenses change from change from operating costs and expenses cost of products sold excess inventory costs over market research and development selling and marketing general and administrative facility exit costs gain on sales of product assets gain on redemption of debt cost of products sold and idle capacity cost of products sold  which includes fixed idle capacity costs at our manufacturing facility  decreased to million in compared to million in of the million cost of products sold for  million was due to idle capacity costs at our manufacturing facility compared to million in the remaining million primarily represents the cost of estrasorb sales to esprit under our october supply agreement  gynodiol cost of products sold and costs related to manufacturing contracts 
of the million cost of products sold for  million was due to idle capacity at our manufacturing facility 
idle capacity costs for were million higher than in due partially to the accounting of excess inventory costs over market in  which is discussed in more detail below 
other factors contributing to the decrease in cost of products sold was lower production volumes  the divestiture of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products to pharmelle  llc in september  and lower gynodiol sales in when compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold  which includes fixed idle capacity costs at our manufacturing facility  increased to million in  compared to million in  a increase 
of the million cost of products sold for  million was due to idle plant capacity costs at our manufacturing facility compared to million in the remaining million increase was primarily due to estrasorb  which accounted for of net product sales in  as opposed to of net product sales in  and carries a much higher cost of product sold than our other products 
estrasorb cost of product sold percentages have been and will continue to be high until we increase production volumes for both estrasorb and other manufactured products to offset the fixed costs and depreciation related to the manufacturing facility  on going facility costs and costs associated with the personnel required to manufacture products at this facility 
with the sale of vitamin and avc lines  future cost of products sold will correspond to our estrasorb sales to esprit  gynodiol sales to distributors and manufacturing costs related to other products produced at our manufacturing facility 
until this facility reaches maximum capacity fixed idle capacity costs will continue to be included in cost of products sold 
excess inventory costs over market as part of the october license and supply agreement for estrasorb  we agreed to manufacture and sell estrasorb to esprit pharma  inc at a price that was lower than our current production costs for the inventory manufactured and sold 
these excess costs over the fixed price are being paid under the supply agreement with esprit totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year it is most likely we will continue to manufacture estrasorb at a loss until production volumes increase or we enter into additional contract manufacturing agreements with third parties to more fully utilize our manufacturing facility s capacity 
the current facility is able to accommodate much greater production than is currently scheduled  which  if more fully utilized  would offset the fixed costs related to the manufacturing process and facility 
in addition  we are negotiating revisions to our agreements for packaging costs of estrasorb as well as our fixed lease costs for the manufacturing facility 
if these negotiations result in higher packaging or facility lease costs for us  it may have a material adverse impact on future operating and financial results 
research and development expenses research and development costs increased from million in to million in  an increase of million or 
this increase was due primarily to higher research and development spending to support our strategic focus on creating differentiated  value added vaccines that leverage the company s proprietary virus like particle vlp technology 
research and development expenses were significantly higher in due to increases in personnel  facility and outside testing costs including sponsored research and consulting agreements associated with expanded preclinical testing and process development  manufacturing and quality related programs necessary to move the company s influenza vaccine candidates into clinical testing 
also contributing to this increase was the recognition of million of non cash compensation costs resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
r in  using the modified prospective method  while no costs were recorded in utilizing the accounting recognition methods under apb no 
research and development costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease of million or was due to manufacturing start up costs in being accounted for as research and development expense until april manufacturing costs in the first quarter of totaling million were incurred to prepare and validate the estrasorb facility for current good manufacturing practices and fda compliance and not to build inventory 
beginning in april  manufacturing costs were included in cost of sales and inventory 
vaccine contract research costs  which are included in total research and development expenses  decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to higher costs reimbursed or paid under a government contract in  as well as a reduction in facility costs for estimated cost and time to complete major projects the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   our proprietary product and vaccine candidates were in early stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of product development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for those product candidates 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  but not limited to  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products and vaccines in numerous preclinical studies to identify  among other things  the daily dosage amounts 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above and other risks and uncertainties  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue pursuing our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risks and uncertainties and our liquidity  see item a risk factors and see liquidity and capital resources 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were  in compared to million in this decrease of million  or  was due to our strategy of transitioning from a specialty pharmaceutical company  which included the sale and marketing of products serving the women s health space  to an innovative  biopharmaceutical company focused on creating differentiated  value added vaccines that leverage the company s proprietary vlp technology 
with the sale of our vitamin and avc lines to pharmelle  llc in september and the licensing of estrasorb in north america to esprit in october  our ongoing selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales of gynodiol 
these ongoing costs should be minimal 
selling and marketing expenses were million in compared to million in this significant decrease of million  or  was due to the reduction of the company s sales force in march and the elimination of its remaining sales force in august this corresponded with our strategy of transitioning from a commercial business model to that of one focused on our core competency of new product development 
with the sale of our vitamin and avc lines to pharmelle and the licensing of estrasorb in north america to esprit  the only remaining product that we are selling directly to our distributors is gynodiol 
general and administrative general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in this million increase was partially due to million of non cash compensation costs resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
r in  using the modified prospective method  while no costs were recorded in utilizing the accounting recognition methods under apb no 
other factors contributing to this increase were higher personnel  legal and consulting costs related to the company s vlp based vaccine development programs 
the company took steps to strengthen its intellectual property portfolio and initiate business development and commercial assessment activities related to its new vaccine development strategy 
also included in is a  reserve against a note receivable and its corresponding accrued interest due from a former director of the company 
this reserve represents the difference between the book value of the receivables less the market value of the pledged shares of common stock of the company as of december  the company also made a loan to another director which is due to mature on march  included in general and administrative expense was a  offset for opportunity grant funds received from the commonwealth of pennsylvania for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred with the move of our corporate headquarters and product development activities from maryland to pennsylvania 
as a result of the company s recent decision to relocate its corporate headquarters and vaccine development activities back to maryland  the commonwealth of pennsylvania has demanded repayment of the  opportunity grant received in the company has recorded a liability in reflecting its obligation to repay this amount 
general and administrative costs were million in compared to million in this million decrease  or  is primarily due to receiving million from the commonwealth of pennsylvania for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred with the move to our corporate headquarters and product development activities to malvern  pennsylvania as well as cost saving measures implemented in and this decrease was partially offset by increases in legal fees and business development costs  related to strategic initiatives 
other operating costs and expenses in  we recorded gains on sales of product assets totaling million  which consisted of a million gain from the licensing of exclusive rights to market estrasorb in north america to esprit pharma  inc in october and a million gain from the divestiture of assets related to avc cream and suppositories  novanatal and novastart products to pharmelle  llc in september in  we recorded a one time gain on the redemption of convertible notes held by king pharmaceuticals  inc of million related to the king transaction see summary of significant transactions 
a charge for facility exit costs of million was recorded in as previously described  in september we moved to malvern  pennsylvania to consolidate and expand our corporate headquarters and product development activities 
we vacated our facility in columbia  maryland and recorded a liability of million for lease termination costs and wrote off the net value of the columbia leasehold assets of million 
a further adjustment was made in of million for additional contract termination costs 
interest income expense change from change from interest income expense interest income interest expense interest income was million in and million in and this increase in interest income was due primarily to significantly higher investment balances resulting from the net proceeds from three equity financing transactions during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of which totaled million as well as higher interest rates 
interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense relates primarily to the convertible notes with king pharmaceuticals  inc of million in through july  at which time these notes were redeemed and the company issued new senior convertible notes totaling million to a group of institutional investors 
in october  certain holders of million face amount of the convertible notes exercised their optional right to convert their notes plus accrued interest into  shares of novavax common stock 
this reduced the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding to million as of december  in march  certain holders of million face amount of the convertible notes exercised their optional right to convert their notes plus accrued interest into  shares of novavax common stock 
this further reduced the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding to million as of december  included in interest expense for and is a million and a million write off of deferred financing costs that corresponds to the conversion of million in convertible debt in and million in convertible debt in also included in interest expense for  and is million  million and million  respectively  of amortization of deferred financing costs that corresponds to the issuance of the senior convertible notes in net losses change from change from net loss net loss per share weighted shares outstanding net loss for was million or per share  as compared to million or per share for  an increase of million 
the increased loss was primarily due to the gain on sales of product assets totaling million recorded in also contributing to this higher loss in was a million decrease in revenues  a million increase in operating costs and expenses in support of the company s new vaccine development strategy and million in facility exit costs offset by a million increase in interest income and a million decrease in interest expense  all previously discussed 
net loss for was million or per share  as compared to million or per share for  a decrease of million  or per share 
the decreased loss in was due to the gain on sales of product assets of million  a decrease of million in operating expenses and million in facility exit costs  partially offset by the million decrease in revenues  the gain on redemption of convertible debt held by king pharmaceuticals  inc of million and an increase of million in interest expense  all previously discussed 
weighted shares outstanding increased from million shares in to million shares in due primarily to the equity financing transactions in the second half of and the first quarter of coupled with the conversion of million of senior convertible notes into shares of novavax common stock during this same period 
in addition  exercises of stock options and issuance of restricted stock as compensation also contributed to this increase in weighted shares outstanding 
liquidity and capital resources our future capital requirements depend on numerous factors including but not limited to  the commitments and progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and manufacturing costs related to estrasorb 
we plan to continue to have multiple vaccines and products in various stages of development and we believe our research and development as well as general administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to exceed our revenues 
future activities  particularly vaccine and product development  are subject to our ability to raise funds through debt or equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with industry partners and government agencies 
year ended december  in thousands summary of cash flows net cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year in addition to revenues of million during the three year period ended december   we have funded our operations primarily from the following activities net proceeds in millions total sales of common stock in public offerings  net sales of common stock in a private placement sales of product assets license payments received issuance of convertible notes uses associated with the king transaction exercise of stock options and warrants as of december   we held million in cash and investments as compared to million at december  of the million increase in cash and investments during  million was obtained from financing activities  primarily reflecting proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and million from purchases under the company s stock incentive programs offset by debt repayments of million  million was used for operating activities  consisting of a net loss of million  as previously discussed  offset by non cash activities of million and million generated by the change in operating assets and liabilities  and million was used for investing activities exclusive of short term investment purchases  sales and maturities consisting of general capital expenditures 
as of december   our working capital was million compared to million as of december  this million increase primarily reflects the million net proceeds from two equity financing transactions that occurred during the first quarter of  million from the exercise of stock options offset by million in operating and capital investment activities and million in principal payments on our outstanding debt obligations 
we intend to use the proceeds from our recent equity financing transactions for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to our internal research and development programs  such as preclinical and clinical testing and studies for our vaccine and other product candidates  the development of new technologies  capital improvements and general working capital 
in the first quarter of  we entered into sponsored research and licensing arrangements with two academic institutions to conduct early stage research in the vaccine area 
these and similar arrangements that we may enter into may aggregate to a material amount of research and development spending that will accelerate the use of such proceeds 
we will continue to fund our operations through product licensing  co development arrangements on new products  or the public or private sale of securities of the company 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional capital or  if such capital is available  that the terms of any financing will be satisfactory to the company 
as of december   the company had million of senior convertible notes outstanding the notes 
the notes carry a coupon  are currently convertible into shares of novavax common stock at per share  and mature on july  the note holders have the right to redeem all or a portion of the notes if the weighted average price of the company s common stock is less than the then applicable conversion price currently per share of the company s common stock on each of trading days out of the consecutive trading days immediately prior to either the third anniversary july  or the fourth anniversary july  of the issue date of the notes 
if the note holders exercise their optional redemption right  the company may elect to pay up to per cent of the outstanding notes being redeemed in shares of common stock 
the redemption of the company s senior convertible notes would have an adverse effect on the company s current cash position and its ability to fund its operations 
based on our assessment of the availability of capital and our business operations as currently contemplated  in the absence of new financings  any potential redemption of notes  licensing arrangements or partnership agreements  we believe we will have adequate capital resources into the second half of if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will continue to assess our capital resources and we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our product research and development programs  downsize our organization  or reduce general and administrative infrastructure 
contractual obligations and commitments we utilize different financing instruments  such as debt and operating leases  to finance various equipment and facility needs

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million as follows cash and cash equivalents million short term investments million our exposure to market risk is confined to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio of investment grade government agency notes and corporate bonds 
the securities in our investment portfolio are classified as held until maturity securities and are  due to their predominantly short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk

we are headquartered in the us where we conduct the vast majority of our business activities 
accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
at december   the company had a total debt of million  most of which bears interest at fixed interest rates 
the company therefore does not believe that it is exposed to any material interest rate risk as a result of its borrowing activities
