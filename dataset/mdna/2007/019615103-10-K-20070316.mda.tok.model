overview we are a national provider of specialty pharmacy and disease management services focused on hiv aids patients 
we sell hiv aids medications  ancillary drugs and nutritional supplies under our trade name moms pharmacy 
we work closely with physicians  nurses  clinics and aids service organizations  or asos  and with government and private payors  to improve clinical outcomes and reduce treatment costs for our patients 
most of our patients rely on medicaid and other state administered programs  such as the aids drug assistance program  or adap  to pay for their hiv aids medications 
we believe that the combination of services we offer to patients  healthcare providers and payors makes us an attractive source of specialty pharmacy and disease management services  contributes to better clinical outcomes and reduces overall healthcare costs 
our services include the following specialized momspak prescription packaging that helps reduce patient error associated with complex combination therapies  reimbursement experience that assists patients and healthcare providers with the complex reimbursement processes and that optimizes collection of payment  arrangement for the timely delivery of medications as directed by our patients or their physicians in a discreet and convenient manner  specialized pharmacists who consult with patients  physicians  nurses and asos to provide education  counseling  treatment coordination  clinical information and compliance monitoring  and information systems and prescription automation solutions that make the provision of clinical data and the transmission of prescriptions more efficient and accurate 
geographic footprint 
we operate our business as a single segment configured to serve key geographic areas most efficiently 
in  we completed two acquisitions in california and two acquisitions in new york 
we will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they arise in both our existing markets and markets where we do not currently have operations 
as of december   we operated ten distribution centers  which are located strategically in california six separate locations  new york two separate locations  florida and washington to serve major metropolitan areas in which high concentrations of hiv aids patients reside 
in discussing our results of operations  we address changes in the net sales contributed by each of these distribution centers because we believe this provides a meaningful indication of the historical performance of our business 
we ceased operating our austin  texas distribution center as of june  a significant portion of the operations of our austin  texas distribution center was dedicated to serving organ transplant and oncology patients 
consistent with our strategy of focusing on the hiv aids market  we decided not to continue this business 
we did not record any material expense associated with the discontinuance of these operations and the closing of our austin  texas facility 
in  our austin  texas distribution center contributed approximately million of net sales to our financial results 
as a result of our decision to discontinue our texas operations  we have presented the results of the texas distribution center as discontinued operations 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  we have restated prior periods to reflect the presentation of the texas facility as discontinued operations  so that period to period results are comparable 

table of contents net sales 
as of december   approximately of our net sales came from payments directly from government sources such as medicaid  adap  and medicare excluding part d  described below  which is administered through private payor sources 
these are all highly regulated government programs subject to frequent changes and cost containment measures 
we continually monitor changes in reimbursement for hiv aids medications 
on december   the mma was signed into law 
this legislation made significant structural changes to the federal medicare program  including the establishment of a new medicare part d outpatient prescription drug program 
effective january  under the mma  medicaid coverage of prescription drugs for medicaid beneficiaries who were also eligible for medicare transitioned to the medicare program 
these beneficiaries  referred to as dual eligibles  are now enrolled in the medicare pdps 
we have agreements with most of these pdps to provide prescription drugs to dual eligible beneficiaries that are our patients 
typically  the pdps provide a lower reimbursement rate than the rates we received from the medicaid programs 
in december  approximately of our patients received coverage under a medicare pdp 
gross profit 
our gross profit reflects net sales less the cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold is the cost of pharmaceutical products we purchase from wholesalers 
the amount that we are reimbursed by government and private payors has historically increased as the price of the pharmaceuticals we purchase has increased 
however  as a result of cost containment initiatives prevalent in the healthcare industry  private and government payors have reduced reimbursement rates  which prevent us from recovering the full amount of any price increases 
for the year ended december   we recorded income of  from continuing operations 
our income is primarily attributed to increases in gross profit from acquisitions 
our gross profit increased while our overall gross margin declined 
in  our acquisitions increased our focus on hiv aids patients  which reduced the relative contribution to gross profit provided by one of our operations  north american home health supply  or nahh  which we had acquired in january nahh experiences a much higher gross margin due to a product mix that is reimbursed at higher amounts than the hiv aids medications we sell  however  the purchasers of these higher margin products are primarily not hiv aids patients 
consequently  as this business unit becomes a smaller percentage of our overall business  our gross margin will continue to decline to a level more consistent with our lower margin hiv aids operations 
for the three month period ended december   nahh represented of our total net revenue 
while we believe that we now have a sufficient revenue base to continue to operate profitably given our anticipated operating and other expenses  our business remains subject to uncertainties and potential changes that could result in losses 
in particular  changes to reimbursement rates  unexpected increases in operating expenses  difficulty integrating acquisitions or declines in the number of patients we serve or the number of prescriptions we fill could adversely affect our future results 
for a further discussion regarding these uncertainties and potential changes  see item a 
risk factors in this annual report 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses are made up of both variable and fixed costs 
variable costs increase as net sales increase 
our principal variable costs are labor and delivery 
fixed costs do not vary directly with changes in net sales 
our principal fixed costs are facilities  equipment and insurance 
we have grown our business by acquiring other specialty pharmacies and expanding our existing business 
we will continue to evaluate acquisitions and to continue to expand our existing business 
since the beginning of  we have acquired seven specialty pharmacies in california and two specialty pharmacies in new york 
we also generate internal growth primarily by increasing the number of patients we serve and filling more prescriptions per patient 
critical accounting policies management believes that the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies  which the sec defines as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often because management must make estimates about uncertain and changing matters 
our critical accounting policies affect the amount of income and expense we record in each period as well as the value of our assets and liabilities and our disclosures regarding contingent assets and liabilities 
in applying these critical accounting policies  we make estimates and assumptions to prepare our financial statements that  if made differently  could have a positive or negative effect on our financial results 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are both reasonable and appropriate  in light of applicable accounting rules 
however  estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could differ materially from estimates
