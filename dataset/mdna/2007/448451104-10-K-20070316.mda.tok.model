item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview huttig is a distributor of building materials used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement  remodeling  and repair work 
as of march   we distribute our products through distribution centers serving states and sell primarily to building materials dealers  national buying groups  home centers and industrial users  including makers of manufactured homes 
industry conditions various factors historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
these factors include levels of construction  home improvement and remodeling activity  weather  prices of commodity wood and steel products  interest rates  competitive pressures  availability of credit and other local  regional and economic conditions 
many of these factors are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
we anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
our first quarter and fourth quarter are generally adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which typically result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
because much of our overhead and expenses remain relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
we believe we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success 
our future revenues  costs and profitability  however  are all likely to be influenced by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those in item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates and assumptions 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends as well as management forecasts 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consist of amounts owed for orders shipped to customers and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
huttig s corporate management establishes an overall credit policy for sales to customers and is responsible for all credit decisions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a number of factors including when customer accounts exceed days past due or sooner depending on the credit strength of the customer 
our credit policies  together with monitoring of customer balances  have resulted in average bad debt expense of less than of net sales during each of the last three years 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
we review inventories on hand and record a provision for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on historical and expected sales 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we test the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the discounted cash flow is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other long lived assets  including intangible and other tangible assets  for impairment when events and circumstances warrant such review 
the carrying value of long lived assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
contingencies we accrue expenses when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the expense 
contingencies for which we have made accruals include environmental  product liability and other legal matters 
it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period and our financial condition could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances related to these matters 
we accrue an estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and make adjustments to the amounts accrued as circumstances change 
insurance we carry insurance policies on insurable risks with coverages and other terms that we believe are appropriate 
we generally have self insured retention limits and have obtained fully insured layers of coverage above such self insured retention limits 
accruals for self insurance losses are made based on our claims experience 
we accrue for these liabilities for existing and unreported claims when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and when we can estimate those costs 
supplier rebates we enter into agreements with certain vendors providing for inventory purchase rebates upon achievement of specified volume purchasing levels 
we record vendor rebates as a reduction of the cost of inventory purchased 
income taxes we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time to resolve 
we regularly review our potential tax liabilities for tax years subject to audit 
changes in our tax liability occurred in and may occur in the future as our assessment changes based on the progress of tax examinations in various jurisdictions and or changes in tax regulations 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years presented 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax benefits or liabilities attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates would be recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance when we believe that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in operations and the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans under which employees and directors may be granted awards 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
generally  no compensation expense was recognized for fixed option plans because the exercise prices of employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market prices of the underlying stock on the dates of grant 
however  prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r  share based compensation had been included in pro forma disclosures in the financial statement footnotes for periods prior to effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
among other items  sfas r eliminated the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and required companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
stock based awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 except that stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the statement of operations 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the estimate may materially change because it depends on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted  the market value of our common stock as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our stock price  volatility  risk free interest rate  dividend rate and employee stock option exercise behaviors and the related tax impact 
sfas r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if actual forfeitures vary from our estimates  we will recognize the difference in compensation expense in the period the actual forfeitures occur or when options vest 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales from continuing operations were  million in  which were million higher than our net sales increased increase in the first half of over which increase was mostly offset by a decline in the second half of over when the housing market began to decline 
new housing starts in the united states decreased to approximately million in from million in  including million single family residences in versus million in  based on data from the us census bureau 
we anticipate decreased housing starts in versus based on the current level of housing activity and industry forecasts for by product category  sales increased in millwork and building products  compared to and declined in wood products 
millwork sales increased in to million led by interior doors and columns  which increases were partially offset by a decrease in window sales

gross margin decreased approximately to million or of sales in as compared to million or of sales in the results include a million  or of sales  impact from charges related to the impairment of inventory associated with the exit of a wood decking product line and the conversion of six branches to a new exterior door vendor and from liquidating inventory at our closed branches 
these items decreased gross margin percentage by approximately one half of a percentage point in in addition  the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted from lower gross margins on exterior and interior doors and building products and higher customer rebates as compared to operating expenses increased million to approximately million or of sales in  compared to approximately million or of sales in operating expenses for include million of expenses related to the decision to discontinue the implementation of  and write off capitalized costs associated with  a new enterprise resource planning system  million of expenses  primarily severance and lease termination  associated with the shut down and consolidation of five branches during the third and fourth quarters of  and million related to severance cost associated with other workforce reductions in addition to the reductions in force associated with the branch closures and consolidation 
operating expenses in also reflected increased wage and benefit costs  fuel costs and building and equipment rent partially offset by lower incentive compensation costs 
with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we recorded total stock based compensation expense of million in compared to million in the results for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of a facility of million 
net interest expense was million in compared to in primarily due to higher libor based borrowing rates in versus in addition  in  we refinanced our previous credit agreement and recorded a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related this credit agreement and a million gain on a related interest rate swap in place on the prior credit facilities 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income loss for the years ended december  and were approximately and  respectively 
in  the benefit for certain state tax net operating loss carry forwards increased by million  but was offset by a million increase in the related valuation allowance  resulting in a million net reduction to the overall income tax benefit 
as a result of the foregoing factors  we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million in as compared to income from continuing operations of million in fiscal compared to fiscal continuing operations net sales from continuing operations were  million in  which were million  or approximately  higher than our branch in dallas  which we acquired in january  and to a lesser extent  our new branches in atlanta  minneapolis  and long island accounted for over one half of the net sales increase in same branch sales increased by approximately in over  primarily as a result of increased millwork and building products sales 
by product category  sales increased in millwork and building products  compared to and remained relatively flat in wood products

gross margin increased approximately to million or of sales in as compared to million or of sales in gross margin as a percentage of sales in benefited from higher gross margins on exterior and interior doors  an improved product mix and higher vendor rebates  which was partially offset by lower gross margins on mouldings and lower gross margins at our new dallas branch 
the dallas branch has a higher mix of lower margin direct sales and decreased our gross margin as a percentage of sales by 
operating expenses increased million to approximately million or of sales in  compared to approximately million or of sales in dallas and the other new branches accounted for approximately million of this increase 
same branch personnel expenses increased approximately million reflecting higher wage and benefit costs  partially offset by reduced incentive compensation expense

in october  the company s leased facility in riviera beach  florida suffered significant damage as a result of hurricane wilma 
this facility did not re open until july we recorded a million loss in the fourth quarter due to damages to the riviera beach facility and its contents 
the results for the year ended december  included a gain on the sale of a facility of million 
in  we recognized a million gain on disposal of capital assets from the sale of facilities  as we moved into larger  leased facilities 
net interest expense was million in and in addition  during the third quarter of  we refinanced our previous credit agreement and recorded a non cash charge of million to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related this credit agreement 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income for the year ended december  and were approximately and  respectively 
the effective tax rate benefited from the closure of multi year tax audits allowing us to eliminate certain tax accruals 
as a result of the foregoing factors  income from continuing operations increased to million in from million in discontinued operations results from discontinued operations in the year ended december  reflect sales of million by our builder resource one step branches and an after tax gain of million on the february  divestiture of the remaining three one step branches 
sales from discontinued operations in the year ended december  were million  operating profit was million  and net income was million 
discontinued operating results in included american pine products  our former mouldings manufacturer  and all of the builder resource branches  some of which were sold later in liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures and any acquisitions that we may undertake 
our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters  which reflect the seasonal nature of our business 
the second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters  largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters 
we typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters 
we also maintain significant inventories to meet rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers 
at december  and  inventories constituted approximately and of our total assets  respectively 
we also closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and  to the extent possible  manage variable operating costs to minimize seasonal effects on our profitability 
operations 
cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations decreased by million to million for the year ended december   from million in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities primarily reflects the decreased profitability in accounts receivable decreased by million during compared to an increase of million a year ago 
days sales outstanding improved slightly by days to days at december  from days at december  based on annualized fourth quarter sales for the respective periods 
inventory decreased during by million compared to an increase of million in our inventory turns decreased to turns in from turns in accounts payable decreased by million during compared to a million increase in the year ago period

cash used in investing activities of million for reflects million used for the acquisition of texas wholesale and million of capital expenditures for normal  continuing operating activities 
the uses of cash in investing activities in were partially offset by million of proceeds from the disposition of our remaining builder resource locations in alabama  tennessee  and kansas  million of proceeds from the sale of our manchester  new hampshire facility and million of proceeds from the sale of various other equipment 
financing 
cash provided by financing activities of million reflects net borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit and term facilities and million from the exercise of stock options  which were partially offset by payments of million for our capital lease obligations and other obligations and debt issuance costs of million 
cash used in financing activities of million for reflects million of net payments on our term and revolving credit facilities and million of payments for our capital lease and other obligations  which were partially offset by million of proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
on october   the company entered into new five year million asset based senior secured revolving credit facility new credit facility and repaid all amounts outstanding under its prior credit agreement 
the new agreement increases borrowing availability and reduces both the libor margin pricing and financial covenant monitoring 
borrowing availability under the new credit facility is based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
the company has the right to add a real estate component to increase borrowing availability  but not in excess of the million commitment 
additionally  the new agreement includes an option to request an increase in the size of the facility by up to an additional million  subject to certain conditions and approvals 
the company must also pay a fee in the range of to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit commitment 
the entire unpaid balance under the new agreement is due and payable on october   the maturity date of the credit agreement 
at december   under the new credit facility we had revolving credit borrowings of outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of  letters of credit outstanding totaling million  primarily for health and workers compensation insurance  and million of additional borrowing capacity 
in addition  we had of capital lease and other obligations outstanding at december  the borrowings under the new credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets and are subject to certain operating limitations applicable to a loan of this type  which  among other things  place limitations on indebtedness  liens  investments  mergers and acquisitions  dispositions of assets  cash dividends and transactions with affiliates 
the financial covenant in the new facility is limited to a fixed charge coverage ratio to be tested only when excess borrowing availability is less than million and on a pro forma basis prior to consummation of certain significant business transactions outside the company s ordinary course of business and prior to increasing the size of the facility 
in connection with the closing of the new credit facility  the company terminated an interest rate swap agreement  scheduled to mature in september  associated with the term loan under the prior credit facility 
the interest rate swap termination resulted in a gain of million that partially offset a charge of million to write off unamortized costs associated with the prior loan facility 
both the gain and write off were recognized in the fourth quarter 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and funds available under our credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our currently anticipated short term and long term liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 
off balance sheet arrangements in addition to funds available from operating cash flows and our bank credit facility as described above  we use operating leases as a principal off balance sheet technique 
operating leases are employed as an alternative to purchasing certain property  plant and equipment 
future rental commitments  extending through the year  under all non cancelable operating leases in effect at december  total million 
divestitures during  we sold our remaining builder resource one step branches  and certain assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  equipment and real property for million in cash and reported an after tax gain of million 
the after tax gain is included in net income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  we used the proceeds of the sale to pay down debt and trade payables 
we reported these branches as discontinued operations and related assets were classified as held for sale effective december  acquisition during the first quarter of  we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  huttig texas limited partnership  completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of texas wholesale building materials for million in cash  million in guaranteed payments to the former majority owner and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the source of funds for the acquisition was our existing credit facility 
commitments and contingencies the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions payments due by period total beyond long term debt  including current portion capital lease obligations operating lease obligations guaranteed payments purchase obligations total amounts represent the expected cash payments of our long term debt and do not include any fair value adjustments 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt approximates book value because interest rates on nearly all of the outstanding borrowings are reset every to days 
amounts represent guaranteed payments related to the acquisition of texas wholesale building materials  inc on january  on august   we sold to woodgrain millwork  inc substantially all of the assets  but excluding the land  buildings and building improvements  of american pine products  a mouldings manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon 
we also entered into a non exclusive supply agreement with woodgrain under which we have agreed to purchase mouldings  doors  windows  door frames and other millwork products from woodgrain for a period of five years at market prices 
in through  the supply agreement requires that we purchase a certain minimum unit volume of certain products from woodgrain and that woodgrain sell such products at competitive market prices 
the minimum volume requirements represent less than half of our current overall requirements for such products 
if woodgrain is unable to meet our needs  we believe such products are readily available from other suppliers new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition

sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards required or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects

sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheet and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
early application of the guidance in sab is encouraged in any report for an interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sab to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition

these forward looking statements are based on current projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments  and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to those set forth under item a risk factors 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risk as it relates to effects of changes in interest rates 
we had debt outstanding at december  under our new credit facility of million 
all of our debt under our revolving credit facility accrues interest at a floating rate basis 
if market interest rates for libor had been different by an average of for the year ended december   our interest expense and income before taxes would have changed by million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
this analysis does not consider the effects of any change in the overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management may take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
we are subject to periodic fluctuations in the price of wood  steel commodities  petrochemical based products and fuel 
profitability is influenced by these changes as prices change between the time we buy and sell the wood  steel or petrochemical based products 
profitability is influenced by changes in prices in fuel 
in addition  to the extent changes in interest rates affect the housing and remodeling market  we would be affected by such changes
