item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a note regarding forward looking statements 
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 
we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators  which provide other leisure options including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines  both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to cruise passengers 
our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation plc  which owns  among others  carnival cruise lines  princess cruises  holland america line  costa cruises  p o cruises  and cunard line  star cruises  which owns  among others  star cruises and norwegian cruise line  mediterranean shipping company  which owns msc cruises  and disney cruise line 
in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
overcapacity within the cruise vacation industry  a reduction in demand or geo political and economic uncertainties could have a negative impact on revenues  result in impairment of assets and may adversely affect profitability 
cruising capacity has grown in recent years and we expect it to increase further as the major cruise vacation companies introduce new ships 
demand for cruises has been and is expected to continue to be dependent on the strength of the economies in the countries in which we market our products  the public s attitude towards the safety of travel and the geo political climate 
economic or political changes may reduce demand for cruise vacations and may lead to reduced occupancy and or price discounting which  in turn  could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could result in impairment of our asset values 
fears of terrorist attacks  war and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our profitability 
events such as terrorist attacks  war and other hostilities  the spread of contagious diseases and the resulting political instability  travel restrictions and concerns over safety  health and security aspects of traveling have had  and could have in the future  a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry 
these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and  therefore  increase our shipboard employee costs 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and profitability 
the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents  illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction and thereby adversely affect future industry performance 
incidents involving cruise ships  adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our profitability 
environmental  health and safety  financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 
the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry 
some environmental groups have lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
in addition  we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards on board our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
we may not be able to obtain financing on terms that are favorable or consistent with our expectations 
to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  we rely on a combination of cash flows provided by operations  drawdowns under our available credit facility  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sales of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets 
our credit ratings impact our ability to obtain financing in financial markets and the terms of the financing 
any lowering of our credit ratings may have adverse consequences on our ability to access the financial markets and or on our cost of financings 
in addition  interest rates and our ability to obtain financing are dependent on many economic and political factors beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot be sure that our cash flows from operations and additional financings will be available in accordance with our expectations 
conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 
we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence 
operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks 
examples include political risks and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising  vacation or maritime businesses  or governing the operations of foreign based companies 
additional risks include currency fluctuations  interest rate movements  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we are unable to address these risks adequately  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have ship construction contracts  which are denominated in euros 
while we have entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts  we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged 
if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract  any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated 
termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 
ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises and unscheduled drydocks and repairs 
we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order 
the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks 
delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships 
shipyard insolvency and other industrial actions could also delay or indefinitely postpone the timely delivery of new ships 
we have experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future 
these events together with any related adverse publicity could  to the extent they are not covered by contractual provisions or insurances  adversely affect our financial results 
our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or political factors beyond our control 
our operating costs  including fuel  food  payroll  insurance and security costs  are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control 
increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  united states state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes 
the implementation of these and other taxes could also cause an increase in our costs 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our profits 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call could adversely affect our profits 
a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code may have adverse effects on our income 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business and or from sources within the united states 
drinker biddle reath llp  our united states tax counsel  has delivered to us an opinion  based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it  to the effect that this income  to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships  is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 
in  final regulations under section became effective  which narrowed somewhat the scope of activities that are considered by the internal revenue service to be incidental to the international operation of ships 
to the extent the income from non incidental activities is earned from sources within the united states  that income will be subject to united states taxation  but the determination of the precise amount of such untied states source income involves some uncertainties 
the tax impact of these new regulations reduced our net income for the year ended december  by approximately million and we anticipate tax impacts in subsequent years on an ongoing basis 
it should also be noted that the provisions of section are subject to change at any time by legislation 
moreover  changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity  residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders that could affect our eligibility for the section exemption 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future 
if we were not entitled to the benefit of section  we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships  which would reduce our net income 
see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section finally  changes in the income tax laws affecting our cruise business in malta  the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our cruise operations  resulting in lower net income 
we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies  management and actions requiring shareholder approval 
as of february   a 
wilhelmsen as  a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway  owned approximately of our common stock and cruise associates  a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family  owned approximately of our common stock 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates have the power to determine  among other things our policies and the policies of our subsidiaries  the persons who will be our directors and officers  and actions requiring shareholder approval 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders agreement 
the agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of the following persons four nominees of a 
wilhelmsen as  four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer 
during the term of the shareholders agreement  certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a 
wilhelmsen as 
and one director nominated by cruise associates 
our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business  subject to certain exceptions 
if any person other than a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates  our two principal shareholders  acquires ownership of more than of our common stock and our two principal shareholders  in the aggregate  own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect  or to designate for election  at least a majority of the board of directors  we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities  which we may be unable to replace on similar terms 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
the holders of our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their equity interest as a result of the sale of currently restricted shares of our common stock into the public market 
a substantial number of shares of our common stock were either issued by us in private transactions not involving a public offering or are held by our affiliates and  therefore the sale of these securities is subject to restrictions under the securities act of securities act 
these shares include the shares of our common stock held by a 
wilhelmsen as 
and the held by cruise associates 
no predictions can be made as to the effect  if any  that market sales of such shares  or the availability of such shares for future market sales  will have on the market price of our common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perceptions that such sales could occur  could materially adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
each of a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates has the right  pursuant to a registration rights agreement  to require us  subject to certain qualifications  to effect the registration under the securities act of all or part of their shares of common stock which would allow these shares to be sold into the public market 
we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 
our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and by laws and by the business corporation act of liberia 
the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states 
however  while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes  there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia 
for example  the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions 
thus  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management  directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction
