the expansion into california  which had been webster s largest unserved market  was particularly successful and made a solid contribution to webster s fiscal and sales results 
further expansion of webster s geographic marketplace is anticipated in the future 
emphasizing value added  full service capabilities 
webster believes that veterinary customers value full service and responsive delivery of product  in addition to competitive prices 
customers also increasingly expect suppliers to be knowledgeable about products and services  and generally a superior sales representative can create a special relationship with the practitioner by providing an informational link to the overall industry 
webster s knowledgeable sales representatives assist customers in the selection and purchasing of supplies 
most veterinarians are independent  or small unit based  practitioners who are unable to store and manage large volumes of supplies in their offices 
webster meets its customer s requirements by delivering frequent  small quantity orders rapidly and reliably from its strategically located distribution centers 
continuing to improve operating efficiencies 
webster continuously pursues opportunities to lower costs and improve efficiencies 
as of april  webster shares three distribution facilities with one or both of the other operating units 
in addition  a customer system that can be used by multiple business segments but maintains the same look and feel of the emagine system has been fully deployed within the unit 
the new system provides customer support staff with integrated customer information on one screen 
broaden the product line 
webster continuously seeks to broaden its portfolio of product offerings to maximize the opportunities within its existing customer base 
for example  in the past year webster s expansion of its product offerings included the entire companion animal products lines of bayer animal health and novartis animal health  the parasiticides tri heart plus  iverhart plus and iverhart max  clavamox small animal antibiotic  the line of purina veterinary diets  continuum feline vaccines  calicivax feline vaccines  sogeval dermatolgic products  reconcile separation anxiety medication for dogs  the snap dx diagnostic test  the small animal nutraceutical dasuquin  equine vaccines prevenile and prestige iv foal shot  dickies medical uniforms and the exclusive products opticide disinfectant and caniplas canine plasma 
webster also strives to consistently introduce innovative products 
in fiscal  webster successfully launched its private label initiative to supply veterinary customers with quality consumable goods white goods  exam gloves  sutures  surgical blades and microscope slides at value prices 
private label offerings have been expanded since the initial launch and are expected to continue to grow 
management believes that product innovation allows webster to maintain its competitive position and helps fuel internal growth 
management also believes that its emphasis on new product offerings enables its sales force to remain effective in creating demand among veterinarians 
broadening the product line also includes bringing new  innovative services to the customer to allow them to generate greater revenues and profitability from their practice 
as webster continues to expand and build its equipment business  it has added clinic and hospital design capabilities and technical service personnel to install and repair equipment that is sold by webster as well as by others

the balance of veterinary equipment is distributed in a fashion similar to consumable supplies 
other other products and services include commissions on agency sales  equipment repair revenues  software maintenance contract revenue and freight recovery on shipments to customers 
sales and marketing a primary component of webster s value added approach is its sales force 
due to the fragmented nature of the veterinary supply market  webster believes that a large sales force is necessary to reach potential customers and to provide full service 
sales representatives provide an informational link to the overall industry  assist practitioners in selecting and purchasing products  and help customers efficiently manage their supply inventories 
each representative works within an assigned sales territory under the supervision of a location branch manager 
sales representatives are employees and are generally compensated on a commission basis  with some  less experienced  representatives receiving a base salary and commission 
to assist its sales representatives  webster publishes a catalog  which contains approximately  skus

selected consumable supplies  new products  specially priced items and high demand items are promoted through merchandise fliers printed and distributed monthly

in order to meet the rapid delivery requirements of customers  most consumable products are delivered within hours 
webster estimates that approximately of its consumable orders are delivered to the customer on time 

table of contents sources of supply webster obtains products from nearly vendors

in fiscal and  webster s top veterinary supply manufacturers comprised and  respectively  and the single largest supplier comprised and  respectively  of the total cost of veterinary supply sales 
competition within the companion pet market segment  competitors range from small local distributors to large national and regional full service companies  and to a lesser extent  mail order distributors or buying groups 
webster also competes directly with pharmaceutical companies who sell certain products directly to the customer 
the company approaches its markets by emphasizing and delivering a value added model to the practitioner 
to differentiate itself from its competition it deploys a strategy of premium customer service  a highly qualified and motivated sales force  an extensive breadth and mix of products and services  accurate and timely delivery of product  strategic location of sales offices and competitive pricing

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s fiscal financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes 
the following background is essential to more fully understand the company s financial information 
patterson operates a distribution business in three complementary markets dental supply  veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply 
historically the company s strategy for growth focused on internal growth and the acquisition of smaller distributors and businesses offering related products and services to the dental market 
in fiscal  the company expanded its strategy to take advantage of a parallel growth opportunity in the veterinary supply market by acquiring the assets of j 
a 
webster  inc on july  the company added a third component to its business platform in fiscal when it entered the rehabilitation supply market with the acquisition of abilityone products corp 
abilityone on september  abilityone is now known as patterson medical 
the historical operating performance of the veterinary supply and rehabilitation supply businesses are somewhat different than the dental supply business 
operating margins of the veterinary business are considerably lower than the dental supply business 
while operating expenses run at a lower rate in the veterinary business  its gross margin is substantially lower 
veterinary gross margins have been in the low to mid s as compared to dental gross margins in the mid s 
the rehabilitation business has realized gross margins in the high s to low s 
there are several important aspects of the company s business  including market growth in the various markets it operates  internal growth  growth through acquisition  and continued focus on controlling costs and enhancing efficiency  that are useful in analyzing the company 
management defines internal growth as the increase in net sales from period to period  excluding the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  and excluding the net sales  for a period of twelve months following the transaction date  of businesses that it has acquired 
with these factors in mind  management has established certain operating objectives  which include increasing net sales four percentage points faster than the average market growth rate at each business unit and improving operating margins by basis points annually 
in response to lower than expected operating results at patterson medical  the company put a new management team into place during the second half of fiscal in fiscal  the company committed a portion of its operating leverage improvement to investments in the sales and marketing organization at patterson medical  which entailed a significant expansion of the sales force as well as other marketing initiatives 
the actions in fiscal at patterson medical were expected to diminish the opportunity to expand operating margins by basis points 
in addition  fiscal operating results include expense of million from the adoption of fasb statement no 
r at the beginning of the year 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the consolidated results of operations over the past three fiscal years as a percent of sales a net sales cost of sales gross margin operating expenses operating income other income  net interest expense income before taxes income taxes net income a includes a basis point impact of share based compensation expense from the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for the year ended april  totaled  million  an increase of from  million in fiscal the favorable impact of foreign currency translation on sales growth was 
acquisitions contributed approximately one percentage point to sales growth 
the company acquired accu bite in september this business included both a field sales organization similar to our traditional dental sales model  as well as a low margin telesales business 
for approximately eight months of fiscal  from the date of acquisition through the end of fiscal year  the dental segment operated accu bite s telesales business 
in early may  the telesales operations were closed for business reasons 
in closing the business  as much of the sales volume that could be  was moved into the field organization 
however  as the company expected  much of this sales volume went to dental suppliers who approach the market with a low price model 
the closing of the telesales business had a negative impact on consolidated fiscal sales growth of approximately one percentage point 
sales of our dental supply unit increased in fiscal to  million 
sales of dental consumable supplies grew 
the accu bite telesales negative impact on sales growth of the dental unit s total sales and sales of consumable supplies was approximately and  respectively 
equipment sales grew  led by basic equipment growth of 
largely offsetting the increase in basic equipment growth was a decline in the sales of cerec d dental restorative systems 
late in the third quarter of fiscal  cerec s manufacturer  sirona  introduced several important enhancements 
first  cerec s software was significantly improved  making it easier to design highly aesthetic and precise restorations  while also greatly streamlining the system s learning curve 
in addition  a faster and more robust milling unit was introduced as an option on new installations  as well as an upgrade to all existing cerec users 
the company believes the news of the impending enhancements to cerec  which reached the market early in fiscal  as well as the timing of the introduction at the end of the third fiscal quarter  and the process of transitioning to these upgraded features  which was still underway at the end of fiscal  had a negative impact on sales throughout the year 
other dental sales  consisting primarily of technical service parts and labor  software support services and teeth  grew in fiscal 
table of contents sales at the webster veterinary unit grew to million from million 
the business has strategically emphasized expansion of its value added platform  including its equipment and software initiatives 
webster s core consumables business performed well throughout the year and equipment and software increased 
excluding the acquisition impact of intra corp  developer and marketer of intravet practice management software  total veterinary sales exceeded prior year sales by 
patterson medical consistently grew sales throughout the year  improving over fiscal three acquisitions related to the unit s branch office strategy contributed percentage points of the growth and foreign currency translation added an additional of sales improvement 
during fiscal patterson medical established five full service branch offices in selected markets through acquisitions and internal start ups 
additional acquisitions and internal start ups are under consideration as the business continues to increase its sales force and add programs and systems to advance their value added offerings 
gross margin 
consolidated gross margin declined basis points in fiscal to  primarily due to lower margins of patterson medical 
in addition  the sales growth of webster veterinary outpaced both the dental and rehabilitation segments  resulting in a dilutive impact to consolidated gross margin  since veterinary gross margins are lower than the other two businesses 
the dental segment s gross margin improved basis points in fiscal the closing of the accu bite telesales business which operated for eight months in fiscal and was dilutive to overall dental gross margin during that period  acted to improve dental gross margins in the telesales business produced substantially lower gross margins than the traditional dental sales operations 
a decline in sales of the high margin cerec dental restorative systems during fiscal negatively impacted gross margin 
the gross margin of the veterinary business decreased by basis points over fiscal year the negative impact on gross margin of lower agency commissions and vendor rebates in fiscal was mostly offset by the sales growth of equipment and software  which carry higher margins than core consumables 
patterson medical s gross margin declined basis points due to several factors 
higher freight costs have impacted this business more than the dental and veterinary segments due to the nature of the average order size and related package levels 
in addition  this segment has fixed price contracts with certain large group customers and price increases from vendors created some margin compression in this customer group 
these contracts are renewed periodically  at which time pricing may be renegotiated to address changes in vendor pricing 
many of the contracts were amended in the latter part of fiscal a third factor in the gross margin decline at patterson medical is that the business hired a number of new sales representatives during the past fiscal year who have been given some short term latitude to establish their book of business through discretionary discounting 
this latitude will be phased out as these new representatives reach their sales targets 
operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio remained unchanged from a year ago at  however the ratio in fiscal was negatively impacted by basis points due to million of share based compensation expense related to the company s adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal excluding the impact of sfas no 
r  the dental segment experienced a basis point improvement in its operating expense ratio 
the veterinary segment experienced a basis points decrease in its operating expense ratio  due primarily to leverage on sales growth 
in addition  during fiscal the business incurred costs from the initial expense structure of its greenfield expansion into california 
fiscal was a year of investment for patterson medical in sales and marketing personnel and programs  however the business was able to maintain their operating expense ratio due to growth in sales 
operating income 
operating income was million  or of net sales 
excluding million of expense under sfas no 
r  operating income was of net sales  totaling million  an increase of from million in fiscal 
table of contents interest expense 
interest expense was million compared to million in fiscal for more than half of fiscal  an interest rate swap on million of variable rate debt effectively fixed interest rate expense on the million at until the agreement terminated in november the average debt balance carried in fiscal was lower than fiscal  however  the weighted average interest rate on the million of variable rate debt was approximately in fiscal  resulting in an overall increase in interest expense 
other income  net 
other income  net of other expenses  increased to million from million 
composed primarily of finance interest income in both years  the increase was due primarily to higher interest rates 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in fiscal year compared to in the prior year 
during fiscal  the company finalized several years of canadian income tax returns and the reversal of related tax reserves lowered the effective income tax rate by approximately one percentage point 
the impact of sfas no 
r on our effective tax rate partially offset the finalization of the canadian tax returns since certain compensation expense under sfas no 
r is non deductible 
earnings per share 
earnings per diluted share of represents an increase of or from the earnings per share reported in fiscal the adoptions of sfas no 
r in fiscal lowered earnings per share by 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales for the year ended april  totaled  million  an increase from  million reported for the previous year 
the company utilizes a fifty two  fifty three week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in april 
due to the company s fiscal year policy  fiscal included an additional or fifty third week as compared to fiscal the company estimates the additional week in fiscal had a one to two percentage point adverse impact on the growth rate in fiscal sales of our largest business unit  dental supply  increased 
excluding the impact of the accu bite acquisition and favorable foreign currency exchange translation related to our canadian operations  sales grew approximately in fiscal sales of dental consumable supplies experienced strong growth of 
excluding the percentage point impact to growth from the accu bite acquisition  and considering the additional week in fiscal  consumables growth was on the high end of our of estimated market growth rate of to 
equipment sales growth of was below historic norms 
in the second half of fiscal  programs were implemented to improve the sluggish sales performance for basic equipment  such as chairs  units  cabinetry and lights  back to more historic growth rates 
with respect to new technology equipment  digital radiography continued to see significant practitioner demand and related sales grew compared to fiscal sales of the cerec d dental restorative system were virtually unchanged from fiscal sales of other services and products  including parts  technical service  software support and insurance e claims  grew in fiscal sales at the webster veterinary unit grew to million from million 
the impact from the october milburn and december intravet acquisitions was approximately million  or percentage points of the growth 
webster s sales growth was strong throughout the year and was complimented by several factors 
first  the business began its greenfield expansion into the large california market  which represents its most successful greenfield initiative to date 
second  for the past few years  webster has been 
table of contents laying the groundwork for expanding its position in the equipment market and this growing emphasis resulted in strong results 
equipment sales for the year grew from fiscal finally  another source of growth in fiscal sales were new pharmaceutical distribution agreements  including a canine pain medication previously sold direct by the manufacturer 
patterson medical s sales growth was only 
a modest improvement in north american sales was largely offset by a slight decline in sales of the overseas operations 
in the second half of fiscal  a new management team was put in place and a range of strategic initiatives were begun 
late in the third quarter  a small  non core portion of the segment was sold which also negatively impacted the growth rate of sales 
gross margin 
consolidated gross margin declined basis points in fiscal to 
sales from the webster veterinary unit made up a larger portion of sales in fiscal due to its strong sales growth 
because gross margin at the veterinary unit is lower than both the dental and medical units  the unit s sales growth had a dilutive effect on consolidated gross margin 
the dental unit s gross margin decrease of nearly basis points was largely due to the acquisition of accu bite 
acquired territory sales reps were integrated within existing patterson branches  however  accu bite also had a telesales operation that was not integrated and produced substantially lower gross margins than the traditional dental sales operations 
the telesales business was shutdown in early may of  however  it did operate from the september date of acquisition through the end of fiscal the gross margin of the veterinary business was virtually unchanged 
a full year of milburn operations  which carry lower margins than the historical webster business  were included in fiscal results compared to approximately six months in fiscal and negatively impacted the overall gross margin of the unit 
however  this impact was largely offset by the sales growth of equipment and software  which carry higher margins than the rest of the unit s product offerings 
patterson medical s gross margin fell basis points  largely due to sales mix  including lower sales levels of the overseas operations  which have carried higher gross margins than the north american operations 
operating expenses 
the consolidated operating expense ratio decreased to  down basis points from in fiscal the dental segment experienced a basis point decrease  reflecting operating leverage on additional sales and reduced incentive compensation 
this improvement was partially offset by costs associated with the integration of the accu bite acquisition 
the veterinary segment also improved its operating expense ratio by basis points  due primarily to operating leverage on improved sales 
costs associated with the initial expense structure of the california greenfield expansion somewhat offset this improvement 
the operating expense ratio at patterson medical declined by basis points due to lower levels of amortization of intangibles 
consolidated amortization expense in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively 
the million decrease was due primarily to amortization on certain intangible assets related to the acquisition of patterson medical  some of which were being amortized on an accelerated basis due to their period of benefit 
operating income 
operating income increased and decreased basis points as a percent of sales 
as discussed above  consolidated gross margins declined basis points  while the consolidated operating expense ratio improved basis points 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased from million to million 
the average debt balance carried in fiscal was lower than in fiscal because the company paid down substantial amounts of debt near the end of fiscal however  in november  an interest rate swap on million of variable rate debt terminated 
this swap had existed throughout all of fiscal and under the terms of the agreement  the company effectively paid a low  fixed rate on the variable rate debt 
due to the termination of the swap agreement and rising interest rates  the company experienced a higher weighted average interest rate in fiscal and was not able to recognize significantly lower levels of interest expense as compared to fiscal other income  net 
other income  net of other expenses  was consistent year over year 
composed primarily of finance interest income in both years  net other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and results primarily from the growth of the business 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was in both fiscal years and the company s effective tax rate is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily because of state  local and international taxes the company must pay 
earnings per share 
earnings per share increased to  up or from the earnings per share reported in fiscal liquidity and capital resources patterson s operating cash flow has been the company s principal source of liquidity in fiscal   and operating activities generated cash of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the company did not sell approximately million of short duration finance contracts that were generated as a part of our traditional calendar year end financing programs 
these contracts have an average maturity of less than months and will generate interest income at rates approximating what cash would earn  thus the company elected not to incur the administrative expense of selling these contracts 
had these contracts been sold  cash from operations would have been approximately million 
the majority of the principal balance on these contracts has been collected from customers as of fiscal year end 
capital expenditures were  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
fiscal included several significant projects  including expenditures for shared distribution centers in kent  wa and eastern pennsylvania 
in addition  included expenditures for a new distribution facility for the patterson medical operations in the uk the company expects to invest approximately million in capital expenditures during fiscal  including the expansion of an existing distribution center to accommodate multiple business units  and the continuing expansion of information systems 
two buildings were sold during fiscal  with proceeds totaling million 
one building was the former distribution facility for patterson medical s uk operations and the other was a vacant building acquired in the acquisition of abilityone 
cash used for acquisitions totaled million in fiscal and included the acquisition of three dealer distributors by patterson medical as well as earn outs on acquisitions from previous years 
the million invested in fiscal included the acquisitions of accu bite and intracorp 
in fiscal  the company used million of cash for acquisitions  including medco  caesy and milburn 
a cash payment of million was made to sirona in fiscal  representing a distribution fee that extends the company s exclusive north american distribution agreement of sirona s cerec equipment for a ten year period which begins in october 
table of contents the company did not repurchase any of its common stock in fiscal years  or  but does have authorization from the board of directors to repurchase up to six million shares 
this authorization expires september  during fiscal  the company loaned its esop million  which was used by the esop to purchase approximately million shares of the company s common stock on the open market 
payments on long term debt were million in fiscal in addition to million of fixed rate debt that matured during the year and million of scheduled payments on its variable rate bank term loans  the company paid off the remaining million of the term loans near the end of the fiscal year 
an amount of million is available to the company under this revolving credit facility until november for fiscal  million of fixed rate private notes loan repayments are scheduled 
management continues to expect funds generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments to be sufficient to meet the company s working capital needs for the next fiscal year 
the company expects to continue to obtain liquidity from the sale of its equipment finance contracts 
the company s short term and long term debt facilities are believed to be adequate as a supplement to internally generated cash flows to fund anticipated expansion plans and strategic initiatives 
the company sells a significant portion of its installment sale contracts to a commercial paper funded conduit managed by a third party bank  and as a result  commercial paper is indirectly an important source of liquidity for the company 
the company is allowed to participate in the conduit due to the quality of its finance contracts and its financial strength 
cash flow could be impaired if the company s financial strength diminished to a level that precluded the company from taking part in this facility or other similar facilities

outlook over the last ten years  the company has been able to grow revenue and earnings through its strategy of emphasizing its value added  full service capabilities  using technology to enhance customer service  continuing to improve operating efficiencies  and growing through internal expansion and acquisitions 
the company s growth strategy will continue to focus on these key elements 
maintaining financial flexibility is also a key component of the company s future growth 
with strong operating cash flow and available credit capacity  the company is confident that it will be able to financially support its future growth 
the strategic initiatives that the company has implemented in the past two years  as well as those that will be implemented in fiscal and beyond  will strengthen the company s operational platform and contribute to continuing future growth 
given these factors  the company considers itself well positioned to capitalize upon the growth opportunities in the dental supply  companion pet veterinary supply and the worldwide rehabilitation supply markets 
the company believes that the sustainable  long term growth rate of its north american dental operation is four percentage points in excess of the market s to estimated rate of growth 
the company also believes its webster

asset management the following table summarizes the company s days sales outstanding dso and inventory turnover the past three fiscal years days sales outstanding inventory turnover the inventory values used in this calculation are the lifo inventory values for all inventories except for manufactured inventories and foreign inventories  which are valued using fifo inventory methods 
foreign operations foreign sales are derived primarily from patterson dental and patterson medical operations in canada and from patterson medical s operations in the uk and france 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates have not significantly impacted earnings 
however  net sales in fiscal  and were enhanced by changes in the exchange rate 
without foreign currency effects  net sales would have been million  million and million lower in fiscal years  and  respectively 
changes in currency exchange rates are a risk accompanying foreign operations  but this risk is not considered material with respect to the net operations of the company s business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has adopted various accounting policies to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management believes that the company s policies are conservative and its philosophy is to adopt accounting policies that minimize the risk of adverse events having a material impact on recorded assets and liabilities 
however  the preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments regarding the realization of assets and the settlement of liabilities based on the information available to management at the time 
changes subsequent to the preparation of the financial statements in economic  technological and competitive conditions may materially impact the recorded values of the company s assets and liabilities 
therefore  the users of the financial statements should read all the notes to the consolidated financial statements and be aware that conditions currently unknown to management may develop in the future 
this may require a material adjustment to a recorded asset or liability to consistently apply the company s significant accounting principles and policies that are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the financial performance and condition of the company may also be materially impacted by transactions and events that the company has not previously experienced and for which the company has not been required to establish an accounting policy or adopt a generally accepted accounting principle 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition processes involve establishing estimates for returns  damaged goods  rebates and other revenue allowances 
these estimates are based on historical experience and the facts known at the date of the preparation of the financial statements  but future events could cause actual results to vary from our estimates 
inventory and reserves inventory consists primarily of merchandise held for sale and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for all inventories  except for foreign inventories and manufactured inventories  which are valued using the first in  first out fifo method 
we continually assess the valuation of our inventories and reduce the carrying value of those inventories that are 
table of contents obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to estimated realizable value 
we estimate the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of businesses acquired 
other intangible assets include customer lists  a distribution agreement and other amortizable intangible assets 
in addition  other intangible assets consist of trademarks and trade names that are unamortized intangible assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill for each reporting unit be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
the company has three reporting units at april  the company tests goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
in the first step  the company compares the fair value of each reporting unit  as computed primarily by present value cash flow calculations  to its book carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and the company would then complete step in order to measure the impairment loss 
in step  the company would calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets including unrecognized intangible assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  the company would recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference 
management also reviews other intangible assets with finite lives for impairment at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist that would indicate impairment 
if the carrying value of the finite lived intangible assets exceeds the expected undiscounted cash flows resulting from the use and disposition of the asset  the carrying value is written down to fair value in the period identified 
indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of the assets and comparing with their carrying value 
in assessing fair value  management generally utilizes present value cash flow calculations using an expected cash flow approach 
during the fourth quarters of fiscal and  management completed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment reviews with no impairments to the carrying values identified 
the discount rate and sales growth assumptions are the two most significant assumptions utilized in the company s calculations of the present value cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the reporting units when performing the annual goodwill impairment test and in testing indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the company utilizes an expected cash flow approach in estimating the fair value of the reporting units  where the discount reflects a risk free rate of interest and utilizes various probability weighted scenarios to estimate future sales 
the cash flow model used to derive fair value is most sensitive to the discount rate and sales growth assumptions used 
the estimated fair value of the reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets has historically exceeded the carrying value of such reporting unit or indefinite lived intangible asset by a substantial amount 
the company performs a sensitivity analysis on the discount rate  sales growth and operating margin assumptions 
either the discount rate could be increased by of the discount rate utilized  or the sales growth assumption could be reduced by  and the company s reporting units and indefinite lived intangible assets would continue to have fair values in excess of the carrying values 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with sfas no 
r 
the company recognizes share based compensation based on certain assumptions including inputs within the black scholes model and estimated forfeitures 
these assumptions require subjective judgment and changes in the assumptions can materially affect fair value estimates 
management assesses the assumptions and methodologies used to estimate forfeitures and to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation on a regular basis 
circumstances may change  and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to market risk consisting of foreign currency rate fluctuations and changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in its operating statement due to transactions denominated primarily in canadian dollars  british pounds and euros 
although historically the company has elected not to enter into any hedging contracts  it continually evaluates its foreign currency exchange rate risk and the different mechanisms for use in managing such risk 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar in relation to the company s most significant foreign currency exposures would have had an impact of approximately million on fiscal net sales 
this amount is not indicative of the hypothetical net earnings impact due to the partially offsetting impact of the currency exchange movements on cost of sales and operating expenses 
the company s earnings are also affected by fluctuations in short term interest rates through the investment of its cash balances  borrowings under libor based debt instruments and the practice of selling fixed rate equipment finance contracts under agreements with both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks that provide for pricing based on variable interest rates 
as of april   the company had million of long term debt outstanding of which million was variable interest rate based debt 
the company views its variable interest rate debt position on a net basis that gives effect to the company s cash and short term investments balances 
when considering the exposure under the agreements whereby the company sells equipment finance contracts to both a commercial paper conduit and a group of banks  the company has the ability to select pricing based on interest rates ranging from day libor up to twelve month libor 
in addition  the portfolio of installment contracts generally turns over in less than months and the company can adjust the rate it charges on new customer contracts at any time 
therefore  in times where the interest rate markets are not rapidly increasing or decreasing  the average interest rate in the portfolio generally moves with the interest rate markets and thus would parallel the underlying interest rate movement of the pricing built into the sale agreements 
in calculating the gain on the contract sales  the company uses an interest rate curve that approximates the maturity period of the then outstanding contracts 
if increases in the interest rate markets occur  the average interest rate in our contract portfolio may not increase at the same rate  resulting in a reduction of gain on the contracts sales as compared to the gain that would be realized if the average interest rate in our portfolio were to increase at a more similar rate to the interest rate markets 
the company estimates that if interest rates had been higher during the year  the annual impact would have been to reduce earnings before income tax by approximately million
