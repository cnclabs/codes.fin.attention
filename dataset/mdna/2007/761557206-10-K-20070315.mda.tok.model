overview we are a leading provider of marketing services  business intelligence  loyalty programs and access to capital to the restaurant industry 
thousands of restaurants across north america benefit from our services 
we link our participating restaurants to members of our loyalty programs by marketing participating restaurants to members and providing members with incentives to dine at participating restaurants 
we attract members to our loyalty programs through our website  www 
rewardsnetwork 
com  and relationships with leading airline frequent flyer programs  clubs and other affinity organizations 
we market participating restaurants to members through the internet  email and print marketing 
we offer business intelligence to participating restaurants by providing aggregate data regarding members activity  including member feedback through surveys 
we also offer customer loyalty programs by providing loyalty rewards to members when they dine at participating restaurants 
we provide access to capital by purchasing a portion of future member transactions from participating restaurants in bulk and in advance 
bars and clubs also participate in our programs  and for purposes of describing our business  are included when we use the term restaurants 
we are paid for our services and  if applicable  receive the portion of a member s transaction that we have purchased only if a member dines at a participating restaurant when loyalty rewards are available and pays using a payment card that the member has registered with us 
our revenue is equal to a percentage of the member s total dining transaction amount 
these revenues are applied to recover our costs where we have purchased a portion of future member transactions  provide loyalty rewards to members  cover our selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  and generate operating income that provides a return for our stockholders 
we primarily offer two programs to restaurants our marketing services program and marketing credits program 
our marketing services program provides restaurants with marketing  business intelligence and loyalty programs 
in addition to these services  our marketing credits program provides restaurants with access to capital through our purchase of a portion of future member transactions 
during the fourth quarter of  we revised our marketing credits program contracts to provide that we purchase a portion of future member transactions instead of dining credits that are used by members when they dine at participating restaurants 
in discussing our business  we continue to use the term dining credits to refer to the portion of future member transactions that we purchase 
our revised contracts also provide for a separate fee for marketing  business intelligence and loyalty services 
we include all components of the marketing credits program  including the payment for marketing  business intelligence and loyalty services  in marketing credits program sales and revenues because we analyze our business in this manner 
since the middle of  our management team has worked to position us for profitable and sustainable growth 
during  we focused on rebuilding and investing in our people  processes and overall strategy 
as part of investing in our people  we upgraded our management team and that effort is effectively complete 
we began rebuilding and investing in processes and overall strategy in mid by initiating more conservative marketing credits program policies and raising the profitability of our deals 
we also augmented our due diligence and risk assessment procedures 
in conjunction with these initiatives  we moved away from selling our programs to restaurants based on price to selling our programs based on the value of our marketing  business intelligence and loyalty programs to a restaurant 
we also improved the ways in which we demonstrate the value of our programs to restaurants  including by delivering the voice of the member to our restaurants through post dine surveys and other ways of providing member feedback to restaurants 

table of contents the emphasis on rebuilding and investing in our people  processes and overall strategy is reflected in the following developments in revised sales policies and procedures beginning in mid  we revised our marketing credits program policies to increase the profitability of our deals 
we also augmented our due diligence and risk assessment procedures for marketing credits deals so that we could better understand the impact of marketing credits deals on our business 
these revised marketing credits program policies and due diligence and risk assessment procedures were in place throughout throughout  our revised marketing credits program policies resulted in a shorter period of time for members to use dining credits and higher profitability of our deals with restaurants than under our previous policies 
these policies have resulted in an estimated time to use dining credits of approximately months for the year ended december   down from months in mid deal profitability has increased due to an improvement in sales yield in the marketing credits program compared to mid cost of sales as a percentage of marketing credits program sales has remained basically the same since mid we believe that the marketing credits program deals entered into throughout reflect better financial characteristics  including profitability and lower risk of write off  than under our previous policies 
the increase in net revenues in over is a reflection of the higher profitability of our deals 
however  the decrease in our restaurant count is due in part to restaurants deciding not to enter into deals that reflect our revised marketing credits policies 
throughout  we employed stricter due diligence and risk assessment procedures for marketing credits deals 
as a result of our ability to better assess the impact of a potential marketing credits deal on our business  we elected not to renew marketing credits deals with certain participating restaurants or enter into deals with new restaurants that did not bring value to our business 
as a result of our revised marketing credits program policies and due diligence and risk assessment procedures  during we reduced our overall volume of dining credits for two principal reasons we purchased fewer dining credits at a given time from a restaurant and fewer restaurants participated in our marketing credits program 
consistent with this decrease in our dining credits portfolio and our marketing credits program policies  the time we expect that members will use the dining credits has shortened 
these factors have resulted in a decrease in our provision for losses 
in  the loss provision was of sales 
with the implementation of balanced risk analysis and due diligence  we believe that our dining credits portfolio will increase in the future and as the period for usage of dining credits lengthens  the loss provision expense should increase toward levels of approximately to of sales 
this increase in the loss provision expense could adversely affect our financial results when compared to the loss provision 
because the time period for members to use dining credits that we purchase from an individual restaurant in was shorter than under our previous marketing credits program policies  the restaurant renewal cycle was shortened  resulting in increased renewal activities by our sales force 
this accelerated renewal cycle has impacted our ability to grow the restaurant base and has increased the chance that a restaurant could decide not to renew its deal with us at an earlier point 
as a result  some restaurants that we desire to retain in our program decide not to renew and exit our program earlier than under our previous marketing credits program policies 
we are implementing more balanced risk analysis and due diligence in an effort to be selective in purchasing more dining credits and lengthening usage periods  where appropriate 
these changes are designed to increase retention of desirable restaurants without sacrificing the risk profile of the dining credits portfolio 
sales force development the decrease in the number of marketing credits program restaurants during was due in part to restaurants deciding not to enter into deals that reflect our revised marketing credits policies and are more profitable to us 
in order to address the decline in restaurant count  we developed a new sales approach and related sales training programs  shifting from price driven selling to consultative  value based selling aimed at matching our product set to our restaurant customers needs 
we believe that value based selling and related sales training programs are important in selling our more profitable products to restaurants by better preparing our sales personnel to articulate the value of our marketing  business intelligence services  loyalty programs and access to capital 
as part of our focus on value based selling  we modified the sales compensation plan to compensate our sales personnel based on the profitability of our deals with restaurants  as opposed to overall revenues 

table of contents during  we also increased our sales force in an effort to increase the number of participating restaurants 
by the end of  we had hired additional sales employees to fully staff our sales force 
newly hired sales employees typically take six months to be reasonably effective in the field 
we believe that we could have offset a portion of the decrease in our merchant count in if we had a fully staffed sales force throughout the year 
demonstrating the value of our programs to restaurants in addition to developing our sales force  we increased our efforts to demonstrate the value of our services in an effort to retain and attract restaurants 
we enhanced our business intelligence capabilities and the business intelligence reports that we provide to restaurants to demonstrate the value of our marketing and loyalty services 
these business intelligence reports also provide information that our participating restaurants can use to improve their businesses 
we also improved our efforts to set restaurant expectations regarding member activity prior to entering into a deal because we believe that proper expectations will increase acceptance of deals that are more profitable for us and will lead to a better relationship with a restaurant while it participates in our programs 
in connection with demonstrating the value of our programs to restaurants  we also expanded the ways in which we deliver the voice of the member to restaurants 
we believe that restaurants value qualified customer feedback and that our relationship with members allows us to deliver valuable feedback to our restaurants 
during  we expanded the number of members who can complete post dine surveys and provide feedback to participating restaurants 
we are developing other ways to link members to restaurants by asking members for feedback on restaurants 
for example  in connection with our efforts to retain restaurants  we reach out to members who have dined at restaurants that have either left or are considering leaving our program so that we can provide feedback to these restaurants regarding members likelihood to dine at the restaurant after it leaves our program 
also  during we surveyed members about their dining habits and analyzed member behavior in an effort to improve our program for both members and merchants 
we believe that our focus during on rebuilding and investing in our people  processes and overall strategy has positioned us for profitable and sustainable growth 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the allowance for dining credits losses  the valuation allowance  if any  for net deferred tax assets  investments and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for dining credits losses we provide allowances for dining credits losses based on our estimate of losses that would result from the inability of participating merchants to remain in business or our merchant s unwillingness to honor their obligations relating to dining credits 
if the financial condition of our merchant base were to deteriorate beyond our expectations  resulting in participating merchants inability to provide food  beverage  goods and services to members thereby reducing the members use of dining credits  or if merchants are unwilling or otherwise unable to honor their obligations relating to dining credits in greater numbers than we expect  additional allowances may be required 
we review members ability to use dining credits on a regular basis and provide for anticipated losses on dining credits 
losses are reduced by recoveries of dining credits previously written off 
account balances are charged off 
table of contents against the allowance after we believe that our merchants are unwilling or unable to honor their obligations relating to dining credits 
subsequent to the account being written off  we continue to pursue recovery efforts 
deferred tax assets valuation allowance we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is not likely to be recognized due to cumulative losses and the uncertainty as to future recoverability 
we consider future taxable income and available tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period in which such determination is made 
impairment loss of unamortized goodwill on at least an annual basis  we evaluate whether events and changes in circumstances warrant the recognition of an impairment loss of unamortized goodwill 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of unamortized goodwill include a significant  sustained negative trend in our operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for our programs  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future cash flows 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results that are used in the preparation of projected cash flows  and  if different conditions prevail or judgments are made  a material write down of goodwill could occur 
we comply with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the current standard for periodic assessment of the carrying value of intangible assets  including goodwill 
we assess the impact of sfas no 
using a two step approach to assess goodwill based on applicable reporting units and any intangible assets  including goodwill  recorded in connection with our previous acquisitions 
during the three months ended march   certain territories related to reacquired franchises experienced a significant decline in sales related to unanticipated competition and the loss of key salespersons in these territories which contributed to an operating loss for the quarter 
these financial results  coupled with several changes in senior sales management in the three months ended march   gave rise to our need to reassess the goodwill related to the reacquired franchises 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we prepared a discounted cash flow analysis which indicated that the book value of certain reporting units exceeded their estimated fair value and that goodwill had been impaired 
accordingly  we recognized a non cash impairment loss of  during the three months ended march  as of december   we had unamortized goodwill of  revenue recognition we recognize revenue when members patronize our participating merchants and pay using a payment card they have registered with us 
revenue is recognized only if the member s transaction qualifies for a benefit in accordance with the rules of the member s particular program 
the amount of revenue recognized is that portion of the member s total transaction amount that we are entitled to receive in cash  in accordance with the terms of our agreement with the participating merchant 
for example  if a member s total qualified transaction amount is at a participating merchant  as evidenced by the full amount of the payment card transaction  and our contract provides for us to receive  the amount of revenue we recognize is  representing what we will actually realize in cash 
similarly  under the typical marketing services program contract  we recognize revenue only to the extent that we are contractually entitled to receive cash for a portion of the member s total qualified transaction amount 
the same transaction referred to above at a marketing services program merchant may yield in revenue to be recognized 
legal contingencies we review the status of significant legal matters and assess our potential financial exposure with respect to such legal matters on at least a quarterly basis 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered 
table of contents probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
results of operations comparison of and as a means of better explaining our operations and results  the following table illustrates the relationship between revenue and expense categories for and these percentages have been rounded to the nearest tenth 
percentage of sales sales cost of sales provision for losses member benefits net revenue membership fees and other income total operating revenue salaries and benefits sales commission and expenses professional fees member and merchant marketing expenses goodwill impairment general and administrative expenses litigation and related expenses total operating expenses operating loss income other expense  net loss income before income tax benefit provision income tax benefit provision net loss excludes legal fees related to litigation and related expenses 
table of contents operating revenues the following table sets forth for the periods presented our sales  components of our costs of sales and certain other information for each of our two marketing programs 
as discussed in part i  item  business  in the fourth quarter of we changed our marketing credits program so that we purchase future member receivables instead of dining credits 
reference to dining credits in this discussion refers to both dining credits purchased under our previous marketing credits program structure and future member receivables under our current structure 
we use the term merchant in this discussion to refer to restaurants  bars and clubs 
marketing marketing marketing marketing credits services credits services program program total program program total merchant count as of december  and  respectively number of qualified transactions average transaction amount qualified transaction amount sales yield sales cost of dining credits processing fee total cost of sales provision for dining credits losses member benefits bonus rewards partner commissions total member benefits net revenue in analyzing sales  we focus on three key metrics merchant count  qualified transaction amount and sales yield 
merchant count is the number of merchants active in our program 
qualified transaction amount represents the total dollar value of all member dining transactions that qualify for a benefit  and therefore provide revenue to us 
sales yield represents the percentage of the qualified transaction amount that we retain as revenue 
with regard to merchant count  total merchants as of december  were  as compared with  as of december   a decrease of 
the decrease in total merchant count was driven by a  or  decrease in marketing credits program merchants to  merchants  offset by a  or  increase in marketing services program merchants to  merchants 
the decrease in the number of marketing credits program merchants is due in part to the steps we have taken to remove undesirable and unprofitable merchants from our dining credits portfolio 
the decrease is also due in part to merchants that we otherwise desire to retain in our program that either will not agree to terms of a new deal that reflect our revised dining credits purchasing policies or no longer desire to participate in our program 
we continue to be focused more on the quality of the merchants in our portfolio and the profitability of our deals than on the total number of merchants in the program 
over time  we intend to grow the marketing credits program merchant count by demonstrating the value of our services  including timely business intelligence reports  customer rating data and marketing to members through various media including internet  email and print marketing 
we also intend to retain desirable merchants by increasing  on a risk adjusted basis  the amount of future member transactions that we purchase from them so that they remain in our program for a longer period of time 
we believe the increase in the number of marketing services program merchants is due to our improved value proposition to merchants  including timely business intelligence reports  customer rating data and marketing to 
table of contents members 
the marketing services program  while generating lower gross revenues  provides higher net revenues as a percentage of sales and does not put capital at risk 
qualified transaction amount at our participating merchants decreased  or  to  for compared with the decrease in qualified transaction amount of was less than the decrease of in our merchant count during the same period 
the percent decline in qualified transaction amount was less than the percent decline in merchant count because of an increase in available benefit opportunities for members 
by increasing available benefit opportunities  we are able to award loyalty rewards to members for more of their transactions at participating merchants and increase the qualified transaction amount at participating merchants 
we believe that merchants accept this increased availability in loyalty rewards because of our efforts to properly set their expectations regarding the amount of anticipated member activity when we enter into a deal with the merchant and because of the value of the marketing  business intelligence services and loyalty programs that we provide 
total sales yield decreased to for compared with for the decrease in overall sales yield was a result of a shift in mix between higher yield marketing credits program and lower yield marketing services program merchant count as well as a decrease in sales yield for both programs 
sales yield for the marketing credits program decreased from for to for sales yield for the marketing services program decreased from for to for the decrease in marketing services program sales yield between periods is due to lower pricing introduced during and the first quarter of the lower pricing from and has a continued effect through and beyond because agreements for our marketing services program renew annually on the same terms 
pricing changes take time to impact sales yield as evidenced by the decline in marketing services sales yield during we introduced higher prices in january of and started to see improvements in sales yield during the fourth quarter of sales for decreased when compared with primarily due to a decrease in marketing credits program sales and a shift in sales mix towards marketing services program merchants 
marketing credits program sales for decreased  or  when compared with despite the decrease of in the total number of marketing credits program merchants during the same period 
the relatively smaller decline in sales as compared to the decline in merchant count is a result of a higher average qualified transaction amount and increased reward opportunities at these merchants 
marketing services program sales for increased  or  when compared with the same period in the prior year 
the impact on sales caused by the increase in merchant count for the marketing services program was partially offset by the decrease in sales yield between periods 
cost of sales  which is composed of the cost of dining credits and related processing fees  remained unchanged at of sales for and cost of sales as a percentage of sales increased during the first half of  but was offset by the lower cost of sales of dining credits purchased under our revised purchasing policies during the third and fourth quarters of the provision for dining credits losses decreased to of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for compared with of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for at the end of each reporting period we estimate the allowance for doubtful dining credits accounts and  if necessary  adjust the allowance for losses 
the dining credits portfolio is aged based on sales for the preceding quarter and the allowance is determined primarily by applying estimated loss percentages to the aged portfolio 
allowances are also provided for specifically identified accounts and for dining credits balances that are large or slow moving 
the provision for losses also reflects the negative impact of merchant accounts that are written off and is positively impacted by the recoveries of amounts that have been previously written off 
the provision for losses for was significantly lower than prior year because of lower gross write offs  improved cash recoveries of past write offs and a lower overall reserve requirement due to a decrease in the dining credits portfolio between periods 
in addition  the provision for losses for the three months ended september  included  related to merchants impacted by hurricane katrina 
our revised dining credits purchasing policies have resulted in a decrease in the average amount of time it takes for members to use dining credits 
the estimated months to consume the dining credits portfolio has decreased from approximately months in the fourth quarter of to approximately months in the fourth quarter of in addition  we continue to improve our due diligence and risk assessment procedures in order to reduce the potential risk that members will not be able to use all of the dining credits that we purchase from a merchant 
these two factors have contributed to a decrease in the 
table of contents amount of dining credits that are written off as well as a lower reserve rate for the portfolio 
the ending allowance for dining credits losses as of december  was of the gross dining credits portfolio  as compared with as of december   which reflects lower risk in the dining credits portfolio due to our revised dining credits purchasing policies and improved due diligence and risk assessment procedures 
included in the allowance for dining credits losses for was recorded for the california litigation settlement  as discussed further in this section 
during the third quarter of  we believe that both the dining credits portfolio and its expected usage period reached a low point as evidenced by a higher loss reserve compared to the net write offs during the fourth quarter of in  the loss provision was of sales 
in  we intend to more effectively utilize our due diligence and risk assessment tools to increase the usage period for certain merchants based on a more balanced risk analysis and due diligence 
therefore  we believe that as the dining credits portfolio begins to grow  and the period for usage of dining credits lengthens slightly  the loss provision expense should more closely track net write offs in the portfolio and should increase toward more historically typical loss provision levels of approximately to of sales 
this increase in the loss provision expense could adversely affect our financial results when compared to the loss provision 
member benefits  which include partner commissions and incentive bonus awards paid to members  decreased slightly to of sales for compared with of sales for the same period in the prior year 
effective july   a variable loyalty rewards program was rolled out to substantially all of our loyalty partner program members in which some of our members loyalty rewards are tied to their level of participation in our programs 
the reduced loyalty rewards paid to less engaged members resulted in a lower overall effective rate of loyalty rewards earned by our total membership base during compared with this decrease was offset by two one time  special promotions held for members of certain partner programs during in which they received additional bonus miles for certain qualified transactions 
the improvement in the provision for losses and member benefits has resulted in an increase in net revenues for to  or of sales  from  or of sales  for membership and other income decreased or for compared with the decrease can be primarily attributed to the decline in membership fee income and a focus on marketing a no fee dining program to key program partners in which we enroll members at a reduced cost of solicitation and acquisition 
operating expenses salaries and benefits increased  or  to  for from  for due primarily to an increase in stock compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r and an increase in management incentive compensation expense 
in  we achieved the financial performance targets and of potential management incentive compensation was earned 
in  we did not achieve the financial performance targets required for the full payment of management incentive compensation and as a result only of the potential management incentive compensation was paid 
the sfas no 
r expense included restricted stock unit expense of  during included in this amount was approximately  relating to vested restricted stock units of our chief executive officer  ronald l 
blake  which were granted upon mr 
blake joining the company 
sales commissions and expenses decreased to of sales for compared with of sales for due to a decline in salary expense 
sales commissions and expenses decreased in dollar terms by  as a result of lower headcount and associated headcount costs  such as travel  training and commissions 
in connection with the company s development of a value based selling approach  significant training costs were incurred in during  this training program was refined and is now run by internal resources  resulting in a decrease in training expense between periods 
professional fees decreased  or  to  for compared with the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in outside collection fees and general corporate legal expenses 
in the past  legal expenses related to various litigation matters  including the california class action lawsuit  were reported in professional fees 
such 
table of contents expenses have been reclassified into litigation and related expenses on our statements of operations as described below 
member and merchant marketing expenses decreased  or  for compared with primarily due to a shift from print advertising to less costly electronic marketing 
during  certain territories that we reacquired in and experienced a significant decline in sales related to unanticipated competition and the loss of key salespersons in these territories which contributed to an operating loss for the quarter 
these financial results  coupled with several changes in senior sales management in the first quarter  gave rise to our need to evaluate the goodwill related to the reacquired franchises 
as a result of this evaluation  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment loss of  during the three months ended march  general and administrative expenses increased in compared with the increase was due to an increase in consulting and temporary help for information technologies  human resources and recruiting and a tax accrual relating to a sales tax audit in the state of hawaii  offset by lower severance expense 
throughout and  significant changes were made in senior management  contributing to severance expense totaling  and  in and  respectively 
during and  we recorded  and  respectively in litigation and related expenses relating to the california class action lawsuit and the source inc litigation as discussed in part  item  legal proceedings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
on december   we entered into an initial agreement with the representative plaintiffs to settle this litigation on behalf of a settlement class 
the initial settlement agreement was formalized into a final settlement agreement and was submitted to the united states district court for the central district of california for preliminary approval on march  we recorded  and  during and  respectively relating to the california class action suit 
we included future associated legal and administrative expenses related to the completion of the settlement of approximately  in the charge recorded during the balance of the accrual relating to this litigation as of december  was  and is expected to be paid through on april   we settled a patent litigation complaint against rewards network inc by source  inc 
we recorded  and during and  respectively relating to the source inc suit 
the balance of the accrual relating to this litigation as of december  was and is expected to be paid through other income and expense interest and other income increased  to  for compared with the increase is due to our increased cash and short term available for sale securities balances 
interest expense and financing costs related to our securitization facility  revolving credit facility and convertible subordinated debentures decreased  or  for compared with in july  we amended our revolving credit facility and as a result we amortized an additional of deferred financing costs during there was no such additional charge during income tax benefit provision our effective tax rate for was compared with for  due to an additional decrease of the weighted average effective state tax and true up of prior years taxes as a result of the new tax structure that was implemented in tax year the current tax benefit totaled  net loss net loss for was  compared with for the increase in net loss was due to the litigation and related expenses of  and  recorded in and  respectively  offset by a reduction in the provision for losses as a result of our more conservative dining credits purchasing policies and improved due diligence and risk assessment procedures

table of contents operating revenues the following table sets forth for the periods presented our sales  components of our costs of sales and certain other information for each of our two marketing programs 
marketing marketing marketing marketing credits services credits services program program total program program total number of qualified transactions average transaction amount qualified transaction amounts sales yield sales cost of dining credits processing fee total cost of sales provision for dining credits losses member benefits bonus rewards partner commissions total member benefits net revenue as more fully discussed below  sales for decreased when compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in the number of restaurants in our marketing credits program  a decrease in the number and amount of qualified transactions and a decrease in the sales yield recognized from qualified transactions 
while sales metrics for were  in general  lower as compared to  a number of changes in policy  procedure and selling approach were introduced during the second half of to address the decrease in overall sales metrics 
we introduced several initiatives aimed at improving the profitability of sales  including the revision of the sales compensation plan to be driven by restaurant deal profitability and the development of a consultative  value based selling approach for our sales force to use 
these changes were designed to lead to an increase in overall merchant count  an increase in qualified transaction amount  an increase in overall sales yield for our products  a decrease in cost of sales and a lower provision for losses 
total merchants as of december  were  as compared to  as of december   a decrease 
the decrease in total merchant count was driven by a  or  decrease in marketing credits program merchants which was partially offset by a  or  increase in marketing services program merchants 
the decrease in merchant count was attributed to our focus on entering in deals with increased profitability  as well as a decrease in sales force efficiency due to a less experienced sales force and the rollout of a new value based selling approach during the third and fourth quarters of qualified transaction amounts at our participating merchants decreased  or to  for as compared to  for the number of qualified transactions decreased to approximately  for as compared with  for and the average qualified transaction amount decreased to for from for the decrease in the number of qualified transactions was a result of fewer participating restaurants in the programs as well as our efforts to improve the management of members share of an individual restaurant s business 
we managed our members share of an individual restaurant s business  when appropriate  by qualifying transactions at that restaurant only on certain days of the week and or only for certain member groups and or by limiting the number of qualified transactions a member may have in a specific period 
this contributed to an 
table of contents decrease in the number of active member accounts to  at december  as compared with  at december  we believed that the lower average qualified transaction amount for compared with was due to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  i decreased sales in some large primary markets where the average transaction amounts tend to be higher  ii increased weekday revenues in which transaction amounts tend to be slightly lower  iii increased transactions among member groups with lower average dining transaction amounts and iv decreased transactions among member groups with higher average dining transaction amounts 
sales yield decreased to for compared with for the decrease in sales yield for the year was a result of the sale of marketing credits and marketing services products with lower sales yields during and the rollout of the value based selling approach in mid was intended to assist the sales force in securing new deals with higher sales yields going forward 
cost of sales increased to of sales for compared to of sales for many of the new products sold in the first half of had a lower sales yield and more favorable pricing of dining credits for our restaurants  resulting in a higher cost of sales for compared with the new value based selling approach implemented in mid was intended to assist the sales force in securing new deals with a lower cost of sales going forward 
also contributing to the increase in the cost of sales percentage was the decrease in sales under our marketing services program to of total sales for compared to of total sales for there effectively is no direct cost of sales associated with sales under our marketing services program and  therefore  the relative decrease in these sales as a percentage of total sales resulted in a higher total cost of sales percentage 
the provision for dining credits losses increased to of total sales and of marketing credits program sales for compared to of sales and of marketing credits program sales for at the end of each reporting period  we estimate the allowance for doubtful dining credits accounts and  if necessary  adjust the provision for losses 
the dining credits portfolio is aged based on sales for the preceding quarter and the allowance is determined primarily by applying estimated loss percentages to the aged portfolio 
allowances are also provided for specifically identified accounts and for dining credits balances that are large or slow moving 
the provision for losses for increased due to an increase in write offs 
the new deals entered into in and early generally allowed restaurants a larger dining credits purchase opportunity  which extended the period of time it took members to use the dining credits 
this increased credit risk in the dining credits portfolio 
also contributing to the higher level of expense for was an allowance of of our exposure for restaurants in the areas affected by hurricane katrina 
during the second half of  we implemented more conservative dining credits purchasing policies in an attempt to decrease the amount of time it takes members to use the dining credits we purchase 
in addition  we augmented our due diligence process and began developing and implementing new credit evaluation tools in an effort to better assess the financial risk of the proposed deals and the credit profile of our restaurants 
we revised and strengthened our approval processes and standards in an effort to further improve the profitability and reduce the potential risk of the deals that we enter into with our restaurants 
we believe we reduced our exposure to financial risk in our merchant portfolio  which over time reduced our provision for losses 
member benefits  which include partner commissions and incentive bonus rewards paid to members  decreased to of sales for compared to of sales for there were two primary reasons for the decrease in the rate of benefits during i in some cases  as part of the changes in restaurant deal economics  we reduced member benefit levels  and ii in the second quarter of  we introduced a program of variable benefits in which some of our members benefits are tied to their level of participation in our programs 
effective july   the variable benefits program was rolled out to substantially all of our loyalty partner program members 
the reduced member benefit levels and the reduced rate of benefits paid to less engaged members resulted in a lower overall effective rate of benefits earned by our total membership base in compared with membership and other income decreased or for compared with the decrease was primarily attributed to the decline in membership fee income and a focus on marketing a no fee dining program to key program partners where we enroll accounts at a reduced cost of acquisition and solicitation 

table of contents operating expenses salaries and benefits increased or to  for from  for due primarily to information technology personnel who were previously outsourced and who became employees in january and were included in salaries and benefits instead of operating expenses 
in addition  annual merit increases and higher employee benefit costs increased operating expenses 
however  the annual merit increases and higher employee benefit costs were substantially offset by a reduction of in management incentive compensation 
the lower management incentive compensation was due to the company s below expected performance in sales commissions and expenses increased to of sales for compared to of sales for in june  we made changes to our sales compensation plan that provided minimum incentive payments compensating our sales force based on the profitability of each restaurant deal 
minimum incentive payments began july and continued through november and totaled approximately  the expected reduction in sales commissions from a decrease in sales for compared to was more than offset by the increase in base salaries and the minimum incentive payments to our sales force 
in addition  sales training and related travel expenses were  for  compared with for during the second quarter of  the company hired an outside consulting firm to assist with the training of the sales force 
we believed that the investment made in the training of our sales force would result in increased sales productivity  higher deal profitability and improved restaurant retention 
professional fees decreased or to  for compared with mainly due to a decrease in accounting professional fees associated with the requirements under sarbanes oxley for the audit of internal control over financial reporting in compared to member and merchant marketing expenses decreased or for compared with primarily due to the elimination of our newsletter mailings and concentration on electronic marketing such as emails 
in addition  we eliminated our hotel and retail marketing efforts to focus on our dining business 
as previously discussed in this section  we recognized a non cash goodwill impairment loss of  during the first quarter of general and administrative expenses increased  or for compared with the increase was primarily the result of i increases in severance from  to  primarily due to the termination of some senior executives  including the chief executive officer  during  ii increases in rent and other office expenses by or to  and iii an increase in depreciation and amortization by or to  due to the design of a data warehouse as well as the purchase and or design of software primarily relating to the website maintenance and revision 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in i programming and systems by or to  due primarily to previously outsourced information technology personnel costs that were added to salaries and wages  and ii other expenses by or to  primarily due to an impairment of on an investment in a development stage entity during and a reduction in financial advisory fees 
as previously discussed in this section  we recorded  and  respectively in litigation and related expenses relating to the california class action lawsuit and the source inc litigation other income and expense interest and other income increased or to for compared with the increase was primarily due to our increased cash balance towards the end of resulting from the decline in the dining credits balance as well as improved interest rates earned on these investments 
interest expense and financing costs related to our securitization facility  revolving credit facility and convertible subordinated debentures increased or for compared to on november   we entered into a  unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na and lasalle bank  na in july  the facility was amended to  among other things  reduce the facility limit to  and modify the maturity date to june  emerging issues task force eitf no 
states that if the borrowing capacity of the new arrangement is less than the borrowing capacity of the old arrangement  then any fees paid to the 
table of contents creditor and any third party costs incurred should be associated with the new arrangement that is  deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement 
in addition  any unamortized deferred costs relating to the old arrangement at the time of the change should be written off in proportion to the decrease in borrowing capacity of the old arrangement 
the remaining unamortized deferred costs relating to the old arrangement should be deferred and amortized over the term of the new arrangement 
as a result of the amendment  the company amortized an additional of deferred financing costs relating to the old arrangement during also  financing costs associated with our securitization facility were fully amortized in may thereby partially offsetting the increase in expense 
income tax benefit provision our effective tax rate for was compared with for due to the decrease in the applicable federal rate and the weighted average effective state tax rate resulting from a shift in the apportionment factors among the states in which we conduct business 
the tax provision  which totaled as compared to taxable book income of was driven by i several unfavorable book versus tax differences  including severance expense  goodwill impairment and depreciation  that caused taxable income to be higher than book income and ii state tax planning strategy that  while effective in reducing our effective state tax rate  caused a one time expense charge for the write down of a deferred tax asset relating to dining credits allowances 
net loss income net loss for was compared with net income of  for this change was primarily due to the decline in sales  increase in the cost of dining credits  higher provision for losses  severance costs  a goodwill impairment charge  increased salaries and benefits  sales commissions  professional fees and higher rent and office expenses

applying the if converted method  as required by eitf  net income for the diluted earnings per share calculation is adjusted for interest expense associated with the convertible debt instrument and diluted weighted average shares outstanding are increased for shares issuable upon conversion 
we excluded  weighted average shares of common stock equivalents from our calculation of diluted weighted average shares outstanding as their effect would have been anti dilutive 
prior period diluted shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share amounts have been revised to present comparable information

dining credits dining credits funded gross dining credits less accounts payable dining credits was  at december   a decrease of  from december  we began to decrease the amount of dining credits purchased from each merchant in the second half of this decrease is due to more conservative dining credits purchase policies designed to increase profitability and decrease the risk that members will not be able to use all of the dining credits that we purchase from a merchant
