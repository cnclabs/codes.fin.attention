the and revenue related to our sexual dysfunction technology was due to receipt of an annual minimum license fee 
according to our agreement with our licensee  palatin technologies  inc palatin  if the agreement were to stay in place  the minimum fee is due until such time as the technology is commercialized  whereupon royalties will be due if higher than the minimum 
the increase in revenues in was due to a settlement with palatin related to certain fees received by palatin in pursuant to our license  we are entitled to a portion of fees palatin receives  which we believe have not been paid 
on september   we presented palatin with a notice of termination of the pt page technology license agreement stating that palatin committed a material breach of the agreement originally signed between the two companies on march  for further information  see item legal proceedings

risk factors the risk factors described below are not all inclusive 
all risk factors should be considered carefully when evaluating our business  results of operations  and financial position 
we undertake no obligation to update forward looking statements or risk factors 
there may be other risks and uncertainties not highlighted herein that may become material factors affecting our financial condition and business operations 
we derived more than of our retained royalties in fiscal from one technology 
we derived approximately  or  of retained royalties from our homocysteine assay technology 
in fiscal  we derived approximately of our retained royalties from this same technology 
our us patent for the homocysteine assay expired in july  and although we will not receive significant revenues from this technology after that date  we expect to receive revenue for sales made prior to that date 
in addition  we are in litigation with carolina liquid chemistries corporation to recover funds that we believe are due us for homocysteine assays kits manufactured  sold or offered for sale in infringement of our patent 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
a concentration of revenues makes our operations vulnerable to patent changes or expiration  especially the homocysteine assay  and could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position 
certain of our licensed patents have recently expired or will expire in the near future and we may not be able to replace their royalty revenues 
in  we earned retained royalties from licenses for patented technologies 
royalties from of those patented technologies have or will expire between and those patented technologies represented approximately of our retained royalties in retained royalties of approximately  or   or   or and  or  were from patents expiring in fiscal   and  respectively 
the loss of these royalties  especially from the homocysteine assay  will materially  adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to replace them with revenues from other licenses or other sources 
since it often takes two or more years for a technology to produce significant revenues  we must continuously seek new sources of future revenues 
in three of the last five fiscal years  we incurred significant net losses and negative cash flows  and our ability to finance future losses is limited  and may significantly affect existing stockholders 
the table below summarizes our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the five years ended july  net income loss      net cash flows from operating activities      investing activities      financing activities     net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents      page our current recurring revenue stream is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure 
in and  we were in part profitable because of unusually large  upfront license fees received related to our homocysteine technology that did not recur in or without these revenues  we would have incurred a loss in both years  and for each of the five years ended july  to return to and sustain profitability  we must increase recurring revenues by successfully licensing technologies with current and long term revenue streams  and continue to build our portfolio of innovative technologies 
over the last six months we significantly reduced overhead with reductions in staff across all functional departments of the company  reduced extraneous litigations  and obtained new technologies to build revenue 
we will continue to monitor our cost structure  and expect to operate within our generated revenue and cash balances 
our future royalty revenues  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting licenses  enforcing intellectual property rights  and profits or losses are subject to many factors outside our control  or that we cannot anticipate  including technological changes and developments  economic cycles  and the ability of our licensees to commercialize our technologies successfully 
consequently  we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to be profitable 
although we cannot be certain that we will be successful in these efforts  we believe that our capital resources will sustain us at least through fiscal we have no outstanding debt or available credit facility  and believe it would be very difficult to obtain debt financing due to the current composition of our balance sheet  and unpredictable nature of our annual cash flows 
our financing options are limited  and we must rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations  though this situation could change in the future 
we did obtain equity financing in that we completed in we continue to review financing options for our business  which may in the future include more equity financing 
if we enter into an equity financing arrangement in the future  and we sell shares of our common stock pursuant to such financing to raise cash to operate the business  existing holders of our common stock may suffer significant dilution to their equity position 
we depend on relationships with inventors to gain access to new technologies and inventions 
if we fail to maintain existing relationships or to develop new relationships  we may have fewer technologies and inventions available to generate revenues 
technology can change rapidly and industry standards continually evolve  often making products obsolete  or resulting in short product lifecycles 
our profitability depends on our licensees ability to adapt to such changes 
we do not invent new technologies or products 
we depend on relationships with universities  corporations  government agencies  research institutions  inventors  and others to provide technology based opportunities that we can develop into profitable royalty bearing licenses 
failure to maintain these relationships or to develop new relationships could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to forge new relationships or to maintain current relationships  we may be unable to identify new technology based opportunities and enter into royalty bearing licenses 
we also are dependent on our clients abilities to develop new technologies  introduce new products  and adapt to changes in technology and economic needs 
we cannot be certain that current or new relationships will provide the volume or quality of available new technologies necessary to sustain our business 
in some cases  universities and other sources of new technologies may compete against us as they seek to develop and commercialize these technologies themselves  or through entities that they develop  finance and or control 
in other cases  universities receive financing for basic research from companies in exchange for the exclusive right to commercialize any resulting inventions 
these and other strategies may reduce the number of technology sources  potential clients  to whom we can market our services 
if we are unable to secure new sources of technology  it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
page we receive most of our revenues from customers over whom we have no control 
we rely on royalties received from our customers for revenues 
the royalties we receive from customers depend on their efforts and expenditures over which we have no control 
additionally  customers development of new products involves great risk since many new technologies do not become commercially profitable products despite extensive development efforts 
our license agreements do not require customers to advise us of problems they may encounter in attempting to develop commercial products  and they usually treat such information as confidential 
we expect that our customers will encounter problems frequently 
our customers failure to resolve such problems may result in a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
strong competition within our industry may reduce our client base 
we compete with universities  law firms  venture capital firms and other technology commercialization firms for technology licensing opportunities 
many organizations offer some aspect of technology transfer services  and some are well established and have more financial and human resources than we do 
this market is highly fragmented and participants frequently focus on a specific technology area

our revenue growth depends on our ability to understand the technology requirements of our customers in the context of their markets 
if we fail to understand their technology needs or markets  we limit our ability to meet those needs and to generate revenues 
we believe that by focusing on the technology needs of our customers  we are better positioned to generate revenues by providing technology solutions to them 
the market demands of our customers drive our revenues 
the better we understand their markets and requirements  the better we are able to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for our customers 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to understand our customers technical  commercial  and market requirements and constraints  and to identify and obtain effective technology solutions for them 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends on the knowledge  efforts and abilities of a small number of key personnel 
john b 
nano is our chairman  president  chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer and aris d 
despo is our executive vice president  business development 
we rely on our professional staff and contract business development consultants to identify intellectual property opportunities and technology solutions  and to negotiate and close license agreements 
competition for personnel with the necessary range and depth of experience is intense 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel 
if we are unable to hire and retain highly qualified professionals and consultants  especially with our small number of staff  our revenues  prospects  financial condition and future activities could be materially adversely affected 
our customers  and we  depend on government approvals to commercially develop certain licensed products 
commercial development of some licensed patents may require the approval of governmental regulatory agencies  especially in the life sciences area  and there is no assurance that those agencies will grant such approvals 
in the united states  the principal governmental agency involved is the us food and drug administration fda 
the fda s approval process is rigorous  time consuming and costly 
unless and until a licensee obtains approval for a product requiring such approval  the licensee may not sell the product in the us  and therefore we will not receive royalty income based on us sales of the product 
page if our clients and we are unable to protect the intellectual property underlying our licenses  or to enforce our patents adequately  we may be unable to develop such licensed patents or technologies successfully 
our success in earning revenues from licenses is subject to the risk that issued patents may be declared invalid  that a patent may not be issued on a patent application  or that competitors may circumvent or infringe our licensed patents and thereby render our licensed patents not commercially viable 
in addition  when all patents underlying a license expire  our royalties from that license cease  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to replace those royalties with royalty revenues from new or other licenses 
patent litigation has increased  it can be expensive and may delay or prevent our customers products from entering the market 
our clients and or we may pursue patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings against sellers of products that we believe infringe our patent rights 
holders of conflicting patents or sellers of competing products also may challenge our patents in patent infringement litigation or interference proceedings 
for a description of proceedings in which we are currently involved  see item legal proceedings 
we cannot be certain that our clients and or we will be successful in any such litigation or proceeding  and the results and costs may materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
developing new products  creating effective commercialization strategies for technologies  and enhancing those products and strategies are subject to inherent risks 
risks include unanticipated delays  unrecoverable expenses  technical problems or difficulties  and the possibility that development funds will be insufficient 
the occurrence of any one or more of these risks could cause us to abandon or substantially change our technology commercialization strategy 
our success depends on  among other factors  our clients developing new or improved technologies  our customers products meeting targeted cost and performance objectives for large scale production  and our customers ability to adapt technologies to satisfy industry standards  and consumer expectations and needs  and bringing their products to market before market saturation 
they may encounter unanticipated problems that result in increased costs or substantial delays in introducing and marketing new products 
products may not be reliable or durable under actual operating conditions or commercially viable and competitive 
new products may not meet price or other performance objectives when introduced in the marketplace 
any of these events would adversely affect our realization of royalties from new products 
we have not paid dividends on our common stock 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since  and  our board of directors does not currently have plans to declare or pay cash dividends in the future 
the decision to pay dividends is solely at the discretion of our board of directors based upon factors that they deem relevant  and may change at any time 
as a publicly held company  we have significantly higher administrative costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as new rules implemented by the sec and new listing requirements adopted by the american stock exchange in response to the sarbanes oxley act of  has required changes in corporate governance practices  internal control policies and audit committee practices of public companies 
these new rules  regulations  and requirements have increased our legal  audit  financial  compliance and administrative costs  and have made certain other activities more time consuming and costly 
the additional costs are expected to continue 
these new rules and regulations page may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance in the future  and could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members for our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
in developing new products we are affected by patent laws and regulations 
patent laws and regulations are constantly being reviewed for possible revision 
we cannot be certain how we will be affected by revisions

the parties have filed their complaints  counterclaims  and answers  and discovery is currently underway 
ctt commenced an arbitration proceeding on june   as a result of palatin s breach of a license agreement between ctt and palatin dated march  the three member panel of arbitrators has been selected  and a formal hearing was to have been held in beginning of november the hearing date has been extended to march the panel has agreed to allow both sides to file dispositive motions to summarily resolve certain claims on september   we presented palatin with a notice of termination of the pt technology license agreement stating that palatin committed a material breach of the agreement originally signed between the two companies on march  ben marcovitch and other co defendants on august  we announced that former ctt director ben marcovitch had been removed for cause from our board of directors by unanimous vote of ctt s five directors for violating ctt s code of conduct 
at that time  ctt also withdrew from its involvement with agrofrut  eu  a page nutraceutical firm brought to ctt by mr 
marcovitch 
as announced on april   ctt had paid  to agrofrut for a ownership  and certain marketing and investment options in agrofrut 
on august   we retained greenberg traurig  llp  an international law firm  to recover the funds from agrofrut  and juan carlos esguerra of the bogota  colombia based law firm  esguerra  barrera  arriaga  to handle ctt s affairs in colombia 
ctt s advisors assembled the following information  which we included in our subsequent federal complaint described below 
breen associates  an independent investigative firm  developed evidence that showed that mr 
marcovitch and agrofrut provided ctt s board of directors with false and misleading information 
included in those findings was the fact that papers submitted by mr 
marcovitch and agrofrut prior to the march  ctt board meeting listed dr 
raul aragon davalos as an executive and chief scientist of agrofrut  and the inventor of agrofrut s new technology to remove complex compounds such as bromelain and xylitol  at better than purity  from pineapples and other organic waste 
dr 
raul aragon davalos had actually been killed in a drive by shooting in cali  colombia on february  dr 
raul aragon davalos s assassination was known to mr 
marcovitch and betty rios valencia  president and ceo of agrofrut and former spouse of mr 
marcovitch  as well as to other executives of agrofrut  but was never revealed to ctt by them 
mr 
marcovitch had admitted to a ctt outside counsel  and to a ctt shareholder  that he had attended dr 
raul aragon davalos s funeral 
further  the investigations have shown that dr 
raul aragon davalos was a convicted drug trafficker and that ms 
rios valencia also has a drug conviction record 
among other things  the involvement of mr 
marcovitch  ms 
rios valencia and john derek elwin  iii  a former ctt employee  with convicted drug traffickers resulted in ctt s decisive actions against these individuals 
on august  we filed a federal complaint in the us district court for the district of connecticut against mr 
marcovitch and other co defendants 
the complaint claims that false and misleading information had been provided to ctt in a conspiracy to fraudulently obtain funds from ctt using the agrofrut transaction 
others named in the suit are ms 
rios valencia  mr 
elwin  iii  and agrofrut  eu in our lawsuit  we requested  among other relief  punitive damages and attorneys fees 
based upon our understanding of the facts and issues  we have presented our findings in our federal complaint in a manner that will allow shareholders to understand the gravity of the charges 
it is our opinion and that of our board of directors that this lawsuit is required to recover our  and to settle outstanding issues regarding the named parties 
the recent in depth due diligence and subsequent investigation by breen associates  conducted prior to mr 
marcovitch s removal from the board  disclosed several issues of credibility and raised serious concerns regarding the defendants named in the lawsuit 
on october  at a show cause hearing  the court stated that all defendants named in the case  and their associates  were enjoined from any further use of any remaining part of the  received from ctt 
a full disclosure of all accounts where remaining funds are held  and a complete description of the disposition of any portion of the ctt payment must be made to ctt s counsel by november  the court adjourned the hearing on our application for prejudgment remedy until december  we intend to aggressively pursue this matter

the case alleged  in part  breach of contract and homocysteine assay patent infringement  and that labcorp owed the plaintiffs royalties for homocysteine assays performed beginning in the summer of using methods falling within the claims of a patent we own 
we licensed the patent on a non exclusive basis to mli and mli sublicensed it to labcorp 
in november a jury confirmed the validity of our patent rights  found that labcorp had willfully infringed our patent and breached their sublicense contract  and awarded damages to the plaintiffs 
in an amended judgment issued in november  the court awarded ctt approximately  in damages   in enhanced  punitive  damages   in attorneys fees  and  in prejudgment interest  and had issued a permanent injunction barring labcorp from performing future homocysteine assays

overview we are a full service technology transfer and licensing provider 
we provide technology transfer  selling and licensing services focused on the technology needs of our customers  matching those requirements with commercially viable technology solutions  bridging the gap between market demand and innovation 
we develop relationships with universities  companies  inventors and patent or intellectual property holders to obtain the rights or a license to their intellectual property rights  principally patents and inventions collectively  the technology or technologies 
they become our clients  for whom we find markets to sell or further develop their technology 
we also develop relationships with those who have a need or use for technologies 
they become our customers  usually through a license or sublicense 
we identify and commercialize innovative technologies in life and physical sciences  electronics  and nano science developed by universities  companies and inventors 
our goal is to maximize the value of intellectual assets for the benefit of our clients  customers and shareholders 
we earn revenues primarily from licensing our clients and our own technologies to our customers licensees 
our customers pay us royalties based on usage of the technology  and we share those royalties with our clients 
in the normal course of business  our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter  and year to year  due to changes in revenues of our customers  upfront license fees  new licenses granted  expiration of existing licenses  and or the expiration or economic obsolescence of patents underlying licenses 
reliance on one revenue source 
for the three years ended july   we had a significant concentration of revenues from our homocysteine assay technology 
the patent for this technology expired in july we expect to receive revenues for any homocysteine assays conducted prior to the expiration date  but we will not receive revenues from this technology for sales made after that date 
revenues from our homocysteine assay technology decreased compared to due to upfront license fees received in that did not occur in the current year  and a decrease in the number of reported tests performed by two of our licensees 
in  we received over million in upfront fees from new homocysteine licenses granted in that year 
we believe that we had licenses with the premier distributors and laboratories in the united states that sell and or perform tests used to measure homocysteine levels 
we perform audits of our licensees to insure that we capture all available revenues 
we believe that part of the decrease in the number of tests reported may be due to suspected infringers who are selling homocysteine tests without a license 
we filed a patent infringement complaint against three suspected infringers  but we believe progress in this case may be subject to delaying tactics by the defendants  as well as the normal extended period of time it takes for such cases to work their way through the court system 
in addition  in response to the patent enforcement action we filed  one of the defendants has requested that the united states patent and trademark office uspto re evaluate the validity of our patent 
while we do not expect page an adverse finding by the uspto  such actions could further delay the ultimate resolution of the case  and negatively impact our reported financial results through decreased revenues and increased legal costs

presentation all amounts in this item have been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars 
in addition  all periods discussed in this item relate to our fiscal year ending july  first  second  third and fourth quarters ending october  january  april and july  respectively 
the following discussion and analysis provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
results of operations vs 
summary of results we incurred a net loss for of  or per share  compared to a net loss for of  or per diluted share  an increased loss of  or 
per share 
the reasons for the increase in net loss are explained in detail below 
our current revenue stream is insufficient for us to be profitable with our present cost structure 
we have plans in place to increase revenues and we expect to be profitable on a long term basis 
revenues total revenues for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
retained royalties for were  which was  or lower than the  reported in the following compares revenues from technologies with retained royalties greater than or equal to  in or increase increase decrease decrease homocysteine assay    ethyol tm    gallium arsenide    wireless fm modulator    plasma display   all other technologies total retained royalties   during and  we received and  respectively  of upfront fees from new homocysteine licenses granted in the year 
while the receipt of upfront licensee fees is common  the magnitude of such fees fluctuates  sometimes significantly from period to period 
without upfront license fees  revenues from this technology were  and  for and  respectively  a  decrease from this decrease is due principally to fewer tests performed by two of our larger licensees 
in addition  we believe that infringers have negatively impacted the amount of revenues we are receiving relating to our homocysteine technology 
our us patent that covers this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expired in july we expect to receive revenues for any homocysteine assays conducted prior to the expiration date  but we will not receive revenues from this technology for sales made after that date 
page approximately of our retained royalties for were from our homocysteine assays technology 
we continue to seek revenue from new technology licenses to mitigate the concentration of revenues  and replace revenue from expiring licenses 
in  royalties from ethyol sales were limited to a maximum of  per calendar year 
during fiscal this agreement reached its tenth anniversary 
as a result  royalties will be earned in any of the five years following the anniversary to the extent that ethyol sales exceed the revenue generated in the anniversary year 
we expect to earn minimal royalties on this technology going forward 
this patent expires in december us patents for gallium arsenide were issued from march to may this technology was licensed to several foreign and one us licensee 
patents expired from may through september after september  we do not expect significant future revenues for this technology 
the decrease in gallium arsenide revenues in was due to the expiration of the last of the patents 
investment income includes dividends and interest earned on our invested cash 
investment income for was  compared to  in a decrease of  or  compared to the decrease is due to lower average monthly cash balances in the current year compared to the prior year  offset by significantly higher rates of return earned on the invested cash 
other income for is primarily the proceeds of  on the sale of patents related to our video compression technology during the fourth quarter 
other income also includes sales of product and a marketing study 
expenses increase increase decrease decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues    general and administrative expenses    patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements    loss on investment total expenses    total expenses increased  in compared to a major part of the expenditures in was costs associated with the prior board and management s annual meeting and proxy contest of about million  amounts accrued to settle mr 
nano s suit of million for million and related legal costs of million  and the loss on the agrofrut investment of  as well as an increase of  in compensation expense related to change of control stock options 
personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues increased a net  in  compared to  due to a combination of several factors 
the increase in was due to  of severance costs accrued for aris d 
despo and paul a 
levitsky see item legal proceedings  and the addition of six new staff members early in the year 
we have restructured our organization to lower overhead costs by cutting our senior level staff from to also includes non cash compensation expense related to stock options of  for the acceleration of vesting of the options that were outstanding on february  due to the change in control provisions of the employees stock option plan activated by the removal of the prior board  and  for the grant of  options to purchase common stock granted during the third quarter of fiscal with of such options vesting immediately and therefore required to be expensed 
page general and administrative expenses increased a net  in  compared to  principally due to corporate litigation  annual meetings and proxy contest costs as discussed above 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  increased a net  in  compared to  as we incurred substantial costs to defend our homocysteine and fujitsu patent infringement lawsuits 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
loss on investment 
in april  we invested  in a non public company located in cali  colombia for a ownership  including proprietary technology for converting biomass waste to nutraceutical ingredients  b an option to purchase the remaining ownership and c an exclusive marketing agreement 
during the fourth quarter  it was determined that the technology was not viable and that we had been defrauded 
as a result  the entire investment of  was written off 
we have brought a lawsuit against the non public company  a former ctt director  his former spouse and a former ctt employee to attempt to recover our investment 
for further information  see item legal proceedings 
provision for income taxes in current and prior years  we generated significant federal and state income and alternative minimum tax amt losses  and these net operating losses nols were carried forward for income tax purposes to be used against future taxable income 
in and in  we incurred a loss but did not record a benefit since the benefit was fully reserved see below 
however  we did record a  benefit due to a change in estimate of fiscal year federal amt liability 
in addition  we determined that we met certain conditions that made us eligible for a  refund of the amt paid in  which we received subsequent to as a result  in we recorded in total a benefit for income taxes of  we will be subject to the full amt in future years 
the nols are an asset to us if we can use them to offset or reduce future taxable income and therefore reduce the amount of both federal and state income taxes to be paid in future years 
previously  since we were incurring losses and could not be sure that we would have future taxable income to be able to use the benefit of our nols  we recorded a valuation allowance against the asset  reducing its book value to zero 
in and in  the benefit from our net loss was offset completely by a valuation allowance recorded against the asset 
we did not show a benefit for income taxes  other than the benefit described above 
we will reverse the valuation allowance if we have future taxable income 
we have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in addition  we can use our nols to reduce our future amt liability 
a significant portion of the remaining nols at july   approximately  was derived from income tax deductions related to the stock options exercises 
the tax effect of these deductions will be credited against capital in excess of par value at the time they are utilized for book purposes  and not credited to income 
we will never receive a benefit for these nols in our statement of operations 
results of operations vs 
summary of results we incurred a net loss for of  or per share  compared to net income for of  or per diluted share  a decrease of  or per diluted share 
the decrease in net income is explained below 
revenues total revenues for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  or 
in  we received unusually high revenues from upfront license fees related to our homocysteine technology  and legal awards and dividends  which did not recur in page retained royalties for were  which was  or lower than the  reported in the following table compares revenues from technologies with retained royalties greater than or equal to  in or increase increase decrease decrease homocysteine assay    ethyol    gallium arsenide    plasma display   sexual dysfunction    all other technologies    total retained royalties    approximately of our retained royalties for were from four technologies from homocysteine assays  from ethyol  from gallium arsenide patents  and from plasma display 
during and  we received  and  respectively  of upfront fees from new homocysteine licenses granted in the year 
while the receipt of upfront licensee fees is common  the magnitude of such fees fluctuates  sometimes significantly from period to period 
without upfront license fees  revenues from this technology were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase in was due to a combination of new licenses granted and the inclusion of a full year of revenues from several licenses granted during the prior year  partially offset by a decrease in tests performed by one of our larger licensees 
our patent for this homocysteine assay  the validity of which has been confirmed by a court decision  expired in july royalties from ethyol sales were limited to a maximum of  per calendar year  and we have received this amount every calendar year since differences from year to year are due to timing of receipts 
us patents for gallium arsenide were issued from march to may this technology was licensed to several foreign and one us licensee 
patents expired in may through september after september  we do not expect significant future revenues for this technology 
the decrease in gallium arsenide revenues in was due to the receipt in of a one time settlement of back royalties from one customer as a result of a royalty audit and subsequent litigation relating to an expired license 
our share of the settlement was  net of fees paid to a royalty auditing firm 
approximately  and  of royalties earned in and  respectively  were from foreign licenses 
the decrease in revenues in compared to related to our sexual dysfunction technology was due to a settlement received from palatin technologies  inc palatin on june   related to a fee received by palatin in august the settlement was the result of a mediation of a prior dispute whereby we had demanded arbitration  which is the sole method of dispute resolution pursuant to the license between us and palatin  due to our belief that palatin was in material breach of the license for not paying us a percentage of the subcontract fee they received  as provided for in the license 
pursuant to the settlement  palatin made a cash payment to us  our share of which was  and further agreed to issue to us promptly  shares of its unrestricted common stock  bringing the total in for the settlement to  for further information  see item legal proceedings 
royalty legal awards of  in were from two awards we received related to litigation against laboratory corporation of america holdings d b a labcorp labcorp  including  from the original november decision in this homocysteine patent infringement case  that page labcorp had appealed unsuccessfully  and  for attorneys fees and court costs also awarded to us in the original case 
there were no legal awards in for further information  see item legal proceedings 
dividends received of  for were from our receipt of three separate dividends from melanotan corporation  in which we own approximately of the common stock 
these dividends are described in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item no dividends were received in investment income for was  compared to  in included in were  of interest from the labcorp awards  and  of interest earned on an outstanding note receivable that was fully repaid in without these items  investment income for increased  or  compared to the increase is due to a combination of significantly higher rates of return on invested cash and higher average monthly cash balances in the current year compared to the prior year 
increase increase expenses decrease decrease personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues    general and administrative expenses    patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements    total expenses personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased a net  in  compared to  due to a combination of several factors 
personnel expenses decreased a net  in  compared to the prior year 
this was due to a  decrease in commission and bonus expense  as a result of the decrease in our financial results  partially offset by an increase aggregating to  in other personnel costs for recruiting expenses incurred to add business development and business development support employees  and for severance costs  and a net  increase for non cash compensation charges related to stock options 
the non cash stock option compensation expense of  was the result of our adoption of a new accounting pronouncement in that required us to recognize expense for stock options vesting during the year 
this expense will continue in future years 
previously we did not have to recognize any expense except if a prior grant was modified 
the non cash stock option compensation expense of  recognized in was related to modifications of stock options previously granted to a former employee 
other direct expenses relating to revenues decreased  principally as a result of less costs incurred in  compared to the prior year  for our review of the feasibility of certain technologies 
general and administrative expenses decreased a net  in  compared to  due to a combination of several factors 
legal and other defense costs related to a whistleblower claim filed against us by a former employee decreased  from the prior year 
general corporate legal expense decreased  compared to the prior year due to less activity 
investor relations and marketing expenses decreased  in addition  there was a  decrease in costs incurred in compared to the prior year to comply with internal control documentation  testing and audit requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
was our first year under the sox requirements  and costs were high as a result of initial implementation costs  including the creation of original documentation  management testing and external auditing of management s testing results 
in  we only had to update the documentation 
in addition  as a result of new regulations issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  we were not required to have our independent auditors test our assertions about the effectiveness of our internal controls in this reduced our current year costs since we did not have to accrue external audit fees for this purpose 
page since we have decided that we will maintain our internal control documentation and testing  we will have ongoing compliance costs 
partially offsetting these decreases  other legal expenses increased  in  compared to  related to our defense of two complaints filed against ctt by a former president and ceo  and the complaint we filed against him see item legal proceedings 
legal expenses also increased because we recorded a  credit in to expense a reimbursement from our directors and officers liability insurance carrier for legal costs incurred and expensed in prior years related to an sec investigation and subsequent civil suit 
there was no such credit in directors fees and expenses increased an aggregate of  principally as a result of an increase in the coverage levels of our directors and officers liability insurance  and a net increase in non cash stock option compensation expense 
in  we recognized non cash expense for stock options granted to directors pursuant to the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement 
previously  we did not recognize expense related to stock options issued to directors  except that in we recognized expense relating to a modification of previously issued stock options 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  increased a net  in  compared to  as we incurred substantial costs to defend our homocysteine patent from an appeal to the us supreme court by labcorp of an earlier decision in our favor 
the appeal was unsuccessful 
the level of patent enforcement expenses relates to our legal strategies and varies depending on the stage and activity  if any  relating to each litigation provision for income taxes in current and prior years  we generated significant federal and state income and alternative minimum tax amt losses  and these net operating losses nols were carried forward for income tax purposes to be used against future taxable income 
in  we utilized a portion of our nol carry forwards against our regular federal and state taxable income  effectively eliminating our regular income tax liabilities 
however  in we expected to be subject to the amt liability  where we are limited to using of our nol carry forwards against taxable income 
our provision for income taxes of  principally was for our estimated net amt liability 
in  we incurred a loss but did not record a benefit since the benefit was fully reserved see below 
however  we did record a  benefit due to a change in estimate of fiscal year federal amt liability 
in addition  we determined that we met certain conditions that made us eligible for a  refund of the amt paid in  which we received subsequent to as a result  in we recorded in total a benefit for income taxes of  we will be subject to the full amt in future years 
the nols are an asset to us if we can use them to offset or reduce future taxable income and therefore reduce the amount of both federal and state income taxes to be paid in future years 
previously  since we were incurring losses and could not be sure that we would have future taxable income to be able to use the benefit of our nols  we recorded a valuation allowance against the asset  reducing its book value to zero 
in  the benefit from our net loss was offset completely by a valuation allowance recorded against the asset 
we did not show a benefit for income taxes  other than the benefit described above 
we will reverse the valuation allowance if we have future taxable income 
we have substantial federal and state operating and capital loss carryforwards to use against future regular taxable income 
in addition  we can use our nols to reduce our future amt liability 
a significant portion of the remaining nols at july   approximately  was derived from income tax deductions related to the stock options exercises 
the tax effect of these deductions will be credited against capital in excess of par value at the time they are utilized for book purposes  and not credited to income 
we will never receive a benefit for these nols in our statement of operations 
page financial condition and liquidity our liquidity requirements arise principally from our working capital needs  including funds needed to find and obtain new technologies and to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights  if necessary 
we fund our liquidity requirements with a combination of cash on hand and cash flows from operations  if any  including royalty legal awards 
at july   we had no outstanding debt or available credit facility  and we believe that it would be very difficult for ctt to obtain any form of debt financing due to the current composition of our balance sheet  including a lack of hard assets against which to borrow  and the unpredictable nature of our annual cash flows 
our financing options currently are limited 
we must rely on cash on hand and cash flows from operations  if any  though this situation could change in the future 
we did obtain equity financing in that we completed in we continue to review financing options for our business  which may in the future include more equity financing 
we believe we will be successful in increasing recurring revenues in fiscal by licensing new technologies to customers and collecting due  but unpaid  royalties on existing licenses  to more than offset our operating costs and produce a profit for fiscal to date  such revenue and achievement of profitability has not yet occurred 
however  if necessary  we will meet anticipated operating cash requirements by further reducing costs  and or monetizing assets 
we believe that the combination of our cash on hand and existing revenue flow will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated operating cash requirements through fiscal cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and interest earning investments with maturities of three months or less  including overnight bank deposits and money market funds 
we carry cash equivalents at cost 
during the year ended july   we completed our equity financing see below  which provided a significant amount of cash during the year 
since that financing has been completed  we will be limited in to financing our liquidity needs solely from cash on hand  and cash flow from operations  if any 
at july   cash and cash equivalents were  compared to  at july  cash used in operating activities in was  compared to  in the decrease in cash provided by operations in the current year principally was the result of the increased net loss incurred in  offset by a decrease in receivable as a result of collection of the payment from lab corp in january cash used in investing activities was  compared to  in the prior year 
the increase in the current year is primarily related to the investment in agrofrut  eu during the third quarter of see item legal proceedings  as well as the purchase of furniture and fixtures for ctt s new offices  which the prior management moved into in august net cash provided by financing activities was  in  compared to  in the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in compared to  was due to cash received in as the result of the sale of common stock pursuant to an equity financing arrangement 
this arrangement was completed in in addition to fluctuations in the amounts of retained royalties revenues reported  changes in royalties receivable and payable reflect our normal cycle of royalty collections and payments 
funding and capital requirements equity financing in february  we entered into an agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc fusion capital to sell them up to million of our common stock over a twenty month period from the commencement date of may  the stock sale agreement 
we exercised our right to extend the term of the stock sale agreement by six months 
we also had the right to determine the timing and amount of stock sold  if any  to fusion capital 
in june  the stock sale agreement terminated upon reaching the million threshold of common stock sold to fusion capital 
page pursuant to the stock sale agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to fusion capital at inception the initial shares  and issued them  additional commitment shares on a pro rata basis as we sold the million of stock collectively  the commitment shares 
cash received and common stock sold and issued pursuant to the stock sale agreement were as follows commitment cash shares shares total received sold issued shares year ended july      year ended july      year ended july      total     we did not exercise the option to enter into a second million stock sale agreement with fusion capital 
income taxes we currently have the benefit of using a portion of our accumulated nols to eliminate any future regular federal and state income tax liabilities 
we will continue to receive this benefit until we have utilized all of our nols federal and state 
however  we cannot determine when and if we will be profitable and utilize the benefit of the remaining nols before they expire 
capital requirements our plan is to increase annual recurring revenues  achieve profitability and increase shareholder value 
to accomplish our goals  we have increased our global marketing capabilities  searching for new sources of technologies  licensing those technologies  and establishing strategic relationships 
in august the prior management moved to a new office 
the new office space has a seven year lease agreement through august since the new space is larger than the prior space  our annual rent expense will be   more than we incurred in we are attempting to find a sub tenant to offset some of the obligations under the lease 
the increase in equipment and furnishings in was due to the purchase of furniture for ctt s new office space 
general the amounts and timing of our future cash requirements depends on many factors  including results of our operations and marketing efforts  results and costs of our legal proceedings  and our equity financing 
to achieve and sustain profitability  we must license technologies with sufficient current and long term revenue streams  and continually add new licenses 
however  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting rights to licensees  enforcing intellectual property rights  and collecting royalty revenues are subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control and or that we cannot currently anticipate 
although there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts  we believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our current and anticipated operating cash requirements for at least the next year 
page contractual obligations and contingencies at july   our contractual obligations were contractual within more than obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations  principally rent      nano employment agreement    any other commitments we may have are contingent upon a future event 
contingencies 
our directors  officers  employees and agents may claim indemnification in certain circumstances 
we are currently exposed to potential indemnification claims by a former executive in connection with a civil suit filed by the sec see item legal proceedings 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance  subject to deductibles 
we also carry liability insurance  casualty insurance  for owned or leased tangible assets  and other insurance as needed to cover us against potential and actual claims and lawsuits that occur in the ordinary course of business 
many of our license and service agreements provide that upfront license fees  license fees and or royalties we receive are applied against amounts that our clients or we have incurred for patent application  prosecution  issuance and maintenance costs 
if we incur such costs  we expense them as incurred  and reduce our expense if we are reimbursed from future fees and or royalties we receive 
if the reimbursement belongs to our client  we record no revenue or expense 
as of july   ctt and its majority owned subsidiary  vector vision  inc vvi  have remaining obligations  contingent upon receipt of certain revenues  to repay up to  and  respectively  in consideration of grant funding received in and ctt also is obligated to pay at the rate of of its revenues  if any  from transferring rights to certain inventions supported by the grant funds 
vvi is obligated to pay at rates of of its net sales of supported products or of its revenues from licensing supported products  if any 
we recognize these obligations only if we receive revenues related to the grant funds 
we recognized approximately  of these obligations in currently  we engage independent consultants who provide us with business development  consulting and or evaluation services under contracts that are cancelable on certain written notice 
these contracts include contingencies for potential incentive compensation earned solely on sales resulting directly from the work of the consultant 
we have neither accrued nor paid significant incentive compensation under such contracts 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires that we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on page information available at the time  and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
by their nature  estimates  assumptions and judgments are subject to change at any time  and may depend on factors we cannot control 
as a result  if future events differ from our estimates  assumptions and judgments  we may need to adjust or revise them in later periods 
we believe the following significant estimates  assumptions and judgments we used in preparing our consolidated financial statements are critical to understanding our financial condition and operations 
upfront license fees received 
upfront license fees received in and from new licenses were recorded in retained royalties in accordance with our revenue recognition policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation on a fair value basis 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including  estimating the expected life of the stock option  volatility  and the amount of stock based awards that can be expected to be forfeited 
our estimates were based on our historical experience with stock option awards 
equity securities 
we believe that unrealized changes in the value of our equity securities are temporary and therefore we have not recognized any gains or losses in earnings 
if we determine that the changes in value are not temporary  we will recognize gains or losses at that time 
related party transactions our board of directors determined that when a director s services are outside the normal duties of a director  we compensate the director at the rate of  per day  plus expenses  which is the same amount we pay a director for attending a one day board meeting 
we classify these amounts as consulting expenses  included in personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenues 
we incurred charges for consulting services  including expenses and use taxes  provided by one former director of   and  in  and  respectively 
we also incurred a charge of  in  for consulting services provided by a relative of our current president and ceo  and of  in for consulting services provided by a relative of a former president and ceo

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have significant market risk to the valuation of our assets other than risks related to our equity security holdings of palatin and clinuvel 
the value of both the palatin and clinuvel stock is included in current assets as available for sale securities 
the value of both assets is subject to market fluctuations in the per share price of the stock as well as foreign currency fluctuations of the australian stock exchange traded clinuvel shares 
we currently consider unrealized fluctuations in the fair value of both the palatin and clinuval shares to be temporary  and therefore have recorded changes in the fair values as part of other comprehensive income loss  which is included as a component of equity 
during the year ended july   the following changes in fair value occurred with respect to the palatin and clinuvel shares palatin clinuvel total unrealized increase decrease in market price of securities held    unrealized translation adjustments on securities held   other comprehensive income loss    page
