item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a worldwide leader in the design  development  manufacture and support of high performance process control metrology  defect inspection  and data analysis systems used by semiconductor device manufacturers 
we provide yield management solutions used in both wafer processing and final manufacturing through a family of standalone systems and integrated modules for both transparent and opaque thin film measurements and macro defect inspection 
all of these systems feature production worthy automation and are backed by worldwide customer support 
on february   the merger with august technology was completed 
the combined company will continue to be known as rudolph technologies  inc under the terms of the agreement  we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to former august technology shareholders 
the results of operations of august technology have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the merger 
due to the size of august technology and the effects of purchase accounting  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows may not be comparable to prior periods 
the effects of purchase accounting were completed in with the exception of income taxes 
august technology was a world class provider of automated defect detection and product characterization systems for microelectronic device manufacturers 
their systems provided manufacturers with information that enables process enhancing decisions  to ultimately lower manufacturing costs and decrease time to market 
they had traditionally provided systems to address the automated inspection needs of the early stages of the final manufacturing or back end of the microelectronic device manufacturing process 
in addition  they had introduced new products for edge and backside inspection systems for advanced macro defect detection primarily in the front end of the wafer manufacturing process 
when used in conjunction with one another these systems allow a manufacturer to inspect the top  edge and back of a wafer s surface 
rudolph s business is affected by the annual spending patterns of our customers on semiconductor capital equipment 
the amount that our customers devote to capital equipment spending depends on a number of factors  including general worldwide economic conditions as well as other economic drivers such as personal computer and cell phone sales 
current forecasts by industry analysts for the semiconductor device manufacturing industry project a year over year increase in capital spending of for we monitor capital equipment spending through announced capital spending plans by our customers and monthly published industry data such as the book to bill ratio 
the book to bill ratio is a month running statistic that compares bookings or orders placed with capital equipment suppliers to billings or shipments 
a book to bill above one shows that semiconductor device equipment manufacturers are ordering equipment at a pace that exceeds the equipment suppliers shipments for the period 
the three month rolling average north american semiconductor equipment book to bill ratio was for the month of december  increasing from the september book to bill ratio of 
the book to bill ratio for the back end micro electronic device manufacturers was for the three month period ended december  historically  a significant portion of our revenues in each quarter and year has been derived from sales to relatively few end user customers  and we expect this trend to continue 
for the years ended december   and  sales to end user customers that individually represented at least five percent of our revenues accounted for   and of our revenues  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  sales to intel accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
we do not have purchase contracts with any of our customers that obligate them to continue to purchase our products  and they could cease purchasing products from us at any time 
a delay in purchase or cancellation by any of our large customers could cause quarterly revenues to vary significantly 
in addition  during a given quarter  a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from the sale of a relatively small number of systems 
our transparent film measurement systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system  our opaque film measurement systems range in average selling price from 
table of contents approximately  to million per system and our macro defect inspection systems range in average selling price from approximately  to million per system 
accordingly  a small change in the number of systems we sell may also cause significant changes in our operating results 
because fluctuations in the timing of orders from our major customers or in the number of our individual systems we sell could cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly in any given quarter or year  we do not believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are necessarily meaningful  and they should not be relied upon exclusively as an indication of our future performance 
a significant portion of our revenues has been derived from customers outside of the united states 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
in  approximately of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  of which were derived from customers in asia and were derived from customers in europe 
we expect that revenues generated from customers outside of the united states will continue to account for a significant percentage of our revenues 
effective october  we opened a direct sales and support operation in japan 
the operation offers our customers in japan a direct link to us 
we have established a main office in takatsu  japan  with branch operations in osaka and on kyushu island 
we currently have an installed base of more than metrology tools in japan 
tokyo electron limited previously served as our japanese distributor for over twenty years 
the transition from our distributor arrangement with tokyo electron limited was completed in the fourth quarter of as part of the transition  our operations were staffed with some of the same support personnel that supported our products at tokyo electron limited 
as a result  our operations in japan have increased our infrastructure costs and impact our gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the sales cycle for our systems typically ranges from six to months  and can be longer when our customers are evaluating new technology 
due to the length of these cycles  we invest significantly in research and development and sales and marketing in advance of generating revenues related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect  our expenses and inventory levels may increase relative to revenues and total assets 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our statements of operations data as percentages of our revenues 
our results of operations are reported as one business segment

table of contents results of operations  and revenues 
our revenues are derived from the sale of our systems  services  spare parts and software licensing 
our revenues were million  million and million in the years  and these changes represent a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the increase is primarily related to the august technology merger 
the following table lists  for the periods indicated  the different sources of our revenues in dollars and as percentages of our total revenues year ended december  systems metrology inspection parts services software licensing total revenue systems revenue decreased from to due to a softening in demand in the semiconductor capital equipment manufacturing sector 
the increase in systems revenue from to reflects additional revenues of million related to the august technology merger and an increase in metrology systems revenues of million 
systems revenue generated by our latest product releases and major enhancements in each of our product families amounted to of total revenue for compared to of total revenue for and of total revenue for parts and services revenues increased from to as customers spent more on repair and maintenance of their existing equipment 
in addition  parts and service revenue increased in as a result of our direct sales operations in japan 
the year over year increase in parts and services revenues in absolute dollars from to reflects additional parts and service revenues of million related to the august technology merger as well as customers continuing to spend more on repair and maintenance of their existing equipment 
parts and services revenues are generated from part sales  maintenance service contracts  system upgrades  as well as time and material billable service calls 
software licensing revenues increased from to due to the august technology merger 
deferred revenues of million are recorded in other current liabilities at december  and primarily consist of million for licensing agreements  million for deferred maintenance agreements and million for systems awaiting acceptance and outstanding deliverables 
gross profit 
our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including inventory step up from purchase accounting  manufacturing efficiencies  excess and obsolete inventory write offs  pricing by competitors or suppliers  new product introductions  product sales mix  production volume  customization and reconfiguration of systems  international and domestic sales mix  and parts and service margins 
our gross profit was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to customer support and fixed manufacturing costs representing a larger component of cost of goods sold on a lower revenue base 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to higher sales volume  partially offset by charges to cost of goods sold including a million charge for the sale of inventory written up to fair value upon the merger and million in charges related to duplicative inventory 
research and development 
the thin film transparent  opaque process control and macro defect inspection market is characterized by continuous technological development and product innovations 
we believe that the rapid and ongoing development of new products and enhancements to existing products  including the transition to copper and low k dielectrics  the progression to mm wafers  the continuous shrinkage in critical 
table of contents dimensions  and the evolution of ultra thin gate process control  is critical to our success 
accordingly  we devote a significant portion of our technical  management and financial resources to research and development programs 
research and development expenditures consist primarily of salaries and related expenses of employees engaged in research  design and development activities 
they also include consulting fees and the cost of related supplies 
our research and development expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar decrease from to is primarily attributed to reduced headcount  the timing of our subcontractor programs and the timing of our new product releases 
the year over year dollar increase from to primarily reflects additional research and development cost of million related to the merged activities of august technology and increased compensation costs including share based compensation costs 
we continue to maintain our commitment to investing in new product development and enhancement to existing products as we position ourselves for future growth 
in process research and development 
the merger with august technology resulted in our recording of a one time expense of million for the write off of in process research and development  or iprd 
at the time of the merger  we determined that the iprd had not reached technological feasibility and that it did not have an alternative future use 
the purchased in process technology projects  which are comprised of macro defect inspection and software projects  had a value assigned to them of million and million  respectively 
the defect inspection projects  relate to the next generation of our axi defect detection systems with enhanced defect capture capabilities  and were approximately complete as of the date of merger 
the estimated costs to complete these projects consisted primarily of internal engineering labor costs and were completed by the third quarter of the software projects  relate to new enhancement features to our next generation inspection products  and were approximately complete as of the date of merger  with the remaining cost to complete consisting primarily of internal software development labor cost 
the software projects will be completed in we generated revenue from the inspection project in the third quarter of and anticipate revenue to be generated from the software projects in if we are not successful in completing the software projects on a timely basis  the future sales of our inspection products may be adversely affected resulting in erosion of our market share 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs for sales  marketing  and general administrative personnel  as well as commissions and other non personnel related expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the year over year dollar increase from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to a full year impact of our operations in japan of million  increased sales and administrative costs at our branch offices of million  the consolidation of facilities of million and increased cash and equity compensation costs of million 
the year over year dollar increase from to in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily due to million related to merged activities of august technology and increased compensation costs interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income and other  net for consisted primarily of interest income of million 
the decrease in interest income and other  net of million from to is primarily due to the litigation settlement income of million received in the increase in interest income and other  net of million from to is primarily due to higher invested cash balances and higher interest rates 
income taxes 
income tax expense was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of primarily as a function of benefits realized from research and development tax credits  extraterritorial income exclusion and tax exempt interest 
in addition  in  our effective tax rate was impacted by the non deductibility of the million iprd charge for tax purposes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
at december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and million in working capital 
at december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million  while working capital amounted to million 
typically during periods of revenue growth  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a use of cash as we incur costs and expend cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
similarly  during periods of declining revenue  changes in accounts receivable and inventories represent a source of cash as inventory purchases decline and revenue from prior periods is collected 
however  in  as our revenues declined from million to million  our change in accounts receivables represented a use of cash 
this was primarily due to longer collection times from our japanese customers 
because of the lack of visibility in projected sales for  we are uncertain as to the level of expected cash to be provided from operating activities in in  operating activities used million in cash 
net cash provided by operating activities in and totaled million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in was primarily due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  partially offset by profit before depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease of million in net deferred tax assets  an increase in accrued liabilities of million  an increase in other current liabilities of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and a decrease in income taxes receivable of million

in  net cash provided by financing activities was a result of proceeds received from sales of shares through share based compensation plans of million and tax benefit from share based compensation plans of million 

table of contents from time to time we evaluate whether to acquire new or complementary businesses  products and or technologies 
we may fund all or a portion of the purchase price of these acquisitions in cash 
on february   we completed our merger with august technology corporation 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to former august technology shareholders 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the timing and amount of our revenues and our investment decisions  which will affect our ability to generate additional cash 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
thereafter  if cash generated from operations and financing activities is insufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements  we may seek additional funding through bank borrowings  sales of securities or other means 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise any such capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations open and committed purchase orders total off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity and capital resources 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  business acquisitions  intangible assets  share based payments  income taxes and warranty obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis  and by the audit committee at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our products are sold and accounted for as multiple element arrangements  consisting primarily of the sale of the product  software  installation and training services 
we generally recognize product revenue upon shipment 
when customer acceptance is subjective and not obtained prior to shipment  we defer 
table of contents product revenue until such time as positive affirmation of acceptance has been obtained from the customer 
customer acceptance is generally based on our products meeting published performance specifications 
the amount of revenue allocated to the shipment of products is done on a residual method basis 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered contract elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to product revenue 
the fair value of installation and training services is based upon billable hourly rates and the estimated time to complete the service 
revenue related to undelivered installation services is deferred until such time as installation is completed at the customer s site 
revenue related to training services is recognized ratably over the training period 
revenue from software license fees is recognized upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement 
such undelivered elements in these arrangements typically consist of follow on support 
if vendor specific objective evidence does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  all revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the support period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or our assumptions are otherwise incorrect  additional allowances may be required 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down our excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future product life cycles  product demand and market conditions 
if actual product life cycles  product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business acquisitions 
we account for acquired or merged businesses using the purchase method of accounting which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the date of acquisition or merger at their respective fair values 
the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as asset lives  can materially impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accordingly  for significant items  we typically obtain assistance from independent valuation specialists 
there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
for intangible assets  we normally utilize the income method 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the projected future cash flows including timing and the discount rate reflecting the risks inherent in the future cash flows 
determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment 
for example  different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives and certain assets may even be considered to have indefinite useful lives 
all of these judgments and estimates can significantly impact our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the purchase price is preliminarily allocated based on estimates of the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the final valuation of net assets is expected to be completed within one year from the acquisition or merger date 
at the acquisition or merger date  we begin to formulate a plan to exit or restructure certain activities  if applicable 
as we finalize our plans to exit or restructure activities  we may record additional liabilities for  among other things  severance and severance related costs  which would also increase the goodwill recorded 

table of contents the developed technology acquired in connection with the merger with august technology is separated into front end and back end automated macro defect inspection  and analysis software and is utilized in the manufacturing of semiconductor chips 
this technology is designed to automate inspection processes that are performed by the human eye through the use of imaging technology and high speed computers 
the process of forming transistors directly on silicon wafers is commonly referred to as the front end process 
the front end products provide high speed automated inspection of chips  cracks and other defects that occur during the chip manufacturing process 
the merged company s product offering in this area is the axi series  which is an automated defect inspection system 
once the various semiconductor devices have been created they must be interconnected to form the desired electrical circuits 
this back end process involves creating metal interconnecting wires that are separated by insulating materials 
the back end products provide inspection of the chips to detect defects created during the back end manufacturing process 
the back end products include the nsx series  which are flexible automated wafer and die defect inspection systems for high speed  consistent  reliable defect detection 
the software technology is used to analyze and process the data provided during front end and back end inspection 
the software provides rapid classification of defects as well as providing possible correlation among them by creating a database of prior issues and defects 
this aids our customers in making adjustments to the manufacturing processes to help reduce the number of defects and enable consistent performance among separate machines 
the software products include fabrication wide data management software  and tool specific defect review and process analysis software 
paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
provides guidance concerning the recognition of value associated with intangible assets and refers to an illustrative list in appendix a of sfas no 
of commonly identifiable intangible assets that meet the criteria for recognition as assets apart from goodwill 
this list includes technology based intangible assets  such as patented technology and computer software 
the developed technology acquired represents proprietary know how that was technologically feasible as of the merger date and is supported by patents 
a useful life of nine years was assigned for each of the front end  back end and software developed technologies 
the basis for assigning these lives was derived from a number of factors including the valuation of the developed technology  the expected life cycle of the technology  and the remaining lives of the underlying patents 
the valuation  which was performed by an independent third party valuation firm  was based on projected cash flows for each of the developed technologies 
after the ninth year  the cash flows generated from the developed technologies decline to a nominal amount 
the life cycle of the technology is in its early stages of development due to advancements in computers and camera technology  and has only recently begun to achieve semiconductor industry acceptance 
as such  risk of technology obsolescence is minimized until the later stages of the life cycle 
in evaluating the patents underlying the acquired technology  the remaining lives of the patents range from to years 
we determined that the decline in cash flows to a nominal amount was a principle factor in determining the life of the technology 
as such  we believe that a life of nine years assigned to the developed technology is appropriate 
goodwill 
our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is december st or prior to the next annual testing date if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make judgmental assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using market capitalization and a number of judgmental factors including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
we compare the estimated fair values of each reporting unit to the respective carrying values which includes allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination 
table of contents requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
we believe our estimates of the underlying components of fair value are reasonable 
however  should actual results not meet our expectations or assumptions change in future years  our impairment assessment could result in a lower fair value estimate which could result in an impairment charge that may materially affect the carrying value of our assets and results from operations 
long lived assets and acquired intangible assets 
we periodically review long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the determination of impairment losses  such as future cash flows and disposition costs  may affect the carrying value of long lived assets and the impairment of such long lived assets  if any  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for share based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of share based compensation transactions in the statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock options is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
we use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation cost 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our share grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
the need for a valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred taxes will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million for a portion of the deferred tax assets attributable to foreign net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty of future earnings of our subsidiaries in europe and japan 
during  the entire valuation allowance of million was reversed as the net operating losses of our subsidiaries in europe and japan were utilized

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments us treasury and agency securities and corporate bonds 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of issuers from our available for sale securities 
it is possible that we are at risk if interest rates or credit ratings of issuers change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss will be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
based on sensitivity analysis performed on our financial investments held as of december   an immediate adverse change of in interest rates eg to would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
foreign currency risk we have branch operations in taiwan  singapore  china and korea and wholly owned subsidiaries in europe and japan 
our international subsidiaries and branches operate primarily using local functional currencies 
these foreign branches and subsidiaries are limited in their operations and level of investment so that the risk of currency fluctuations is not material 
a substantial portion of our international systems sales are denominated in us dollars with the exception of japan and  as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to these sales 
substantially all our sales in japan are denominated in japanese yen 
from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to economically hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur within months 
the change in fair value of the forward contracts is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations each reporting period 
as of december  and  we had eight and fifteen forward contracts outstanding  respectively 
the total notional contract value of these outstanding forward contracts at december  and was million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes
