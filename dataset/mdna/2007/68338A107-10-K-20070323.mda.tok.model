item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading video compression technology firm 
we have developed a proprietary technology platform and video compression decompression software codec to allow the efficient storage of high quality video and delivery of that video at the lowest possible data rates over proprietary networks and the internet to personal computers  wireless devices and set top boxes 
we offer a suite of products and services based on our proprietary compression technology and multimedia server software 
our service offerings include customized engineering  consulting services  technical support 
table of contents and high level video encoding 
in addition  we license our software products  which include video and audio codecs and encoding and server software  for use with video delivery platforms 
we have also recently begun to license software that encodes video in the adobe macromedia flash format  the flash format uses our vp video codec 
company history founded in as the duck corporation  a privately owned entity  we originally developed and marketed compression technology that enabled developers of computer video games  video games for dedicated video game consoles and multi media presentations on computers to convert an analog video signal to a digital video signal  and to compress the signal for storage and playback on the required device 
in june of  the duck corporation was merged with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of applied capital funding  inc  a public company whose name was concurrently changed to oncom inc and subsequently changed to on technologies  inc at that time  we had developed proprietary technology that enabled the compression  storage and streaming of high quality video signals over high bandwidth networks ie broadband 
we adopted a business model in which we would develop our own broadband content network powered by our proprietary technology 
we intended to generate revenue through advertising sales and electronic commerce 
from june of  through the first quarter of  we made three acquisitions metavisual creations limited metavisual  celebrity interviews cii and quickband networks  inc quickband 
metavisual was a compression technology firm located in the united kingdom and had developed its own video compression technology 
that technology is instrumental in the compression technology we offer today 
by the second quarter of  with the rapid decline in the internet industry and the lack of interest in content networks  we determined that operating a content network would not be profitable for the foreseeable future 
based on market conditions  we decided to cease production on our content network and developed a strategic business model to distribute our video compression technology to ip based clients as well as those offering video through proprietary networks  consumer electronics and wireless devices 
this is the business model under which we currently operate 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we have limited experience forecasting our revenues and operating costs 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance 
to date  we have incurred substantial costs to create technology products and services 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we will continue to incur costs to develop  introduce and enhance products and services  build brand awareness and expand our business 
we may also incur significant additional costs related to technology  marketing or acquisitions of businesses and technologies to respond to changes in this rapidly developing industry 
these costs may not correspond with any meaningful increases in revenues in the near term  if at all  and may therefore result in negative operating cash flows until such time as we generate sufficient revenues to offset such costs 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
we have disclosed all significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto should be read in conjunction with the following discussion of our critical accounting policies 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are revenue recognition equity based compensation valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
table of contents revenue recognition 
we currently recognize revenue from professional services and the sale of software licenses 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in determining the amount of revenue recognized in any given accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any given accounting period depending upon judgments made by or estimates utilized by management 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  deferral of the effective date of sop  software revenue recognition and sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions sop 
under each arrangement  revenues are recognized when a non cancelable agreement has been signed and the customer acknowledges an unconditional obligation to pay  the products or applications have been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding customer acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
revenues recognized from multiple element software arrangements are allocated to each element of the arrangement based on the fair values of the elements  such as product licenses  post contract customer support  or training 
the determination of the fair value is based on the vendor specific objective evidence available to us 
if such evidence of the fair value of each element of the arrangement does not exist  we defer all revenue from the arrangement until such time that evidence of the fair value does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
our software licensing arrangements typically consist of two elements a software license and post contract customer support pcs 
we recognize license revenues based on the residual method after all elements other than pcs have been delivered as prescribed by sop we recognize pcs revenues over the term of the maintenance contract or on a per usage basis  whichever is stated in the contract 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of pcs is determined by reference to the price the customer will have to pay for pcs when it is sold separately ie the renewal rate 
most of our license agreements offer additional pcs at a stated price 
revenue is recognized on a per copy basis for licensed software when each copy of the licensed software purchased by the customer or reseller is delivered 
we do not allow returns  exchanges or price protection for sales of software licenses to our customers or resellers  and we do not allow our resellers to purchase software licenses under consignment arrangements 
when engineering and consulting services are sold together with a software license  the arrangement typically requires customization and integration of the software into a third party hardware platform 
in these arrangements  we require the customer to pay a fixed fee for the engineering and consulting services and a licensing fee in the form of a per unit royalty 
we account for engineering and consulting arrangements in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  sop 
when reliable estimates are available for the costs and efforts necessary to complete the engineering or consulting services and those services do not include contractual milestones or other acceptance criteria  we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion contract method based upon input measures  such as hours 
when such estimates are not available  we defer all revenue recognition until we have completed the contract and have no further obligations to the customer 
encoding services consist of services that convert video and audio content into formats for delivery to end users 
encoding services are generally provided under per unit or time and materials contracts 
under these contracts  we recognize revenue when services have been rendered and we have no further interest or obligation in the goods and services  which is generally the date on which the goods or services have been delivered to the customer 
equity based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations as an operating expense  based on their fair values on grant date 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january   using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  non cash compensation expense is recognized under the fair value method for the portion of outstanding share based awards granted prior to the adoption of sfas r for which service has not been rendered  and for any future share based awards granted or modified after adoption 
accordingly  periods prior to adoption have not been restated 
we recognize share based compensation cost associated with awards subject to graded vesting in accordance with the accelerated method specified in fasb interpretation no 
pursuant to which each vesting tranche is treated as a separate award 
the compensation cost associated with each vesting tranche is recognized as expense evenly over the vesting period of that tranche 

table of contents valuation of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas requires goodwill and other intangible assets to be tested for impairment at least annually  and written off when impaired  rather than being amortized as previously required 
long lived assets and identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
as of december   we believe that no such impairment has occurred 
results of operations revenue 
our revenue for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively  and was derived from the sale of software licenses  engineering and consulting services and license royalties 
our revenue increased  for the year ended december  as compared with the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in license sales of our flix product line and license royalties

in august  we completed the sale of  shares of its common stock with detachable five year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  to two institutional investors  led by midsummer investments ltd  and received net proceeds of  the warrants contain certain anti dilution provisions and  accordingly  we accounted for the fair value of the warrants as a derivative liability warrant derivative liability subject to sfas no 
the fair value of the warrants issued  as calculated using the black scholes pricing model  was  and represents the portion of the proceeds from the financing that was attributed to the warrant derivative liability

 fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
we must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we will adopt the provisions of this statement beginning in the first quarter of the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  which requires employers to a recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s over funded status or a liability for a plan s under funded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income of a business entity 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december   for entities with publicly traded equity securities 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we currently have no post retirement benefit plan 
also in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures 
table of contents about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
we believe that several accounts will be affected on the adoption of sfas no 
statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at their fair values 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
we are currently evaluating the effects of the adoption of sfas no 
limitation on use of net operating loss and other tax credit carry forwards at december   we had available net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  the net operating loss carry forwards expire at various dates through section of the internal revenue code provides that when a corporation undergoes an ownership change  the corporation s use of its net operating losses is limited in each subsequent year 
an ownership change occurs when  as of any testing date  the sum of the increases in ownership of each shareholder that owns five percent or more of the value of a company s stock as compared to that shareholder s lowest percentage ownership during the preceding three year period exceeds fifty percentage points 
for purposes of this rule  certain shareholders who own less than five percent of a company s stock are aggregated and treated as a single five percent stockholder 
the merger of the duck corporation with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of applied capital funding  inc in may have involved an ownership change  and thus we may be unable to use a material portion of our available net operating loss carry forwards 
furthermore  in the ordinary course of our business operations we have and may continue to issue shares in conjunction with acquisitions or additional financing  to meet our growth objectives and liquidity constraints 
in addition  the exercise of outstanding warrants and certain options to purchase shares of our common stock may require us to issue additional shares of common stock 
past and future issuances of shares of common stock may limit our ability to use a substantial amount of our available net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future taxable income 
the extent of the actual future use of our net operating loss carry forwards is subject to inherent uncertainty because it depends on the amount of otherwise taxable income we may earn 
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to use any of our net operating loss carry forwards before they would otherwise expire 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently have any material exposure to interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  exchange rate risk  commodity price risk or other relevant market rate or price risks 
however  we do have some exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations arising from maintaining an office for our uk based  wholly owned subsidiary which transacts business in the local functional currency and from paying consulting fees to certain of its european based sales contractors in euros 
our uk based subsidiary does not conduct any sales and all their costs are funded in united states dollars 
to date  we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument to manage foreign currency risk  and we are not currently evaluating the future use of any such financial instruments
