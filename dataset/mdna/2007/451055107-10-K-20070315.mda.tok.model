overview the company is a brand management company engaged in licensing  marketing and providing trend direction for a diversified and growing consumer brand portfolio 
the company s brands are sold across every major segment of retail distribution  from luxury to mass 
as of december   the company owned nine iconic consumer brands candie s  bongo  badgley mischka  joe boxer  rampage  mudd  london fog  mossimo  and ocean pacific 
the company licenses its brands worldwide through over retail and wholesale licenses for use in connection with a broad variety of product categories  including women s  men s and children s apparel  footwear and accessories  home furnishings and beauty and fragrance 
the company s business model allows it to focus on its core competencies of marketing and managing brands without some of the risks and investment requirements associated with a more traditional operating company 
its licensing agreements with leading retail and wholesale partners throughout the world provide the company with a predictable stream of guaranteed minimum royalties 
the company s growth strategy is focused on increasing licensing revenue from its existing portfolio of brands through adding new product categories  expanding its brands retail penetration and optimizing the sales of its licensees 
the company will also seek to continue the international expansion of its brands by partnering with leading licensees throughout the world 
finally  the company believes it will continue to acquire iconic consumer brands with an applicability to a wide range of merchandise categories and an ability to further diversify its brand portfolio 
background transition to current business model commencing in may  the company began to implement a shift in its business model designed to transform it from a wholesaler and retailer of jeanswear and footwear products to a brand management company focused on licensing and marketing its portfolio of consumer brands 
in may  the company licensed out both its bongo footwear business and its candie s footwear business to third party licensees  and  by the end of  the company had eliminated all of its candie s retail concept stores 
thereafter  effective in august  the company also licensed out its bongo jeanswear operations  which were previously conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary  unzipped  and  by the end of  the company had reduced its workforce from over employees to under beginning january  the company also changed its business practices with respect to its bright star subsidiary  as a result of which bright star began acting solely as an agent for  as opposed to an indirect wholesaler to  its private label footwear clients 
in july  the company entered into its first multi category retail license  with kohl s  and between october and september  the company acquired three new brands badgley mischka  joe boxer and rampage 
as a result of these changes to its operations  the company is now a brand management company that focuses exclusively on licensing  marketing and providing trend direction with respect to a diverse portfolio of owned consumer brands and that no longer has any wholesale or retail operations or product inventory 
changes in our financial reporting on december   the company announced that beginning january   it had changed its fiscal year ending on january  to a calendar year beginning on january st and ending on december st

as a result  the company reported on an month year for the period february  through december  the month prior period 
the company s current reporting period is for the month period january  through december  the current year  as is the prior year reporting period from january  through december  the prior year 
commencing with fiscal  revenues from bright star are recognized solely from its net agent commissions and no longer from gross product sales as they were prior to the change in the company s business practices with respect to bright star described above 
in addition  for the fiscal years ending prior to fiscal  the company s operations were comprised of two reportable segments its licensing commission footwear segment  which included candie s footwear  bongo footwear  private label footwear  bright star s operations  retail store operations and licensing operations  and its apparel segment  which was comprised of unzipped s bongo jeanswear operations 
as a result of the company s shift in business model  including its licensing of the activities associated with its former candie s and bongo footwear and apparel operations  the company now has only one revenue reporting segment  its licensing and commission segment  which includes the licensing revenues for all of its brands and bright star s net commission revenues 
as a result of the company s transition to a brand management business  and to a lesser extent  its change in fiscal year end  its operating results for the periods after the month prior period are not  and are not expected to be  comparable to prior years

current year compared to prior year revenues 
revenue for the current year increased to million  from million in the prior year 
this revenue growth was driven by three factors growth from brands acquired prior to  additional revenue from brands acquired during the prior year and brands acquired in the current year 
the growth in revenue from brands that were acquired prior to  notably the company s candies brand  that is licensed to kohl s  amounted to million 
additional revenue from brands that were acquired during the prior year  notably the joe boxer brand  that is licensed to kmart  and the rampage brand  amounted to approximately million

 including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carry forwards nol s pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of the company s business

prior year compared to the month prior period revenues 
consolidated net revenue decreased in the prior year by million to million  from million in the month prior period due to the company s change in its business model from one based upon sales generated from its former footwear and jeanswear operations to one based upon royalties generated by licensing and brand management activity 
the licensing business drove an increase of million in licensing revenue to million for the prior year  up from million in the month prior period 
the increase in licensing income resulted from a combination of the acquisition of the joe boxer brand in  which generated million in revenue  the acquisition of rampage in september  which generated million in revenue  and the launch of the company s candie s brand in kohl s  which generated million in revenue 
due to a change in revenue recognition resulting from its change of business practice beginning january  bright star recorded only the net commission earned on sales in the prior year and will continue to do so in the future 
as a result  there was million in commission revenue and no sales recorded in the prior year for bright star  as compared to million in commission revenue and million in sales excluding commission revenue in the month prior period

in the prior year  there was no reportable gross profit from unzipped s jeanswear operations  as compared to million of gross profit in the month prior period which reflects the liquidation of the remaining bongo inventory in connection with the transition of the jeanswear business to a licensing arrangement 
the overall increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in licensing revenue which has no related cost of good sold 
bright star s gross profit increased to million in the prior year from million in the month prior period 
operating expenses 
sg a expenses totaled million in the prior year compared to million in the month prior period  an increase of million 
the company s sg a expenses related to licensing increased by million to million in the prior year compared to million in the month prior period 
this increase resulted primarily from the company s acquisitions of the joe boxer  rampage and badgley mischka brands 
sg a expenses related to bright star were  in the prior year compared to  in the month prior period

as stipulated in the management agreement  sweet guarantees that the net income of unzipped would be no less than million for each year during the term the guarantee 
in the event that the guarantee is not met  sweet is obligated to pay to the company the difference between the actual net income of unzipped  as defined  and the guarantee the shortfall payment

the interest expense related to the asset backed notes issued by ip holdings  was million in the prior year compared to million in the month prior period 
in addition   in interest expense was included in the prior year from the sweet note as compared to  in the month prior period

a total of  in interest income for the prior year partially offset the increase in interest expense  compared to  in the month prior period 
gain on sales of securities 
in the prior year  the gross realized gain on sales of securities available for sale totaled  there was no such gain in the month prior period 
provision benefit for income taxes 
in the prior year  a net non cash tax benefit of million was recognized by reducing the deferred tax assets valuation allowance based on the company s projection of future taxable income and the expectation that realizing this portion of the related deferred tax assets is more likely than not offset by a reduction in the deferred tax asset established in the purchase accounting for the joe boxer acquisition 
management prepared projections that indicate that a portion of the company s nol s would be utilized prior to their expiration 
however  the company does not believe that the future realization of all of these future tax benefits indicated by its projections is sufficiently assured to allow their full recognition in the consolidated financial statements 
in particular  projections of operating results over an extended period are inherently imprecise 
there was no tax expense on income reported for the month prior period due to a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance that offset the income tax provision 
at december   the company had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million compared to million at december   which management believes will be recoverable from anticipated future profits

the benefit of the utilization of this nol will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital if and when the related deferred tax asset is recorded 
net income loss 
the company recorded net income of million in the prior year  compared to net income of  in the month prior period  as a result of the factors discussed above

the company funded the acquisition of danskin from its cash reserves 
the proposed rocawear acquisition will be funded from the proceeds of a loan

seasonality the majority of the products manufactured and sold under the company s brands and licenses are for apparel  accessories and footwear  which sales vary as a result of holidays  weather  and the timing of product shipments 
accordingly  a portion of the company s revenue from its licensees  particularly from those mature licensees that are performing and actual sales royalties exceed minimum royalties  is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
the results of operations in any quarter therefore will not necessarily be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year or any future quarter 
other factors we continue to seek to expand and diversify the types of licensed products being produced under our various brands  as well as diversify the distribution channels within which licensed products are sold  in an effort to reduce dependence on any particular retailer  consumer or market sector 
the success of our company  however  will still remain largely dependent on our ability to build and maintain brand awareness and contract with and retain key licensees and on our licensees ability to accurately predict upcoming fashion trends within their respective customer bases and fulfill the product requirements of their particular retail channels within the global marketplace 
unanticipated changes in consumer fashion preferences  slowdowns in the us economy  changes in the prices of supplies  consolidation of retail establishments  and other factors noted in risk factors  could adversely affect our licensees ability to meet and or exceed their contractual commitments to us and thereby adversely affect our future operating results 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced over the past few years in the united states  where it primarily competes  have had a significant effect on revenues or profitability

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while the company continues to evaluate its historical tax positions 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or our financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial asset and financial liability including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the standard permits all entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  we are evaluating the impact adopting sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies during the current year  the company adopted certain new accounting standards issued by the fasb  as described above and summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the adoption of these new accounting standards did not have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations in the current year 
several of the company s accounting policies involve management judgments and estimates that could be significant 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial position include the estimate of reserves to provide for the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company estimates the net collectibility considering historical  current and anticipated trends related to deductions taken by customers and markdowns provided to retail customers to effectively flow goods through the retail channels  and the possibility of non collection due to the financial position of its licensees customers 
with its new licensing model  the company has eliminated its inventory risk and substantially reduced its operating risks  and can now reasonably forecast revenues and plan expenditures based upon guaranteed royalty minimums 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews all significant estimates affecting the financial statements on a recurring basis and records the effect of any adjustments when necessary 
in connection with its new licensing model  the company has entered into various trademark license agreements that provide revenues based on minimum royalties and additional revenues based on a percentage of defined sales 
minimum royalty revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over each period  as defined  in each license agreement 
royalties exceeding the defined minimum amounts are recognized as income during the period corresponding to the licensee s sales 
also in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon the company s adoption of sfas no 
on february   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
as prescribed under sfas no 
 the company had goodwill tested for impairment during the current year  the prior year  and the month prior period  and no impairments were necessary 
the candie s and bongo trademarks had previously been amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of approximately years 
effective july   the company changed for accounting purposes  the estimated useful lives of the candie s and bongo trademarks to be an indefinite life 
accordingly  the recorded value of these trademarks will no longer be amortized  but instead will be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
in arriving at the conclusion to use an indefinite life management considered among other things  the company s new licensing business model which has expanded the extent of potential use of these brand names in future years 
in connection with the candies license signed with kohl s in late the candie s name  which has been in the us market since the s  has been expanded to over product categories in almost kohl s retail locations 
similarly  the bongo brand has expanded from a predominantly jeanswear brand to a broad variety of product groups and multiple licenses in the us and internationally 
brand recognition for both of these brands is very high  has been generally stable for an extended period of time  and the company expects this consumer recognition and acceptance to remain stable or grow in the future based on anticipated broader distribution and product line expansion 
the impact of this change in estimate for the prior year was a reduction in amortization expense relating to the candie s and bongo trademarks totaling  or per fully diluted earning per share 
as of december   the net book value of the candie s and bongo trademarks totaled million 
impairment losses are recognized for long lived assets  including certain intangibles  used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are not sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured by comparing the fair value of the assets to their carrying amount 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for share based payment  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
under sfas r  using the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  in december  our board of directors approved the accelerated vesting of all employee service based stock options previously granted under our various non qualified stock option plans  which would have been unvested as of december  as a result  all options granted as of december   except certain options based on performance  became exercisable immediately 
the number of shares  exercise prices and other terms of the options subject to the acceleration remain unchanged 
the acceleration of such option vesting resulted in an additional  of compensation expense reflected in pro forma net income for the year ended december   an amount that would have otherwise been recorded as compensation expense in the years ending december  and  but had no impact on compensation recognition in as the options would have otherwise vested 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  the compensation cost for stock options had been measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of the grant over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
the impact on our financial condition and results of operations from the adoption of sfas no 
r will depend on the number and terms of stock options granted in future years under the modified prospective method  the amount of which we cannot currently estimate 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 sfas accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carry forwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of the company s business 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including the company s completed transition into a licensing business  estimates of future profitability based on projected royalty revenues from its licensees  and the overall prospects of the company s business  management concluded in the current year that it is more likely than not that the net deferred income tax asset recorded as of december  will be realized 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements
