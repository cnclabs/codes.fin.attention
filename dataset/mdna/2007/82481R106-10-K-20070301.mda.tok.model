item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
as described in note a of part iv of this annual report  the financial statements for the year to december  have been restated in respect of the value ascribed to ipr d  acquired as part of the tkt acquisition and subsequently written off as required under us gaap in the quarter ended september  ipr d represented those assets which  at the time of the acquisition  had not been approved by the fda or other regulatory authorities  including is now known as elaprase and ga gcb 
the company has determined that the value ascribed to ipr d acquired as a result of the tkt acquisition did not include the benefit of tax amortization as required by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices  and pharmaceutical industries 
the effect of this omission was to understate the value of ipr d expensed in the year to december  by million  with a corresponding overstatement of goodwill as at december  overview shire s strategic goal is to become the leading specialty pharmaceutical company that focuses on meeting the needs of the specialist physician 
shire focuses its business on adhd  hgt  gi and renal diseases 
the structure is sufficiently flexible to allow shire to target new therapeutic areas to the extent opportunities arise through acquisitions 
shire believes that a carefully selected portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively small scale sales forces will deliver strong results 
shire s focused strategy is to develop and market products for specialist physicians 
shire s in licensing  merger and acquisition efforts are focused on products in niche markets with strong intellectual property protection either in the us or europe 
on february   consistent with its stated focus on the growing adhd market  shire announced that it had agreed to acquire new river pharmaceuticals inc allowing shire to progress and benefit from its successful strategy of acquiring  developing and marketing specialty pharmaceutical products 
substantially all of the company s revenues  expenditures  operating profits or losses and net assets are attributable to the r d  manufacture  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within two operating segments pharmaceutical products and royalties 
revenues are derived primarily from two sources sales of the company s own products and royalties where shire has out licensed products to third parties of total revenues are derived from product sales  of which is from adderall xr 
all product sales fall within the pharmaceutical products segment  of total revenues are derived from royalties 
all royalty income falls within the royalties segment 
shire s strategic objectives are set using a balanced scorecard approach 
objectives are also set at the functional  market and therapeutic area levels and are aligned with the group wide strategic objectives 
the company therefore takes a fully integrated approach to strategic management 
key performance indicators kpis are used to measure achievement of the objectives 
strategic objectives are categorized into fields financial  products markets  people capabilities and operational excellence 
for  shire s corporate objectives included defined levels of revenue growth  target sales and contributions for core products and markets  execution of defined therapeutic area strategic and operational plans  product in licensing targets  drug application filing and launch targets for new products  maintenance of a stable and effective supply chain  implementation of an effective leadership development program  implementation of defined it systems  and maintenance of robust risk management practices including internal controls 
the markets in which the company conducts its business are highly competitive and highly regulated 
the health care industry is experiencing pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep prices low while increasing access to drugs  increased r d costs as clinical studies are typically larger and take longer to get approval from regulators  challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers  low cost generic drugs entering the market on expiration of patent protection  and higher marketing costs due to the use of direct to consumer campaigns and competition for market share 
shire s strategy to become the leading specialty pharmaceutical company has been developed to address these industry wide competitive pressures 
this strategy has resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas markets historically  shire s portfolio of approved products has been heavily weighted towards the north american market 
with the acquisition of tkt in  shire substantially increased its presence in europe and thereby diversified the risk associated with being reliant on one geographic market 
through the tkt acquisition  shire acquired elaprase global rights  replagal which is presently sold only outside the us and dynepo to which the company has exclusive marketing rights outside the us 
in addition  and saw the european launches of xagrid and fosrenol respectively 
for  sales outside north america represented approximately of total net product sales and shire expects this upward trend to continue in shire s late stage development pipeline contains a number of products with global rights  including ga gcb acquired as part of the tkt acquisition  daytrana and vyvanse 
the company intends to launch these products in both the us and europe  thus furthering the company s european expansion 
shire s continued expansion in europe will be driven by the development of products with patent protection in both the north american and european markets wherever possible 
in and the first half of  europe should see the continued roll out of fosrenol  the launch of elaprase  the launch of dynepo  the launch of mezavant 
in and the first half of  the us should see the continued roll out of daytrana and elaprase  the launch of lialda  the launch of vyvanse  a regulatory response on the ndas for spd and spd  which were filed in this program of new product launches will require significant investment in advertising  promotional spend and in some cases  additional sales representatives leading to an increase in overall sg a costs for sg a costs as a proportion of product sales are expected to be similar to the specialist nature of hgt products means that relatively low sg a and infrastructure investment is required  making them ideal products for shire to launch into new markets 
saw the expansion of replagal in argentina 
shire will continue to consider launching products in new markets where entry barriers are low 
in markets outside north america and europe where products require significant sg a and infrastructure investment  shire will continue to seek out licensing partners 
in  the company successfully out licensed the japanese marketing and development rights for agrylin and fosrenol to two companies with an established presence in this market 
shire s partner dainippon sumitomo pharma co  limited launched replagal in japan in the first quarter of r d over the last three years shire has significantly refocused its r d efforts on products in its core therapeutic areas  which meet the needs of the specialist physician 
the company has also concentrated its resources on obtaining regulatory approval of its later stage pipeline products within its core therapeutic areas 
evidence of the successful execution of this strategy can be seen from the progression of the company s development pipeline over the last three years 
since january  eight products have received regulatory approval in the us including daytrana and elaprase in  lialda in january and vyvanse in february and four in europe including elaprase and mezavant in january  the company has another two products in registration in the us spd and spd 
shire s strategy is focused on the development of product candidates that have a lower risk profile 
shire s acquisition of tkt was driven  in part  by the comparatively low risk of developing protein replacement therapies for genetic disease compared to other drug discovery approaches 
r d costs in will be affected by shire s phase b and phase studies to support new product launches  development of new projects including the women s health franchise  the continuation of phase trials on ga gcb and pre clinical development of three new hgt projects 
patents and market exclusivity the loss or expiration of patent protection or market exclusivity with respect to any of the company s major products could have a material adverse effect on future revenues and net income as generic manufacturers may produce similar drugs and generally be able to sell the company s drugs at a lower price as their costs of development are significantly lower than shire s 
as adderall xr is  in revenue terms  shire s most significant product  representing of total revenues  the loss  expiration or circumvention of patent protection on this product in particular will be material to the company s revenues and earnings 
shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic manufacturers with respect to its adderall xr patents and the patents for certain other products 
these are discussed in more detail in item legal proceedings 
the potential impact of the introduction of generic products is illustrated by the approval in april of several generic versions of agrylin  which as expected  adversely affected shire s sales of this product from this date 
us prescriptions for agrylin in were less than in in consequence of the issues associated with the loss or expiry of patent protection or market exclusivity  shire seeks to focus its business development activity on the acquisition and in licensing of products and projects which have the benefit of long term patent protection and market exclusivity 
business development the company remains active in seeking out opportunities to acquire new products or companies that fit its business strategy and existing therapeutic areas  as well as new complementary therapeutic areas 
in the therapeutic area of cns  shire in licensed the global rights to valrocemide spd and other related compounds from yissum research and development company in july spd is being developed for the treatment of a number of cns disorders 
in the therapeutic areas of renal and hgt  shire in licensed the global rights to tissue protective cytokines spd from warren in september spd is being developed pre clinically in non nervous systems indications  including renal and genetic disease areas 
in august  shire entered the women s health therapeutic area with the acquisition of rights to the transvaginal ring technology of duramed  a subsidiary of barr  in a number of markets outside north america including the larger european markets together with a license in the same countries to duramed s oral contraceptive  seasonique 
seasonique  which is in phase studies in europe  is already approved and marketed by duramed in the us 
as part of its strategy of focusing on drugs with long term patent protection in its core therapeutic areas  the company continued its disposal program of non core assets with the sale to duramed of adderall for million in august adderall was shire s immediate release adhd product which has been subject to generic competition since shire also licensed the us and canadian rights for the investigational hiv compound  spd also known as apricitabine  to the australian biotechnology company avexa on january  shire received an up front cash payment of million  million additional avexa shares taking its shareholding in avexa to just over and may receive further milestones and royalties 
organization and structure during  shire completed the integration of tkt into the company

the total consideration for the acquisition of new river amounts to approximately billion in cash 
shire has entered into new bank facilities of billion to provide part of the financing for the acquisition 
this new facility is conditional upon  amongst other things  approval being given by shire plc s shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting for shire plc to exceed the limit on its aggregate borrowings set out in shire plc s articles of association

the following discussion includes references to prescription and market share data for key products 
the source of this data is ims  december during  the company concluded new fee for service agreements with two of its three significant wholesale customers 
these agreements  which are commonplace in the pharmaceutical industry  change the way wholesalers are compensated 
under the agreements  the wholesalers receive a distribution fee from pharmaceutical suppliers 
these fee for service agreements eliminate wholesalers incentives to acquire and hold excess inventories 
the company believes this will reduce the significant impact of wholesaler stocking and de stocking on its product sales 
further  the wholesalers will provide data regarding their inventories of the company s products it has on hand 
the company is negotiating a fee for service agreement with its remaining significant wholesale customer 
fees for service are treated as a sales deduction  thus affecting revenues rather than cost of sales 
adderall xr us prescriptions for adderall xr for the year to december   were up 
adderall xr further strengthened its position as the leading brand in the us adhd market with a increase in market share to an all time high of in december december 
in addition  the us adhd market grew overall compared to the same period in product sales growth was higher than prescription growth for the year due mainly to the impact of price increases in december and august  partially offset by a decrease in pipeline inventory and higher sales deductions 
fda approval of the adolescent indication for adderall xr was received on july  on february   shire announced that it had suspended sales of adderall xr in canada at the request of health canada 
on august   shire announced that health canada would reinstate the marketing authorization of adderall xr in canada effective august  this reinstatement follows the acceptance by health canada of the recommendations from the new drug committee  which was appointed by health canada at shire s request to review the suspension of adderall xr in canada 
during october  shire filed a citizen petition with the fda requesting that the fda require more rigorous bioequivalence testing or additional clinical testing for generic or follow on drug products that reference adderall xr before they can be approved 
shire believes that these requested criteria will ensure that generic formulations of adderall xr or follow on drug products will be clinically effective and safe 
in january  shire chose to file a supplemental amendment to its original citizen petition  which included additional clinical data in support of the original filing 
the fda has six months to respond to shire s petition and while this petition is under review it will not grant final approval of generic or follow on drug products referencing adderall xr 
on february   an fda advisory committee recommended to the fda that risk information about cardiovascular events be included in a black box warning for all stimulant medicines used to treat adhd 
in making its recommendation  the advisory committee recognized that the reported incidence rates of the rare serious cardiovascular adverse events that were discussed by the committee are generally within the rates that would be expected from the untreated general population 
adderall xr and adderall already include a black box warning in their labels for safety concerns related to amphetamine abuse or misuse and also warn of the risk of sudden death in patients with structural cardiac abnormalities 
shire stands behind the current labeling and believes that further action is unwarranted 
it is too early to tell at the time of filing of this annual report on form k what impact the actions of the fda will have on consumer sentiment in the us adhd market or on adderall xr s us market share 
in january  shire settled its adderall xr patent infringement lawsuits with impax 
the litigations involved shire us patents  nos 
 the patent   the patent and  the patent 
as part of the settlement  impax has confirmed that its proposed generic adderall xr product infringes shire s  and patents and that the three patents are valid and enforceable 
under the terms of the settlement  impax will be permitted to market generic versions of adderall xr in the us no later than january   and will pay shire a royalty from those sales 
in certain situations  such as the launch of another generic version of adderall xr  impax may be permitted to enter the market as shire s authorized generic 
shire s adderall xr patent infringement lawsuits with barr continue 
shire is seeking a ruling that barr s anda seeking permission to market its generic versions of adderall xr infringes the  and patents 
barr s month stay under the hatch waxman act expired on february  following the expiry of the month stay  the fda may approve barr s anda 
a final pre trial conference in the and patent cases is set for march  no trial date has been set 
shire is continuing its discussions with barr in connection with these lawsuits and the discussions are progressing 
for further information see item legal proceedings 
if the company does not prevail in the lawsuits  the company s sales of adderall xr will decrease 
any decrease in the sales of adderall xr would significantly reduce revenues and earnings

fosrenol fosrenol was launched in the us in january product sales for the year to december  were million  with us prescriptions for the year totaling  fosrenol had an share of the total us phosphate binding market in december on november  the fda approved new  higher dose formulations of fosrenol 
new  higher dose strengths of milligrams and milligrams were shipped to wholesalers in the us in december higher dose strengths should help to reduce the number of pills that end stage renal disease patients need to take to achieve target phosphorus levels 
product sales in q were million compared with million in q the variance relates primarily to increased pipeline inventory sales to wholesalers of the new higher dose formulation during december

there is no comparative data for replagal as it was acquired with tkt in july royalties royalty revenue increased to million for the year to december   million primarily as a result of strong sales growth 
year to december  m m change tc zeffix others total tc royalties from sales of tc for the year to december   were million  an increase of compared to million

on april   ortho mcneil neurologics inc janssen s us affiliate company announced that reminyl would be marketed in the us under the new product name of razadyne 
subsequently  in the us  reminyl xl was launched as razadyne er 
ortho mcneil neurologics inc worked closely with the fda on a name change following dispensing errors in the us between reminyl and the type diabetes mellitus drug known as amaryl 
shire is only aware of one similar dispensing error outside the us 
on march   the national institute for health and clinical excellence nice in england and wales issued an appraisal consultation document acd 
this document included a recommendation that all existing approved products for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in england and wales should no longer be reimbursed by the nhs when used in the treatment of new patients 
the recommendation potentially affected sales of reminyl and of reminyl xl in england and wales 
an amended acd was issued by nice on january  the new acd recommends that reminyl and reminyl xl  together with other drugs in the same class  be reimbursed by the nhs when used for the treatment of either i patients with existing alzheimer s disease already being treated with one of these drugs  or ii newly diagnosed patients once their disease has progressed to a moderate stage 
therefore the current recommendation excludes the reimbursement of treatment for patients presenting with mild symptoms of alzheimer s disease for which reminyl and reminyl xl are approved

these formulas  which include yearly threshold sales  were included in an k filed with the sec on october  if vyvanse is classified as schedule ii on approval and then gets favorable scheduling within one year of the first commercial sale  shire will pay new river a million milestone payment  if favorable scheduling occurs by the third anniversary  the milestone payment will be million 
upon favorable scheduling being achieved under each of these scenarios  the profit sharing formula reverts to that applicable to favorable scheduling 
in addition  new river will be entitled to a million milestone payment at the end of the first calendar year in which cumulative worldwide net sales of all collaboration products during that calendar year exceed billion 
a million milestone payment is payable following the first commercial sale in specified european countries 
shire intends to capitalize and amortize any milestone payments over the life of the product 
shire is entitled to terminate the agreement until days following approval of vyvanse 
if shire terminates before regulatory approval  no payment would be due to shire 
if shire terminates after approval and vyvanse has received a favorable scheduling assignment  no payment would be due to shire 
if the approved vyvanse has received a schedule ii classification  shire would be entitled to a million termination payment  payable in cash  new river common stock  or an unsecured  year promissory note  as will be agreed upon by shire and new river 
on february  the company announced that it had agreed to acquire new river for billion in cash 
on completion of the acquisition of new river  shire will terminate these commitments 
for further information see note iii women s health products shire and duramed entered into an agreement related to duramed s transvaginal ring technology that will be applied to at least five women s health products  as well as a license in a number of markets outside of north america  including the larger european markets to duramed s oral contraceptive  seasonique 
this agreement became effective on september  under this agreement  shire will reimburse duramed for us development expenses incurred going forward up to a maximum of million over eight years 
us development expenditure reimbursement for the year ended december   totalled million  with million due for reimbursement at december  at december   the maximum future reimbursement for duramed incurred us development expenditure is therefore million 
shire will separately be responsible for development costs in its licensed territories 
iv tissue protective cytokine tpc development rights in connection with the company s licence of tpc rights in non nervous system indications from warren  the company is committed to making payments on achievement of certain milestones 
the company is not required to make any payments to warren upon regulatory approval of the first product for the first indication 
however  it is obligated to make milestone payments to warren of million upon regulatory approval in up to five subsequent major indications 
v other r d and sales milestones in addition to the commitments set out in i to iv above  at december  the company had commitments payable on achievement of specified milestones and fees payable for products under development in licensed from third parties of million december  million  of which million could be paid in off balance sheet arrangements there are no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
foreign currency fluctuations a number of operating units in the company have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
as such  the consolidated financial results are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates  particularly those between the us dollar  canadian dollar  pound sterling  euro and swedish krona 
the accumulated foreign currency translation differences of million are reported within accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet and a million gain is reported in other income on the consolidated income statement 
as at december   the company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with a total principal amount equivalent to million to manage the currency risk associated with certain inter company loans 
as at december  there were net unrealized losses of million on these contracts 
concentration of credit risk the company s revenues from product sales are mainly derived from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains 
for the year to december  there were three customers in the us who accounted for of the company s total revenues 
however  such clients typically have significant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered minimal 
the company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defined credit evaluation procedures 
financial instruments that potentially expose shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short term cash investments and trade accounts receivable 
excess cash is invested in short term money market instruments  including bank term deposits  money market and liquidity funds and other debt securities from a variety of financial institutions with strong credit ratings 
these investments typically bear minimal risk 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services which are used in the business 
however  the company believes that the net effect of inflation on its operations has been minimal during the past three years 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap and sec regulations  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to provisions for litigation  valuation of intangible assets including those acquired through the acquisition of tkt  inventory acquired through the acquisition of tkt  the valuation of ipr d  the valuation of equity investments  sales deductions  income taxes and share based payments 
and the amount payable to former holders of tkt common stock of approximately million shares who have submitted written demands for appraisal of these shares in relation to the company s acquisition of tkt on july  i litigation the company has a number of lawsuits pending that relate to product liability claims 
shire accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies sfas no 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss 
where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount the minimum amount is recorded 
in other cases management s best estimate of the loss is recorded 
these estimates are developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information becomes known 
best estimates are reviewed quarterly and estimates are changed when expectations are revised 
any outcome upon settlement that deviates from shire s best estimate may result in an additional or lesser expense in a future accounting period 
there were no significant changes in estimates in respect of product liability claim provisions in ii valuation of intangible assets a general the company has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets  recorded at acquisition cost 
as at december   the carrying value of such intangibles was million  which primarily related to the company s daytrana  dynepo  fosrenol  pentasa  reminyl  replagal  solaraze and xagrid products 
those assets which do not yet have a defined revenue stream and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed upon acquisition  and those that do have a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over their estimated useful life 
management s estimate of the useful life considers  inter alia  the following factors the expected use of the asset by the company  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life and the effects of demand  competition  and other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels 
a prolonged general economic downturn  sustained government pressure on prices and  specifically  competitive pricing  could create an imbalance of industry supply and demand  or otherwise diminish volumes or profits 
such events  combined with changes in interest rates  could adversely affect shire s valuation of the estimated future net cash flows generated by its long lived assets 
as a result  future operating results could be materially and adversely affected by impairment charges related to the recoverability of long lived assets 
in the year to december   changes to the estimated future net cash flows from certain products resulted in a million impairment of intangible assets million  million 
in the year to december   the company decreased the estimated life of a product  which resulted in an additional amortization charge of million in the year to december  and million in the year to december the company reviews intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flow approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
b intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of tkt the fair values of all of the identifiable intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of tkt have been determined using an income approach on a project by project basis  by independent valuation specialists 
this method starts with a forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows either generated or saved as a result of ownership of the intellectual property  the customer relationships and the other intangible assets 
these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams 
the forecast of future cash flows requires various assumptions to be made  including revenue that is reasonably likely to result from the sale of products including the estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration and estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles royalty or license fees saved by owning the intellectual property associated with the products cost of sales for the products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data general and administrative expenses research and development expenses the estimated life of the products the tax amortisation benefit available to a market participant purchasing the assets piecemeal the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows 
the company reviews intangible assets for impairment periodically using an undiscounted net cash flow approach whenever events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable 
if the discounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than its carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  based on estimated discounted cash flows 
when cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
iii inventory acquired through the acquisition of tkt inventory acquired through the acquisition of tkt has been fair valued in accordance with sfas no 
as follows finished goods and merchandise at estimated selling prices less the sum of a costs of disposal and b a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquiring entity work in process at estimated selling prices of finished goods less the sum of a costs to complete  b costs of disposal  and c a reasonable profit allowance for the completing and selling effort of the acquiring entity based on profit for similar finished goods the company s management assumed that a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort of the acquiring entity would be of sales proceeds expected at the acquisition date 
this is due to the minimal sales effort required by shire as acquiror to realize sales of the acquired inventory  given the small size of the existing prescription population to whom specialized physicians prescribe replagal  the frequency and duration of treatment required  and low levels of patient switching  together with the low cost and complexity of distribution 
the relevance of this assumption is that it has an impact on the recorded cost of product sales for acquired replagal inventory 
for every one percentage point increase in the profit allowance percentage for the selling effort  our cost of product sales in the year to december  would have reduced by approximately million 
all replagal inventories acquired as part of the tkt acquisition had been consumed by december  the valuation of acquired work in process required the company s management to estimate the level of completion reached at the acquisition date 
this required the exercise of judgment in ascribing value creation to different phases of a complex biological manufacturing process 
the relevance of this estimate is that it has an impact on the recorded cost of product sales for acquired replagal inventory 
for every one percentage point increase in the assumed percentage level of completion  our cost of product sales in the year to december  would have increased by million 
all replagal work in process acquired as part of the tkt acquisition had been consumed by december  the fair value of inventory is based on information at the date of acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with inventory will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual completion costs  disposal costs and proceeds associated with acquired inventory may vary from those forecasted 
as each estimate was made in the context of the conditions that existed at the tkt acquisition date  they are not expected to change from period to period 
iv in process r d write off ipr d is defined by fin as being a development project that has been initiated and achieved material progress but has not yet resulted in a commercially viable product 
as required by fin  the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d of million restated  acquired as part of the tkt transaction  was immediately expensed in the year to december  during the year to december  the company determined that the value ascribed to ipr d acquired as a result of the tkt acquisition did not include the benefit of tax amortization as required by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices  and pharmaceutical industries 
consequently the financial statements for the year to december  have been restated in respect of the value ascribed to ipr d  acquired as part of the tkt acquisition and subsequently written off as required under us gaap in the quarter ended september  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
in the identification of intangible assets  consideration is given to whether any technology that is identified is developed or in process 
the american institute of certified public accountants practice aid assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities a focus on software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries gives guidance on the factors that should be considered when identifying ipr d 
the fair value of ipr d acquired with tkt was determined using the income approach on a project by project basis 
this method is based on the present value of earnings attributable to the asset or costs avoided as a result of owning the assets 
this method includes risk factors  which include applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the project s stage of completion  the nature of the product  the scientific data associated with the technology  the current patent situation and market competition 
the forecast of future cash flows required the following assumptions to be made revenue that is likely to result from specific ipr d projects  including the likelihood of approval of the product  estimated number of units to be sold  estimated selling prices  estimated market penetration  estimated market share and year over year growth rates over the product life cycles cost of sales related to the potential products using historical data  industry data or other sources of market data sales and marketing expense using historical data  industry data or other market data general and administrative expenses r d expenses the tax amortisation benefit available to a market participant purchasing the assets piecemeal the valuations are based on information at the time of the acquisition and the expectations and assumptions that have been deemed reasonable by the company s management 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions or events associated with such assets will occur as projected 
for these reasons  among others  the actual cash flows may vary from forecasts of future cash flows 
v valuation of equity investments the company has investments in certain public and private pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
the carrying values of these investments are periodically reviewed for other than temporary impairments whenever certain events or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of an investment exceeds the fair market value of the investment 
indicators of other than temporary impairments include the market value of a quoted investment being below the carrying value of the investment for an extended period adverse news on a private company s progress in scientific technology development of compounds recent stock issuances at a price below the investment price if the fair value appears to be below the carrying value the company considers all available evidence in assessing whether there is an other than temporary impairment 
this evidence would include the level of progress in the investee s scientific technology development of compounds ongoing activity in collaborations with the investee whether or not other substantial investee specific adverse events have occurred which may cause a decline in value analysis and valuation of comparable companies the overall financial condition of the investee in instances when the review indicates that there is an other than temporary impairment  the company writes down the investment to the fair value of the investment  recording an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
during  shire recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of million million to an investment in a public company 
the determination of the fair value of private company investments and the determination of whether an unrealized loss on a publicly quoted investment is permanent requires significant judgment and can have a material impact on the reported results 
during  shire recorded impairments on long term investments of million million  million 
vi sales deductions sales deductions consist of statutory rebates to state medicaid and other government agencies  contractual rebates with health maintenance organizations hmos  product returns  sales discounts including trade discounts and distribution service fees  wholesaler chargebacks  and allowances for the coupon sampling program 
these deductions are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilization derived from historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
the company accounts for these sales deductions in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  and sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  as applicable 
the company has the following significant categories of sales deductions  all of which involve estimates and judgments which the company considers to be critical accounting estimates  and require the company to use information from external sources medicaid and hmo rebates statutory rebates to state medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to hmos under managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated discounts to the selling price 
medicaid rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product if prices increase faster than inflation 
as it can take up to six months for information to reach the company on actual usage of the company s products in managed care and medicaid programs and on the total discounts to be reimbursed  the company maintains reserves for amounts payable under these programs relating to sold products 
the amount of the reserve is based on historical experience of rebates  the timing of payments  the level of reimbursement claims  changes in prices both normal selling prices and statutory or negotiated prices  changes in prescription demand patterns  and the levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
shire s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel are based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers including data provided by wholesalers as part of the new fee for service agreements see item business manufacturing and distribution material customers for further information and third party prescription data such as ims health national prescription audit data 
revisions or clarification of guidelines from centers for medicare and medicaid services cms related to state medicaid and other government program reimbursement practices with retroactive application can result in changes to management s estimates of the rebates reported in prior periods 
however  since the prices of the company s products are fixed at the time of sale and the quantum of rebates is therefore reasonably determinable at the outset of each transaction  these factors would not impact the recording of revenues in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the accrual estimation process for medicaid and hmo rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and medicaid agency or hmo 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as at the balance sheet date  accruals for medicaid and hmo rebates were million in  million in and million in  or   and  respectively  of net product sales 
product returns the company typically accepts customer product returns in the following circumstances a expiration of shelf life  b product damaged while in the possession of shire  or c under sales terms that allow for unconditional return guaranteed sales 
shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors  including past product returns activity the duration of time taken for products to be returned the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel product recalls and discontinuances the shelf life of products the launch of new drugs or new formulations the loss of patent protection or new competition shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers  third party prescription data and  for some product return provisions  market research of retail pharmacies 
returns for new products are more difficult for the company to estimate than for established products 
for shipments made to support the commercial launch of a new product which are typically guaranteed sales  the company cannot reliably estimate expected returns  and the company s policy is therefore to defer recognition of the sales revenue until there is evidence of end patient acceptance primarily third party prescription data  in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition 
for shipments after launch under standard terms ie not guaranteed sales  the company s initial estimates of sales return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales returns experience of similar products shortly after launch 
once sufficient historical data on actual returns of the product are available  the returns provision is based on this data and any other relevant factors as noted above 
the accrual estimation process for product returns involves in each case a number of interrelating assumptions  which vary for each combination of product and customer 
accordingly  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or uncertainty 
however  shire does not believe that the effect of uncertainties  as a whole  significantly impacts the company s financial condition or results of operations 
as at the balance sheet date  provisions for product returns were million in  million in and million in  or  and  respectively  of net product sales 
sales coupon accrual for certain products  primarily adderall xr and daytrana  the company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive 
these coupons reimburse part or all of the cost of the first prescription 
each coupon can only be used once and coupons typically expire three to months after the date of issuance 
the company s management calculates an accrual for the estimated value of coupons that will be redeemed against sold products  based on the rebate value per coupon  the timing and volume of coupon distributions  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel and expected coupon redemption rates  using historical trends and experience 
shire s estimate of the level of inventory in the distribution channel is based on product by product inventory data provided by wholesalers and third party prescription data 
shire believes that historical redemption rates  adjusted for known changes in coupon programs such as length of coupon life and redemption conditions are an appropriate basis for predicting future redemption rates 
for coupon programs open at december  the redemption rates assumed by shire range between and of coupons distributed depending on the life of the coupons 
a one percentage point increase in estimated coupon redemption rates would increase the provision at december  by million 
at december  the accrual for coupon redemptions was million million  million 
the accrual levels in each year fluctuate according to the timing and volume of coupon distributions  in addition to changes in estimated redemption rates 
for rebates  returns and sales coupons the actual experience and the level of these deductions to revenue may deviate from the estimate 
shire reviews its estimates every quarter and may be required to adjust the estimate in a subsequent period 
historically  actual payments have not varied significantly from the reserves provided 
vii income taxes shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax authorities 
because shire operates globally  the nature of the audit items is often very complex and subject to change and the amounts at issue can be substantial 
the company uses internal expertise and professional advisors to minimize audit adjustments where possible 
shire develops best estimates of income taxes payable for probable liabilities using experience  judgment and assistance from professional advisors 
estimates are refined as additional information becomes known 
any outcome upon settlement that differs from shire s best estimate may result in additional or lower tax expense in future periods 
income taxes payable increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of additional tax contingencies recognized in relation to ongoing tax audits 
the company has significant deferred tax assets due to net operating losses nols in the united states  uk and other countries 
the realization of these assets is not assured and is dependent on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the future 
management has exercised judgment in determining the extent of the realization of these losses based upon estimates of future taxable income in the various jurisdictions in which these nols exist 
where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities there will not be sufficient taxable profits to utilize these nols a valuation allowance is held against these deferred tax assets 
if actual events differ from management s estimates  or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted in the future  any changes to the valuation allowance could materially impact the company s financial position and results 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
at december   the company had gross deferred tax assets of million and had recorded a valuation allowance of million against this amount 
viii share based payments shire plc has historically granted options to the company s directors and employees over ordinary shares under six stock option plans 
on november  the ordinary shareholders of shire plc approved the adoption of the shire plc portfolio share plan parts a and b  a new share based compensation plan  which provides for stock settled share appreciation rights and performance share awards to be made to the directors and employees over ordinary shares and american depositary shares 
further details on these plans can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in the part iv of this annual report 
effective january  the company adopted the provisions of sfas r which establishes accounting for share based compensation for employees 
the company measures share based compensation cost for awards classified as equity at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and recognizes the cost as an expense on a straight line basis net of estimated forfeitures over the employee requisite service period 
the company measures share based compensation cost for awards classified as liabilities at fair value  which is re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the company estimates the fair value of share based awards without market based performance conditions using a black scholes valuation model and awards with market based performance conditions are valued using a binomial valuation model 
several critical assumptions are made in the determination of the company s share based compensation cost 
the company believes that the most critical assumptions are the expected life of the award and the weighted average volatility of the company s stock 
other assumptions made by the company in respect of the determination of share based compensation cost include the risk free rate  the expected dividend yield and the expected forfeiture rate 
the company s estimate of the expected life of the award is based on historical trends of employee exercise behaviour 
the company reviews these trends at the time of each new grant for equity classified awards  and at the end of each reporting period for liability classified awards  to ensure that the estimated life of the award is consistent with historical exercise behaviour 
the weighted average volatility is based upon historical share price data of the company s stock for the requisite expected life of the awards 
given the related nature of each of the assumptions underlying the valuation of share based payment awards  it would not be meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for each individual assumption 
the company believes that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in estimating the fair values of shire s stock based awards 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards  and subsequent events are not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the company under sfas r 
recent accounting pronouncements update see note y to the consolidated financial statements contained in the part iv of this annual report for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and effects on financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk treasury policies and organization the company s principal treasury operations are coordinated by its corporate treasury function  which is based in the uk 
all treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved by the board 
as a matter of policy  the company does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure 
the board reviews and agrees policies for managing the risks in the following areas interest rate risk as at december  the company had no material debt outstanding 
therefore  the company s interest charge on its debt obligations is low and consequently the company s interest expense charge has limited exposure to interest rate movements 
the company is exposed to movements in interest rates affecting interest income 
this exposure is primarily to us dollar interest rates 
as the company maintains all of its investments on a short term basis for liquidity purposes this risk is not actively managed 
in the year to december  the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was approximately per annum 
the largest proportion of investments was in us dollar money market and liquidity funds 
the acquisition of new river will change the financial profile of the company and will increase interest rate exposure  still primarily to us dollar interest rates 
the company s treasury committee will review the impact of the change and implement an appropriate policy to manage this risk 
foreign exchange risk the company is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar for trading transactions and the translation of net assets  liabilities and earnings of non us subsidiaries 
the main trading currencies of the company are the us dollar  the canadian dollar  pounds sterling  the euro and swedish krona 
the consolidated financial statements of foreign entities are translated using the accounting policies described in note a to the company s consolidated financial statements contained in part iv of this annual report 
the exposure to foreign exchange risk is managed and monitored by the treasury function 
exposures are generally managed through natural hedging via the currency denomination of cash balances 
as at december  the company had outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts with a total principal amount of million equivalent to manage the currency risk associated with certain inter company loans 
as at december  there were net unrealized losses of million on these contracts 
market risk of investments as at december  the company has million of investments comprising equity investment funds million  private companies million and publicly quoted equities million 
the investment in public quoted companies and equity investment funds are exposed to market risk 
no financial instruments or derivatives have been employed to hedge this risk
