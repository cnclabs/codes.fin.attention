our company we are a leading manufacturer of specialty and fine chemicals within our focused markets 
our specialty chemicals and aerospace equipment products are utilized in national defense programs and provide access to  and movement in  space  via solid propellant rockets and propulsion thrusters 
our fine chemicals products represent the key active ingredient in certain anti viral  oncology and central nervous system drug applications 
our technical and manufacturing expertise and customer service focus has gained us a reputation for quality  reliability  technical performance and innovation 
given the mission critical nature of our products  we maintain long standing strategic customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop customized solutions that meet rigorous federal regulatory standards 
we generally sell our products through long term contracts under which we are the sole source or dual source supplier 
we are the exclusive north american provider of grade i ammonium perchlorate ap  which is the predominant oxidizing agent for solid propellant rockets  booster motors and missiles used in space exploration  commercial satellite transportation and national defense programs 
in order to diversify our business and leverage our strong technical and manufacturing capabilities  we have made two strategic acquisitions in recent years 
each of these acquisitions provided long term customer relationships with sole source and dual source contracts and leadership positions in growing markets 
on october   we acquired aerojet general corporation s in space propulsion business  which is now our aerospace equipment segment 
our aerospace equipment segment is one of only two north american manufacturers of in space liquid propulsion systems and propellant tanks 
on november   we acquired the fine chemicals business of gencorp inc gencorp  which is now our fine chemicals segment 
our fine chemicals segment is a leading manufacturer of certain active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and registered intermediates for pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
our business segments our operations comprise four reportable business segments i specialty chemicals  ii fine chemicals  iii aerospace equipment and iv other businesses 
the following table reflects the revenue contribution percentage from our business segments and each of their major product lines for the years ended september specialty chemicals perchlorates sodium azide halotron total specialty chemicals fine chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses real estate water treatment equipment total other businesses total revenues specialty chemicals 
our specialty chemicals segment is principally engaged in the production of grade i ammonium perchlorate 
perchlorates represented of the segment s revenues for fiscal in addition  we produce and sell sodium azide  a chemical used in pharmaceutical manufacturing  and halotron  a chemical used in fire extinguishing systems ranging from portable fire extinguishers to airport firefighting vehicles 
we have supplied ap for use in space and defense programs for over years and have been the exclusive ap supplier in north america since a significant number of existing and planned space launch vehicles use solid propellant and thus depend  in part  upon our ap 
many of the rockets and missiles used in national defense programs are also powered by solid propellants 
currently  our largest programs are the minuteman missile  the standard missile and the atlas family of commercial rockets 
alliant techsystems  inc or atk is our largest ap customer 
we sell grade i ap to atk under a long term contract that requires us to maintain a ready and qualified capacity for grade i ap and that requires atk to purchase its grade i ap requirements from us  subject to certain terms and conditions 
the contract  which expires in  provides fixed pricing in the form of a price volume matrix for annual grade i ap volumes ranging from million to million pounds 
prices vary inversely to volume and include annual escalations 
fine chemicals 
on november   we acquired the fine chemicals business of gencorp the afc business through our newly formed  wholly owned subsidiary ampac fine chemicals llc or afc 
our fine chemicals segment is a manufacturer of active pharmaceutical ingredients apis and registered intermediates 
the pharmaceutical ingredients that we manufacture are used by our customers in drugs with applications in three primary areas anti viral  oncology  and central nervous system 
we generate nearly all of our fine chemicals sales from manufacturing chemical compounds that are proprietary to our customers 
we operate in compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practices or cgmp 
our fine chemicals segment s strategy is to focus on high growth markets where our technology position  combined with our chemical process and development and engineering expertise  leads to strong customer allegiances and limited competition 
we have distinctive competencies and specialized engineering capabilities in performing chiral separations  and manufacturing highly potent cytotoxic and energetic compounds and nucleosides 
we have invested significant resources in our facilities and technology base 
we believe we are the us leader in performing chiral separations using the first commercial scale simulated moving bed smb technology in the us and own and operate two large scale smb machines  both of which are among the largest in the world operating under cgmp 
we have distinctive competency in handling energetic and toxic chemicals using our specialized high containment facilities in applications such as drugs used for oncology 
we have significant experience and specially engineered facilities for energetic chemistry on a commercial scale under cgmp 
we use this capability in development and production of anti viral drugs  including hiv related and influenza combating drugs 
we have established long term  sole source and dual source contracts 
in addition  the inherent nature of custom pharmaceutical fine chemical manufacturing encourages long term customer relationships 
we work collaboratively with our customers to develop reliable  safe and cost effective  custom solutions 
once a customer establishes a production process with us  there are several potential barriers that discourage transferring the manufacturing method to an alternative supplier  including the following alternative supply may not be readily available we are currently the sole source supplier on several of our fine chemicals products 
regulatory approval applications to and approvals from the fda and other regulatory authorities generally require the chemical contractor to be named 
switching contractors may require additional regulatory approval and could take as long as years 
significant financial costs switching contractors can result in significant costs associated with technology transfer  process validation and re filing with the fda and other regulatory authorities 
aerospace equipment 
on october   we acquired aerojet general corporation s in space propulsion business 
our aerospace equipment segment is one of two north american manufacturers of monopropellant or bipropellant propulsion systems and thrusters for satellites and launch vehicles  and is one of the world s major producers of bipropellant thrusters for satellites 
our products are utilized on various satellite and launch vehicle programs such as space systems loral s series geostationary satellites 
the aerospace equipment market is expected to grow over the next several years 
growth areas include missile defense programs and the commercial satellite segment  which is expecting steady growth over the next four years as a result of broadband  hdtv and communications applications 
other businesses 
our other businesses business segment includes the production of water treatment equipment  including equipment for odor control and disinfection of water  and real estate operations 
in fiscal  we completed the sale of all real estate assets that were targeted for sale and do not anticipate significant real estate sales activity in the future 
discontinued operations 
we also held a ownership stake in energetic systems  inc esi  an entity we consolidated under financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  that manufactures and distributes commercial explosives 
in june  our board of directors approved  and we committed to  a plan to sell esi  based on our determination that esi s product lines were no longer a strategic fit with our business strategies 
revenues and expenses associated with esi s operations are presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
esi was formerly reported within our specialty chemicals segment 
effective september   we completed the sale of our interest in esi for  which  after deducting direct expenses  resulted in a gain on the sale before income taxes of results of operations revenues year ended september  percentage change vs

specialty chemicals fine chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total revenues specialty chemicals 
specialty chemicals segment revenues include revenues from our perchlorate  sodium azide and halotron product lines  with perchlorates comprising  and of specialty chemicals revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the year over year variances in specialty chemicals revenues reflect the following factors a increase in grade i ap volume in fiscal and a increase in the related average price per pound 
a decline in grade i ap volume in fiscal and a increase in the related average price per pound 
sodium azide revenues decreased in fiscal and increased in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
halotron revenues increased in fiscal and in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in grade i ap volume in fiscal is generally distributed equally among the various solid rocket motor propulsion programs for which we supply ap 
there are numerous variations of grade i ap that we produce for our customers 
the average price per pound of grade i ap sold in fiscal increased compared to fiscal because a greater percentage of the volume related to specialized blends of grade i ap which are sold at higher unit prices than others 
we expect grade i ap demand in fiscal to be consistent with fiscal over the longer term  we expect demand for grade i ap to be within the ranges of fiscal and in addition  grade i ap revenues are typically derived from a relatively few large orders 
as a result  quarterly revenue amounts can vary significantly depending on the timing of individual orders throughout the year 
average price per pound may continue to fluctuate somewhat in future periods  depending upon product mix and volume 
the increase in sodium azide revenues in fiscal and subsequent decrease in fiscal is due to additional volume in fiscal of sodium azide used in a pharmaceutical application 
demand for sodium azide in this application increased in fiscal consistent with our customer s production which ramped up to support demand for stockpiling of the end product by our customer s customer 
we do not see an increase in demand for sodium azide in the foreseeable future 
increases in halotron revenues are driven by volume changes which have been and are expected to be consistent year over year 
fine chemicals 
we acquired our fine chemicals segment on november   two months after the beginning of our fiscal year 
fine chemicals segment revenues increased  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year 
on a pro forma basis  assuming the acquisition was effective october   fine chemicals segment revenues increased from pro forma revenues of  in fiscal to  in fiscal  representing organic growth 
overall  the pro forma fine chemicals segment revenue growth is driven primarily by additional volumes for our anti viral products almost entirely in the hiv related area 
as is typical with the segment  the overall net growth reflects increases during the year for several products and decreases for other products 
this occurs as a function of our customers ordering cycles and our timing of the production cycle 
production cycles are determined based on customer delivery requirements and the most effective use of afc s facilities 
we expect that our fine chemicals segment will achieve similar levels of organic growth in fiscal in addition  we believe that market conditions  which include a trend of outsourced manufacturing by large pharma companies  support our growth trends beyond fiscal longer term growth will require capacity expansion  which we believe can be achieved through various alternatives including  capital expenditures  niche acquisitions or outsourcing of certain steps within our production processes 
aerospace equipment 
aerospace equipment revenues for fiscal were consistent with the prior year 
the fiscal revenues reflect several months of lower volume related to the timing of orders from isp s largest customer 
with respect to this customer  isp completed production under a multi year contract in may production on a follow on order began in august as a result  revenues in fiscal were reduced by the lag time between orders 
conversely  revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased compared to the prior year quarter reflecting production associated with the aforementioned order 
during fiscal  our aerospace equipment segment spent substantial bid and proposal costs and efforts for the nasa clv program and continued our push into propulsion systems 
our efforts bidding propulsion systems are anticipated not only to affect future commercial programs but also military programs  one of which we are under contract for the first phase and in consideration with respect to the second phase 
we expect that our aerospace equipment segment may return to a double digit revenue growth trend in fiscal aerospace equipment segment revenues increased  for fiscal compared to the prior year due to an increase in its sales volume resulting from success in new contract awards for both commercial and government satellite applications 
other businesses 
other businesses segment revenues include pepcon systems water treatment equipment sales and real estate revenues 
the year over year variances in other businesses revenues reflect the following factors water treatment equipment sales increased  in fiscal and  in fiscal  each compared to the prior fiscal years 
the revenue increases were driven by new system sales 
fiscal included a significant real estate sale of  there were no significant real estate sales in fiscal or and we do not expect significant real estate sales in the future 
cost of revenues and gross margin year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
revenues cost of revenues gross margin gross margin percentage fiscal cost of revenues increased  or  to  from  for the prior year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage improved to compared to for the prior year 
one of the most significant factors that affects  and should continue to affect  the comparison of our consolidated gross margins from period to period is the change in product mix between our two largest segments 
our specialty chemicals segment typically has higher gross margins than our fine chemicals segment 
measured in terms of revenues  specialty chemicals accounted for  and of our operations during fiscal  and  respectively 
fine chemicals has grown as a percentage of total revenues  comprising  and of consolidated revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the following factors affect our fiscal consolidated gross margin comparisons specialty chemicals segment gross margin percentage improved approximately four points for the fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily because the higher volumes and average selling price per pound in fiscal resulted in improved coverage of fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
fine chemicals segment gross margin percentage for the fiscal improved two points compared to the prior year because of a change in product mix and the effect of several continuous improvement projects 
we expect that the fine chemicals segment gross margins percentage may depress slightly in fiscal as the business continues to grow and diversify 
aerospace equipment segment gross margin percentage improved approximately five points for fiscal compared to the prior year largely due to fiscal activity including more standard production thruster work compared to the prior fiscal year which included a greater volume of development activities 
cost of revenues increased  or  during fiscal from fiscal primarily due to the related increase in revenues 
the gross margin percentage declined to in fiscal compared to fiscal based on the following gross margin percentage for our specialty chemicals and aerospace equipment segments improved four points and seven points  respectively  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to more favorable pricing of specialty chemicals products and better manufacturing overhead absorption for our aerospace equipment segment 
while afc contributes significant gross profit  its gross margin percentage is less than that of our specialty chemicals segment 
thus  the effect of including afc in fiscal is a reduction in the consolidated gross margin percentage due to the change in product mix 
gross margin from our other businesses segment declined in fiscal fiscal includes a significant real estate sale which contributed approximately two margin points to the prior year consolidated gross margin percentage 
operating expenses year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
operating expenses percentage of revenues operating expenses increased  in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily attributed to a net increase in fine chemicals operating expenses of  primarily because fiscal included twelve months of operations compared to ten months of operations in the prior fiscal year 
a decrease of  in amortization expense related to afc intangible assets 
an increase of  for incentive compensation at our specialty chemicals segment and corporate operations due to improved performance in fiscal an increase of due to sarbanes oxley compliance costs and related additional audit fees 
a decrease of in corporate severance costs 
in fiscal we recorded a charge for related to a settlement with the company s former chief financial officer 
operating expenses increased  in fiscal compared to the prior year primarily due to the inclusion of afc beginning november  in addition  fiscal operating expenses were affected by higher legal fees associated with the renegotiation of our contract with atk 
a charge for recorded in fiscal related to a settlement with our former chief financial officer see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report environmental remediation charges during our fiscal third quarter  we recorded a charge for  representing our estimate of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at our former manufacturing facility in henderson  nevada the ampac henderson site  including the costs for equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and consultants 
key factors in determining the total estimated cost include an estimate of the speed of groundwater entering the treatment area  which was then used to estimate a project life of years  as well as estimates for capital expenditures and annual operating and maintenance costs 
the project consists of two primary phases  the initial construction of the remediation equipment and the operating and maintenance phase 
during fiscal  we increased our total cost estimate of probable costs for the construction phase by  due primarily to changes in the engineering designs  delays in receiving permits and the resulting extension of construction time 
we commenced the construction phase in late fiscal  completed an interim system in june  and completed the permanent facility in december in addition  to the operating and maintenance costs  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
these estimates are based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate

specialty chemicals fine chemicals aerospace equipment other businesses total segment operating profit corporate expenses environmental remediation charges operating income loss segment operating profit includes all sales and expenses directly associated with each segment 
environmental remediation charges  corporate general and administrative costs and interest are not allocated to segment operating results 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
fluctuations in segment operating profit are driven by changes in segment revenues  gross margins and operating expenses  each of which is discussed in greater detail above 
during fiscal  we revised our method to measure segment operating results to a method management believes is a more meaningful measure of segment performance 
effective january   general corporate expenses are not allocated to our operating segments 
effective april   environmental remediation charges are not allocated to our operating segments 
other environmental related costs  such as evaluation and on going compliance at our various facilities continue to be allocated to segment results 
prior to these effective dates  we had included an allocation of corporate expenses to our operating segments and environmental remediation charges were allocated to our specialty chemicals segment 
all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect our current method to measure segment operating results 
interest and debt repayment charges year ended september  percentage change vs 
vs 
interest and other income interest income real estate partnership income other income total interest expense debt repayment charges we earn interest income on our cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income varies with these balances 
we owned a interest as general and limited partner in gibson business park associates i the partnership  a real estate development limited partnership 
the remaining limited partners include certain current and former members of our board of directors 
the partnership  in turn  owned a limited partner interest in hughes parkway associates limited partnership  a nevada limited partnership hughes parkway 
hughes parkway owns the building in which we lease office space in las vegas  nevada 
during fiscal  we received a cash distribution of from the partnership which is recorded as other income 
in october  the partnership sold its interest in hughes parkway  which resulted in a net gain and cash distribution to us of  concurrent with  and as a condition of  the sale of the partnership s interest in hughes parkway  we renewed our office space lease through february we accounted for the transaction as a sale leaseback 
accordingly  we deferred a gain totaling  representing the present value of future lease payments 
we amortize the deferred gain as a reduction of rental expense  using the straight line method over the term of the lease 
we recognized the remaining gain of  which is reported in interest and other income for fiscal interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily because our long term debt  which was issued in connection with the acquisition of our fine chemicals segment  was outstanding for months in fiscal compared to months in fiscal this increase in interest expense was partially offset by our refinancing activities in february which reduced the average interest rate on our long term debt to 
prior to our refinancing  our variable rate long term debt had a weighted average interest rate of as of december  debt repayment charges are associated with the aforementioned refinancing activities which are discussed in further detail below under the heading long term debt and revolving credit facilities 
income taxes our income tax expense benefit rate differs from the federal statutory rate due to state income taxes  amounts that were expensed for book purposes that are not deductible for income tax purposes  changes in our valuation allowances  and other adjustments to our estimates of tax liabilities 
a reconciliation of the federal statutory rate to our effective tax benefit rate is as follows for the years ended september federal income tax at the statutory rate state income tax  net of federal benefit nondeductible expenses valuation allowance change in effective state income tax rate basis differences in partnerships other effective tax rate as of september  and  respectively  we have aggregate operating loss carryforwards of  and  for certain us states and  and  for the united kingdom uk we do not anticipate future taxable income in these states or the uk  and accordingly have provided valuation allowances of and as of september  and  respectively 
we have not provided a us federal income tax benefit for the uk because we intend to permanently reinvest any earnings from the uk extraordinary gain in october  we acquired isp 
the fair value of the current assets acquired and current liabilities assumed exceeded the purchase price 
accordingly  non current assets were recorded at zero  and an extraordinary gain of  net of approximately income tax expense was recorded based on the excess fair value of net assets over the purchase price 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows vs 
vs 
cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities net change in cash for period operating activities 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash flows from operating activities improved by  significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include an increase in cash due to improved profitability of our operations of  an increase in cash used to fund working capital increases of  excluding the effect of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash taxes paid of  an increase in cash used for interest payments of  including payments totaling for the early payment and termination of our second lien credit facility in february described below in long term debt and revolving credit facilities 
a reduction in cash used for environmental remediation of  other increases in cash used for operating activities of  cash used to fund working capital increases was generally consistent between fiscal and fiscal during fiscal  an increase in cash used to fund inventory increases of  was offset by cash provided by decreases in accounts receivable balances 
we expect that our working capital may vary normally by as much as  from quarter to quarter 
payments of cash taxes increased primarily due to state income taxes in california and new york 
we currently do not have federal taxable income due to the effect of accelerated depreciation methods 
cash used for interest increased primarily due to the change in our debt structure discussed below 
in fiscal  a significant portion of our debt included payment in kind or pik interest which effectively increased outstanding principal amounts without making cash payments for interest 
conversely  in fiscal  our senior notes as defined under long term debt and revolving credit facilities below required cash interest payments semi annually 
cash used for environmental remediation decreased because during fiscal we were in the construction phase of the project compared to the lower cash requirements of the operating and maintenance phase which began in fiscal fiscal year compared to fiscal year cash flows from operating activities decreased by  significant components of the change in cash flow from operating activities include an increase in cash due to improved profitability of our operations of  an increase in cash used to fund working capital increases of  excluding the effect of interest and income taxes 
an increase in cash used for interest payments of  an increase in cash provided by tax refunds of an increase in cash used for environmental remediation of  other increases in cash provided by operating activities of the increased cash used to fund working capital growth relates primarily to post acquisition increases in afc accounts receivable and inventories 
these increases are considered normal fluctuations consistent with the growth in the fine chemicals segment 
cash used for interest payments related to debt instruments used to fund the afc acquisition 
environmental remediation payments increased in fiscal because fiscal was the first full year of this activity 
in addition  fiscal remediation activities were associated with the capital phase of the project which had higher cash requirements 
investing activities 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year significant components of cash flows from investing activities include fiscal includes cash received from the sale of esi of  and cash used to fund the afc acquisition earnout adjustment of  see notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
fiscal includes cash used for our acquisition of afc of  and cash provided by proceeds from the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership of  see notes and  respectively  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
capital expenditures for fiscal decreased to  compared to  for fiscal capital expenditures decreased in fiscal because during the prior year we were actively involved in the construction of the new smb facility at afc 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year significant components of cash flows from investing activities include fiscal includes cash used for our acquisition of afc of  and cash provided by proceeds from the sale of our interest in a real estate partnership of  fiscal includes cash used for our acquisition of isp of  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
capital expenditures for fiscal increased to  compared to  for fiscal capital expenditures increased in fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of afc which was actively involved in the construction of its smb facility 
prior to fiscal  our capital expenditures relate primarily to our specialty chemicals segment  which typically has low capital expenditure requirements 
financing activities 
financing cash flows for fiscal and are primarily related to the credit facilities we secured in connection with our acquisition of afc in november  and the subsequent repayment of these facilities and issuance of the senior notes in february these financing instruments are discussed in further detail under the heading long term debt and revolving credit facilities below 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash of  our primary source of working capital is cash flow from our operations and our revolving credit line which had availability of approximately  as of september  availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
in addition  we may incur additional debt to fund capital projects  strategic initiatives or for other general corporate purposes  subject to our existing leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing limitations imposed by our lenders 
the availability of our cash inflows is affected by the timing  pricing and magnitude of orders for our products 
from time to time  we may explore options to refinance our borrowings 
the timing of our cash outflows is affected by payments and expenses related to the manufacture of our products  capital projects  interest on our debt obligations and environmental remediation or other contingencies  which may place demands on our short term liquidity 
although we are not currently party to any material pending legal proceedings  we have incurred legal and other costs as a result of other contingencies and litigation in the past  and we may incur material legal and other costs associated with the resolution of litigation and contingencies in future periods 
if such costs are material  to the extent not covered by insurance  they would adversely affect our liquidity 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations  existing cash balances and existing or future debt arrangements will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations on both a short term and long term basis 
long term debt and revolving credit facilities senior notes 
in february  we issued and sold  aggregate principal amount of senior notes due february  collectively  with the exchange notes issued in august  the senior notes 
proceeds from the issuance of the senior notes were used to repay our credit facilities  discussed below 
the senior notes accrue interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually in february and august 
the senior notes are guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by all of our existing and future material us subsidiaries 
the senior notes are ranked equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future senior indebtedness  ranked senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior subordinated and subordinated indebtedness  effectively junior to our existing and future secured debt to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt  and structurally subordinated to all of the existing and future liabilities including trade payables of each of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes 
the senior notes may be redeemed  in whole or in part  under the following circumstances at any time prior to february  at a price equal to of the purchase amount of the senior notes plus an applicable premium as defined in the related indenture  at any time on or after february  at redemption prices beginning at and reducing to by february   until february   up to of the principal amount of the senior notes at a redemption price of with the proceeds of certain sales of its equity securities  and under certain changes of control  we must offer to purchase the senior notes at of their aggregate principal amount  plus accrued interest 
the senior notes were issued pursuant to an indenture  which contains certain customary events of default and certain other covenants limiting  subject to exceptions  carve outs and qualifications  our ability to incur additional debt  pay dividends or make other restricted payments  create liens on assets to secure debt  incur dividend or other payment restrictions with regard to restricted subsidiaries  transfer or sell assets  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  create an unrestricted subsidiary  enter into certain business activities  or effect a consolidation  merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in connection with the closing of the sale of the senior notes  we entered into a registration rights agreement which required us to file a registration statement to offer to exchange the senior notes for notes that have substantially identical terms as the senior notes and are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
in july  we filed a registration statement with the sec with respect to an offer to exchange the senior notes as required by the registration rights agreement  which was declared effective by the sec 
in august  we completed the exchange of of the senior notes for substantially identical notes which are registered under the securities act of  as amended 
credit facilities 
in connection with our acquisition of the afc business  discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  on november   we entered into a  first lien credit agreement the first lien credit facility with wachovia bank  national association and other lenders 
we also entered into a  second lien credit agreement the second lien credit facility  and together with the first lien credit facility  the credit facilities with wachovia bank  national association  and certain other lenders 
the credit facilities were collateralized by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiaries 
concurrent with the issuance of our senior notes in february  we repaid our first lien term loan  amended our first lien credit facility and repaid and terminated our second lien credit facility 
the amendment to the first lien credit facility resulted in our revolving credit facility  described below 
revolving credit facility 
on february   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement the revolving credit facility with wachovia bank  national association  and certain other lenders  which provides a secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity in years 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
the annual interest rates applicable to loans under the revolving credit facility are  at our option  either the alternate base rate or libor rate each as defined in the revolving credit facility plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is tied to our total leverage ratio as defined in the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we will pay commitment fees  other fees related to the issuance and maintenance of letters of credit  and certain agency fees 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by and secured by substantially all of the assets of our current and future domestic subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains certain negative covenants restricting and limiting our ability to  among other things incur debt  incur contingent obligations and issue certain types of preferred stock  create liens  pay dividends  distributions or make other specified restricted payments  make certain investments and acquisitions  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  and merge or consolidate with any other entity or sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of assets 
financial covenants under the revolving credit facility include quarterly requirements for total leverage ratio of less than or equal to to  and interest coverage ratio of at least to 
the revolving credit facility also contains usual and customary events of default subject to certain threshold amounts and grace periods 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  we may be required to repay the obligations under the revolving credit facility prior to its stated maturity and the related commitments may be terminated 
as of september   under our revolving credit facility  we had no borrowings outstanding  availability of  and we were in compliance with its various financial covenants 
availability is computed as the total commitment of  less outstanding borrowings and outstanding letters of credit  if any 
seller subordinated note 
in connection with our acquisition of the afc business  discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  we issued an unsecured subordinated seller note the seller subordinated note in the principal amount of  to aerojet general corporation  a subsidiary of gencorp 
the seller subordinated note accrued payment in kind interest at a rate equal to the three month us dollar libor as from time to time in effect plus a margin equal to the weighted average of the interest rate margin for the loans outstanding under the credit facilities  including certain changes in interest rates due to subsequent amendments or refinancing of the credit facilities 
the seller subordinated note was subordinated to the senior debt under or related to the credit facilities and certain other indebtedness  subject to certain terms and conditions 
in connection with our february refinancing activities  we negotiated an early retirement of the seller subordinated note at a discount of approximately  from its face amount 
on february   we paid aerojet  representing full settlement of the seller subordinated note and accrued interest 
debt issue costs and debt repayment charges 
in connection with the repayment of our credit facilities  we recorded a charge for approximately  to write off the unamortized balance of debt issue costs associated with those facilities 
in addition  we paid a pre payment penalty of to terminate of the second lien credit facility 
these charges are presented as debt repayment charges in our statement of operations 
in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we incurred debt issuance costs of approximately  which were capitalized and classified as other assets on the balance sheet 
these costs will be amortized as additional interest expense over the eight year term on the senior notes 
interest rate swap agreements in may  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  to have expired on june   for the purpose of hedging a portion of our exposure to changes in variable rate interest on our credit facilities 
under the terms of the swap agreements  we paid fixed rate interest and received variable rate interest based on a specific spread over three month libor 
the differential to be paid or received was recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the swap agreements did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
we recorded an asset or liability for the fair value of the swap agreements  with the effect of marking these contracts to fair value being recorded as an adjustment to interest expense 
the aggregate fair value of the swap agreements at september   which was recorded as other long term liabilities  was in connection with the refinancing of our credit facilities  we terminated our swap agreements at a cost of  which resulted in a gain of that is recorded as a reduction of interest expense in fiscal environmental remediation ampac henderson site during our fiscal third quarter  we recorded a charge for  representing our estimate of the probable costs of our remediation efforts at the ampac henderson site  including the costs for equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and consultants 
key factors in determining the total estimated cost include an estimate of the speed of groundwater entering the treatment area  which was then used to estimate a project life of years  as well as estimates for capital expenditures and annual operating and maintenance costs 
the project consists of two primary phases  the initial construction of the remediation equipment and the operating and maintenance phase 
during our fiscal  we increased our total cost estimate of probable costs for the construction phase by  due primarily to changes in the engineering designs  delays in receiving permits and the resulting extension of construction time 
we commenced the construction phase in late fiscal  completed an interim system in june  and completed the permanent facility in december in addition  to the operating and maintenance costs  certain remediation activities are conducted on public lands under operating permits 
in general  these permits require us to return the land to its original condition at the end of the permit period 
estimated costs associated with removal of remediation equipment from the land are not material and are included in our range of estimated costs 
these estimates are based on information currently available to us and may be subject to material adjustment upward or downward in future periods as new facts or circumstances may indicate 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our fiscal year contractual obligations and commitments as of september  payments due by year ending september  thereafter total senior notes interest on senior notes at annually capital leases interest on capital leases operating leases purchase commitments total in addition to the contractual obligations listed in the table above  at september   we have recorded an estimated liability for environmental remediation of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and aggregate defined benefit pension plan and supplemental executive retirement plan serp obligations of  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we expect to spend approximately for environmental remediation during fiscal we expect to contribute  to our defined benefit pension plans and serp during fiscal we also maintain the revolving credit facility  which provides revolving credit in an aggregate principal amount of up to  with an initial maturity in february at september   we had no balance outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we may prepay and terminate the revolving credit facility at any time 
off balance sheet arrangements letters of credit 
as of september   we had  in outstanding standby letters of credit which mature through may these letters of credit principally secure performance of certain environmental protection equipment sold by us and payment of fees associated with the delivery of natural gas and power 
employee agreements 
we have employment agreements in effect with our chief executive officer and chief operating officer 
the terms of these agreements end on december  and september   respectively  unless amended or extended either in accordance with the terms of each such agreement or otherwise 
significant contract provisions include annual base salaries  health care benefits  and non compete provisions 
these contracts are primarily at will employment agreements  under which we may terminate employment 
if we terminate these officers without cause  then we are obligated to pay severance benefits specified in the contracts 
in addition  certain other key divisional executives are eligible for severance benefits 
estimated minimum aggregate severance benefits under these agreements are  we do not have any other material off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation general inflation did not have a material or significant effect on our sales and operating revenues or costs during the three year period ended september  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america requires that we adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
application of the critical accounting policies discussed below requires significant judgments  often as the result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ materially from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
however  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results 
sales and revenue recognition revenues for our specialty chemicals segment  fine chemicals segment  and water treatment equipment are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has been made  title passes  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
almost all products sold by our fine chemicals segment are subject to customer acceptance periods 
we record deferred revenues upon shipment of the product and recognize these revenues in the period when the acceptance period lapses or customer s acceptance has occurred 
some of our perchlorate and fine chemical products customers have requested that we store materials purchased from us in our facilities 
we recognize revenue prior to shipment of these bill and hold transactions when we have satisfied the criteria of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition in the financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition  which include the point at which title and risk of ownership transfer to our customers 
these customers have specifically requested in writing  pursuant to a contract  that we invoice for the finished product and hold the finished product until a later date 
revenues from our aerospace equipment segment are derived from contracts that are accounted for in conformity with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contracts and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we account for these contracts using the percentage of completion method and measure progress on a cost to cost basis 
the percentage of completion method recognizes revenue as work on a contract progresses 
revenues are calculated based on the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs at completion of the contract 
for fixed price and fixed price incentive contracts  if at any time expected costs exceed the value of the contract  the loss is recognized immediately 
depreciable or amortizable lives of long lived assets our depreciable or amortizable long lived assets include property  plant and equipment and intangible assets  which are recorded at cost 
depreciation or amortization is recorded using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic useful life 
economic useful life is the duration of time that we expect the asset to be productively employed by us  which may be less than its physical life 
significant assumptions that affect the determination of estimated economic useful life include wear and tear  obsolescence  technical standards  contract life  and changes in market demand for products 
the estimated economic useful life of an asset is monitored to determine its appropriateness  especially in light of changed business circumstances 
for example  changes in technological advances  changes in the estimated future demand for products  or excessive wear and tear may result in a shorter estimated useful life than originally anticipated 
in these cases  we would depreciate the remaining net book value over the new estimated remaining life  thereby increasing depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
likewise  if the estimated useful life is increased  the adjustment to the useful life decreases depreciation expense per year on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets we test our property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such circumstances include  but are not limited to  operating or cash flow losses from the use of such assets or changes in our intended uses of such assets 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if we determine that an asset is not recoverable  then we would record an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is based on estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
the assumptions underlying cash flow projections represent management s best estimates at the time of the impairment review 
factors that management must estimate include industry and market conditions  sales volume and prices  costs to produce and inflation 
changes in key assumptions or actual conditions which differ from estimates could result in an impairment charge 
we use reasonable and supportable assumptions when performing impairment reviews but cannot predict the occurrence of future events and circumstances that could result in impairment charges 
environmental costs we are subject to environmental regulations that relate to our past and current operations 
we record liabilities for environmental remediation costs when our assessments indicate that remediation efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
on a quarterly basis  we review our estimates of future costs that could be incurred for remediation activities 
in some cases  only a range of reasonably possible costs can be estimated 
in establishing our reserves  the most probable estimate is used  otherwise  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
estimates of liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technologies and presently enacted laws and regulations 
these estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances 
accrued environmental remediation costs include the undiscounted cost of equipment  operating and maintenance costs  and fees to outside law firms or consultants  for the estimated duration of the remediation activity 
estimating environmental cost requires us to exercise substantial judgment regarding the cost  effectiveness and duration of our remediation activities 
actual future expenditures could differ materially from our current estimates 
we evaluate potential claims for recoveries from other parties separately from our estimated liabilities 
we record an asset for expected recoveries when recovery of the amounts are probable 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credits 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we evaluate the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets by estimating sources of future taxable income and the impact of tax planning strategies 
the effect of a change in the valuation allowance is reported in the current period tax provision 
actual income taxes paid may vary from estimates depending upon changes in income tax laws  actual results of operations  and the final audit of tax returns by taxing authorities 
tax assessments may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
pension benefits we sponsor defined benefit pension plans in various forms for employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several assumptions and statistical variables are used in actuarial models to calculate the pension expense and liability related to the various plans 
we determine the assumptions about the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and the future rate of compensation increases based on historical plan data 
the actuarial models also use assumptions on demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
depending on the assumptions selected  pension expense could vary significantly and could have a material effect on reported earnings 
the assumptions used can also materially affect the measurement of benefit obligations 
recently issued or adopted accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning october  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which documents the sec staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
under sab  we must evaluate the materiality of an identified unadjusted error by considering the impact of both the current year error and the cumulative error  if applicable 
this also means that both the impact on the current period income statement and the period end balance sheet must be considered 
sab is effective for our fiscal year ended september  any past adjustments required to be recorded as a result of adopting sab have been recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we recorded no adjustments to our consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of sab in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
sfas no 
will be first effective for our financial statements issued for the year ending september   and interim periods within that year 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  sfas no 
which requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas no 
became effective for us on september  the adoption of sfas had the effect of increasing long term pension obligations by  and decreasing total stockholders equity by a corresponding amount see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item to this report 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by sfas no 
permits all companies to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
at each subsequent reporting date  a company must report in earnings any unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of our first fiscal year that begins on october  we are currently evaluating whether to adopt the fair value option under sfas no 
and evaluating what impact adoption would have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily due to changes in market interest rates as compared to the fixed rate for our long term debt 
as of september   our outstanding debt is comprised primarily of  aggregate principal of the senior notes 
at september   we had no amount outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
we estimate that the fair value of the senior notes to be approximately  based on trade data as of september  in may  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements  to have expired on june   for the purpose of hedging a portion of our exposure to changes in variable rate interest on our credit facilities 
in connection with the refinancing of our credit facilities  we terminated our swap agreements at a cost of  which resulted in a gain of that is recorded as a reduction of interest expense
