the company anticipates placing this asset in service in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap that require the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are those that require subjective or complex judgments and are the policies and estimates that the company deems most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations 
it is possible that the use of different reasonable estimates or assumptions in making these judgments could result in materially different amounts being reported in our consolidated financial statements 
the company s critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  including evaluation of the collectibility of accounts receivable  impairment of long lived assets and purchase accounting for acquisitions of real estate 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of these critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition rental revenue under leases with scheduled rent increases or rent abatements is recognized using the straight line method over the term of the leases 
accrued straight line rents included in the company s consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over contractual rent under applicable lease provisions 
the company s leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse the company for a portion of the company s property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized on the date of termination when the related leases are canceled and the company has no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
the company must make estimates to the collectibility of its accounts receivables related to minimum rent  deferred rent  tenant reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  tenant concentrations  tenant creditworthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income as a higher required allowance for doubtful accounts receivable will result in lower net income 
investments in real estate and real estate entities investments in real estate are recorded at cost 
improvements and replacements are capitalized when they extend the useful life  increase capacity  or improve the efficiency of the asset 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are recorded on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives as follows buildings years building improvements to years furniture  fixtures and equipment to years tenant improvements shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the terms of the related leases the company reviews market conditions for possible impairment of a property s carrying value 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions or changes in management s intended holding period indicate a possible impairment of the value of a property  an impairment analysis is performed 
the company assesses the recoverability based on an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the real estate investment s use and eventual disposition 
this estimate is based on projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly used by appraisers 
these cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of its investments in real estate 
the company will classify a building as held for sale when the sale of the building is probable and likely to be completed within one year 
accordingly  the company classifies assets as held for sale and will cease recording depreciation when our board of trustees has approved a plan of disposal  an active program to complete the plan to sell has been initiated  including active marketing of the property  and the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition 
if these criteria are met  the company will record an impairment loss if the fair value reduced by selling costs is lower than the carrying amount of the building 
the company will classify the impairment loss  together with the building s operating results  as discontinued operations on its statement of operations and classify the assets and related liabilities as held for sale on the balance sheet 
interest expense is reclassified to discontinued operations only to the extent the property to be disposed of secures specific mortgage debt 
during may and november  the company sold its properties located at business parkway and ammendale road  respectively 
as a result  operating results and the gains on disposal for these assets are reflected as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
the company has had no continuing involvement with the properties subsequent to their disposal 
purchase accounting acquisitions of rental property from third parties are accounted for at fair value 
fair value of the real estate acquired is determined on an as if vacant basis 
that value is allocated between land and building based on management s estimate of the fair value of those components for each type of property and to tenant improvements based on the net carrying value of the tenant improvements  which approximates their fair value 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the tangible assets on an as if vacant basis is allocated as follows value of leases based on the leasing origination costs at the date of the acquisition  which approximates the market value of the lease origination costs had the in place leases been originated on the date of acquisition  the value of in place leases represents absorption costs for the estimated lease up period in which vacancy and foregone revenue are incurred and leasing commissions  the value of above and below market in place leases based on the present values using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between the contractual rent amounts including amounts related to the reimbursement of fixed operating costs and market rents over the remaining non cancelable lease terms  ranging from one to twenty one years  and the intangible value of tenant or customer relationships 
the company s determination of these values requires it to estimate market rents for each of the leases and make certain other assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the rental revenue  depreciation expense and amortization expense it recognizes for these leases and associated intangible assets and liabilities 
stock compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which requires that the cost for all share based payment transactions be recognized as a component of income from continuing operations 
the statement requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period

the same property noi results are presented without the inclusion of corporate level expenses  as well as depreciation and amortization expense  and exclude termination fees as they are infrequent and can vary significantly period over period thus impacting trends and comparability 
the company eliminates its corporate level expenses to arrive at the property level results  which it feels provides the investor with greater insight into the performance of its properties and useful information for evaluating the period over period operating performance of its portfolio 
this presentation allows management and investors to distinguish whether growth or declines in same property noi are a result of increases or decreases in property operations or the acquisition of additional properties

off balance sheet arrangements the company was not a party to any joint venture agreements and had no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  or disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes known material contractual obligations associated with investing and financing activities as of december  amounts in thousands

capital expenditure obligations represent commitments for roof  asphalt and hvac replacements contractually obligated as of december  tenant improvement obligations include costs the company expects to incur on leases in place at december  the company had no other material contractual obligations as of december  funds from operations many investors and analysts following the real estate industry use funds from operations ffo as a supplemental performance measure 
while the company believes net income available to common shareholders as defined by gaap is the most appropriate measure of operating results  management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  in its march white paper as amended in november and april  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo in accordance with nareit s definition  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo  or similarly titled measures  used by other companies and  therefore  our presentation may not be comparable to their presentations 
the company adds back minority interest in the income from its operating partnership in determining ffo 
the company believes this is appropriate as operating partnership units are presented on an as converted  one for one basis for shares of stock in determining ffo per fully diluted share 
ffo should not be viewed as a substitute for net income as a measure of the company s operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company s properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact the company s results of operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common share and unitholders for the years presented funds from operations year ended december  amounts in thousands net income add depreciation and amortization of real estate assets discontinued operations depreciation and amortization minority interests deduct gain on sale of disposed property ffo available to common shareholders and unitholders weighted average number of diluted common shares and operating partnership units outstanding forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws
