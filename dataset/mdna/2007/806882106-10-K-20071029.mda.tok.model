this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on management s plans that are subject to uncertainty 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  and the selected financial data and operating statistics contained elsewhere in this form k 
business the company operates in three reportable segments mrb  apb and smb 
mrb purchases  collects  processes and recycles steel and other metal through its facilities and trades and brokers scrap metal 
apb purchases used and salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts through its self service and full service auto parts stores 
apb is also a supplier of autobodies to mrb  which processes the autobodies into saleable recycled metal 
smb purchases recycled metal from mrb and uses its mini mill near portland  oregon  to melt recycled metal to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains mill depots in central and southern california 
the company provides an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through its integrated businesses  including resale of used auto parts  processing autobodies and other metal products and manufacturing scrap metal into finished steel products 
the company s results of operations depend in large part on demand and prices for recycled metal in global markets and steel products in the western us the company s deep water port facilities on both the west and east coasts of the us and in hawaii allow the company to take advantage of the increasing demand for recycled metal by steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  mexico and the mediterranean 
the company s processing facilities in the southeastern us also provide access to the growing automobile and steel manufacturing industries in that region 
market prices for recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal fluctuate periodically  but have generally increased over the past three years 
these higher prices have a significant impact on the results of operations for mrb and  to a lesser extent  for apb 
key factors and trends affecting the industries in which the company operates and its results of operations the following key factors and trends affect the industries in which the company operates competition  consolidation in the scrap metal industry and the steel industry  fragmentation of the auto parts industry and volatility in price and sales volume decreases in the metals recycling industry 
the following key factors and trends specifically affect the company s results of operations the integration of acquired businesses  foreign business risks  replacement or installation of capital equipment  reliance on key pieces of equipment  geographic concentration  union relationships and pension and postretirement benefits 
the foregoing key factors and trends are discussed elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the company completed another successful year in fiscal  achieving record sales levels for the sixth consecutive year 
the company generated consolidated revenues of billion for fiscal  an increase of million  or  from billion in fiscal consolidated operating income for fiscal increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was generated from all segments  while the increase in operating income was driven primarily from the improved financial results of mrb 
net income for fiscal was million  a decrease of million  or compared to the prior year net income of million 
diluted net income per share for the year was  a decrease from fiscal net income in fiscal included a million gain net of tax from the separation and termination of the hnc joint ventures  which was partially offset by a million charge related to the sec and doj investigations into the company s past payment practices in asia 
in fiscal  mrb increased its revenues of by million  or  to billion from billion in fiscal the increase included a million increase in ferrous revenues  or  to billion and a million 
table of contents increase in nonferrous revenues  or  to million 
the increase in ferrous revenues was driven by a increase in sales tons and a increase in average net sales price 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by a increase in sales tons and a increase in average net sales price 
operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues in fiscal the increase in operating income reflects the impact of the higher sales volume and prices 
while the majority of the higher material costs were recovered through the higher net sales prices discussed above  the additional volume resulted in operating income being reduced as a percent of sales 
further offsetting the increases in average sales prices and volume was a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily due to million of higher compensation costs as a result of increased headcount  bonuses  and share based compensation expense and a million increase in allocated erp and other information technology costs 
in fiscal  apb increased its revenues by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase included a million increase in core revenue  or  over the prior year  a million increase in scrap vehicle revenue  or  from the self service stores over the prior year  and a million increase in full service revenue over the prior year 
the increase in core revenue was primarily due to a increase in the average core sales per car and a  increase in cars crushed 
the increase in scrap vehicle revenue was due to a increase in the average scrap sales price per car and a  increase in tons shipped 
the increase in full service revenue was due to higher parts sales across several product types and as a result of a full year of revenues for greenleaf  which was acquired during the first quarter of fiscal operating income for apb was million  or of revenue in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues in fiscal the slight increase in operating income for fiscal reflects the impact of higher sales volume and prices 
while the majority of the higher car costs were recovered through the higher sales prices discussed above  the additional volume resulted in operating income being reduced as a percent of revenue 
the increases in operating income were further offset by a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily attributable to a million increase in allocated erp and other information technology costs and a million increase in compensation expenses 
in fiscal  smb increased its revenues by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the increase over the prior year was the result of higher average net sales prices for finished steel products  due in part to strong demand  increased sales volumes and an improved product mix 
sales volumes increased  tons  or  to  tons in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the average net selling price increased per ton  or  to per ton in fiscal compared to fiscal and resulted in increased revenues of million 
operating income for smb was million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues in fiscal the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of higher raw material costs and higher conversion costs  which could not be passed through to smb s customers through higher prices 
also during fiscal  the company repurchased million shares  or approximately of total shares outstanding for a total cost of million under the authority granted by its board of directors 
business acquisitions the company intends to continue to focus on growth through value creating acquisitions and will pursue acquisition opportunities it believes will create shareholder value and earn after tax income in excess of its cost of capital 
with the company s continued strong balance sheet  cash flows from operations and available borrowing capacity  the company believes it is in an attractive position to continue to complete reasonably priced acquisitions fitting the company s long term strategic plans 
in fiscal  the company completed the following acquisitions in december  the company acquired a metals recycling business to provide additional sources of scrap metals for the mega shredder in everett  massachusetts 
in may  the company acquired two metals recycling businesses that separately provide scrap metal to the everett  massachusetts and tacoma  washington facilities 
these acquisitions were not material to the company s financial position or results of operations  as the combined assets of these business acquisitions amounted to million  or of consolidated total assets  as of august  and their combined revenues amounted to million  or of consolidated revenues  for fiscal 
table of contents the company completed the following significant transactions in on september  the company completed the separation and termination of its metals recycling joint ventures with hnc 
on september   the company acquired greenleaf and five store properties leased by greenleaf and assumed certain greenleaf liabilities 
greenleaf is engaged in the business of auto dismantling and recycling and sells its products primarily to collision and mechanical repair shops 
on october   the company purchased substantially all the assets of regional 
the company now operates nine metals recycling facilities located in georgia and alabama  focused on both ferrous and nonferrous metals 
on march   the company purchased the minority interest in its mrl subsidiary 
the company assumed control of the mrl operations upon the separation and termination of its joint venture with hnc 
mrl operates a metals recycling facility in rhode island

the increases in revenues and operating income that resulted from the election were offset in the statement of income by pre acquisition interests  net of tax 
see note business combinations in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as a result of the hnc joint venture separation and termination agreement  the joint venture segment was eliminated and the results for the two entities acquired in this transaction  in which the company had a previous interest  and all remaining joint ventures were consolidated into mrb as of the beginning of fiscal the company determined that retroactively adjusting prior period results for entities acquired in this transaction is not meaningful given that the company was a partner and was not involved in managing the day to day operations of these entities prior to the separation 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated corporate expenses for services that benefit all three business segments 
because of this unallocated expense  the operating income of each segment does not reflect the operating income the segment would have as a stand alone business 
recycled ferrous metal sales from mrb to smb and autobody sales from apb to mrb are made at negotiated rates per ton that are intended to approximate market prices 
consequently  these intercompany revenues produce intercompany operating income  which is not recognized until the finished products are sold to third parties 
cost of goods sold balances disclosed above include amounts for environmental matters separately stated on the consolidated statements of income 
see part ii  item of this report 
revenues consolidated revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to billion from billion in fiscal revenues in fiscal increased for all company business segments 
the increase was primarily the result of higher 
table of contents volumes in all business segments due to the company s focus on increasing throughput  the added volumes from a full year of operations for the acquisitions made in fiscal and increases in the market price of scrap and steel 
consolidated revenues for fiscal increased billion  or  to billion from million in fiscal revenues increased as a result of the acquisitions made in the mrb and apb reporting segments in fiscal and an increase in production from smb 
cost of goods sold consolidated cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion for fiscal  compared to the prior year 
cost of goods sold in fiscal increased for all business segments  primarily resulting from increased material prices and increases due to a full year of operations for the acquisitions made in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold increased from in fiscal to in fiscal consolidated cost of goods sold increased million  or  to billion for fiscal compared to the prior year 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of goods sold increased from in fiscal to in fiscal mainly as a result of acquisitions that occurred during fiscal selling  general and administrative expense sg a expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to the prior year 
the million increase over fiscal was due to higher sg a expense incurred at each of the reporting segments  totaling million combined  which was partially offset by a million decrease at corporate 
these increases at the reporting segments were primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense of million due to increased headcount  bonuses and share based compensation expense recognized for fiscal  a million increase related to higher allocated information technology costs as a result of the implementation and maintenance of an enterprise resource planning erp software application  including related hardware upgrades and support  and other information technology costs 
the net decrease at corporate over the prior year was due primarily to the million charge in fiscal associated with the establishment of a reserve related to the penalties that the company estimated would be imposed by the doj and the sec in connection with the investigation into the company s past payment practices in asia as discussed in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the net decrease at corporate for fiscal included an million increase in compensation costs resulting from increased headcount  bonus and share based compensation expense 
sg a expenses increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to the prior year 
these increases were primarily attributable to a million increase in sg a expenses from the businesses acquired in fiscal and a million increase in costs associated with the doj and the sec investigation  as discussed in note commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
in addition  there were increases of million in contract labor  legal and accounting fees  an increase of million in compensation costs and a million increase in share based compensation expense recognized in fiscal interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to reflects higher average interest rates and the company carrying higher average debt balances during fiscal in order to complete and integrate acquisitions  as well as to support the increased level of working capital for the operations of these acquisitions  in addition to million related to share repurchases 
for more information about the company s outstanding debt balances  see note long term debt  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal was the result of higher average interest rates and the company carrying higher average debt balances 

table of contents other income  net of interest expense other income was million  million and million for fiscal   and  respectively 
during fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million that arose from the hnc separation and termination agreement  based on the difference between the excess values of businesses acquired over the carrying value of the businesses sold 
for a more detailed discussion of the hnc joint venture separation and termination agreement  see note business combinations  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
income tax expense the tax rates were  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the tax rate in fiscal was higher than in fiscal primarily because of an accrual recorded in fiscal of million for nondeductible penalties and profits disgorgement expensed in connection with the settlement of the sec and doj investigation see item legal proceedings 
the nondeductible expense increased the fiscal tax rate by 
in addition  the fiscal tax rate was higher than normal because it included an estimated tax rate of for the non recurring million gain arising from the hnc separation and termination see note business combinations  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report  that was higher than the rate applicable to the company s recurring income 
the fiscal tax rate was comprised of the federal statutory rate  a effective state rate and for nondeductible officers compensation  offset by a benefit from a section manufacturing deduction and the extraterritorial income exclusion benefit on export sales 
financial results by segment the company operates its business across three reportable segments mrb  apb and smb 
additional financial information relating to these business segments is contained in note segment information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

as a result of the hnc joint venture separation and termination agreement  the joint venture segment was eliminated and the results for the two entities acquired in this transaction  in which the company had a previous interest  and all remaining joint ventures were consolidated into mrb as of the beginning of fiscal the company determined that retroactively adjusting prior period results for entities acquired in this transaction is not meaningful given that the company was a partner and was not involved in managing the day to day operations of these entities prior to the separation 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal revenues mrb generated revenues of billion for fiscal before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes as a result of the focus on increasing throughput at its processing facilities and prevailing market conditions whereby scrap metal demand was higher than supply  resulting in higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes 
outbound freight costs  which  are included in the gross sales price  increased by to million for fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased volumes and higher ocean freight rates 
ferrous revenues increased million  or  to billion during fiscal  compared to the prior year 
the increase in ferrous revenues was driven by both higher average net sales prices and increased volumes 
the average net sales price for ferrous processing increased per ton  or from fiscal to fiscal the average net sales price for ferrous trading increased per ton  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal ferrous processing sales volume increased by million tons  or  to million tons in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the strategy to increase the volume of metal purchases and maximize throughput  which was accomplished through continued acquisitions of metal recyclers and increased purchases of ferrous materials 
ferrous trading sales volume remained fairly consistent at million tons for both fiscal and other domestic sales volume increased to  tons in fiscal  primarily as a result of the regional acquisition made during fiscal nonferrous revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to the same period last year 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by both higher average net sales prices and increased volume 
the average net sales price increased  or  to per pound for fiscal over fiscal the increase in sales price per pound was the result of an improved product mix due to regional and other acquisitions and increased asian demand for nonferrous metals 
nonferrous pounds shipped increased million pounds  or  to nearly million pounds for fiscal  compared to the prior year 
the increase in pounds shipped was primarily due to improvement in the recovery of nonferrous materials processed through the new mega shredders  which have state of the art back end sorting systems and the higher overall volume being processed 
segment operating income operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the increase in operating income reflects the impact of the higher sales volume and the improved performance discussed above  partially offset by higher raw material costs  which increased on average  over fiscal while the majority of the higher material cost was recovered through the higher net sales prices discussed above  operating income was reduced as a percent of revenues 
further offsetting the increases in average sales prices and volume was a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily due to million of higher compensation costs as a result of increased headcount  bonuses  and share based compensation expense and a million increase in allocated erp and other information technology costs 
fiscal compared with fiscal mrb generated revenues of billion for fiscal  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million  or over fiscal ferrous revenues increased million  or over fiscal  primarily due to acquisition related volume increases  which were partially offset by the decrease in the average net selling price for ferrous metal in fiscal nonferrous revenues increased million  or  over fiscal  primarily as a result of increased sales generated by the acquired entities and an increase of per pound  or  in the average nonferrous sales price 
operating income for mrb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the million increase in operating income was directly related to the increase in sales volume as a result of entities acquired in fiscal 
table of contents outlook demand for recycled ferrous metal is driven by world wide steel making capacity 
in recent years  steel making capacity has increased significantly  primarily in the developing economies of the middle east and asia 
due to this increased capacity  the demand for recycled metal has increased while at the same time the supply of metal available for recycling has not kept pace 
as a result  prices for recycled metals have increased to levels higher than experienced in previous economic cycles 
the company believes these fundamentals will remain in the place for fiscal  and while prices will continue to remain volatile  the general level of prices will be consistent with fiscal to better take advantage of the positive markets in which it operates  mrb has made significant investments in the past two fiscal years to upgrade its equipment and infrastructure 
mrb believes these investments will enable it to increase its capacity to process recycled metal  increase the extraction of higher value materials and improve overall operating efficiency 
the additional capacity and improved efficiencies support mrb s efforts to seek additional sources of supply and increase the throughput at its processing facilities 
due to the strong demand described above  the competition for recycled metal has been increasing  and mrb expects its efforts to maintain and increase the supply of recycled material it is able to purchase from suppliers could result in higher prices for those inputs 
nonetheless  mrb believes the size  breadth and efficiency of its operations provide it with a competitive advantage in procuring raw material and will allow it to continue to grow the volume of material available for sale into the world markets during fiscal mrb also believes its access to deep water ports provide it with an efficient platform for exporting recycled metals to customers in asia  the middle east and around the world 
mrb utilizes ocean going vessels to access these markets and the demand for vessels of the size and type required by mrb has been increasing 
historically  any change in the cost of shipping has been reflected in the price paid by customers for the metals being delivered 
however  toward the end of fiscal  the cost of shipping began to rise significantly  and while mrb believes the historical relationship between the prices for recycled metal and the cost of shipping the product to customers in asia and elsewhere will remain consistent  rapid changes in shipping costs may result in margin pressures during fiscal auto parts business for the year ended august  increase decrease in thousands vs vs revenues cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense segment operating income fiscal compared with fiscal revenues apb generated revenues of million for fiscal  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase over the prior year was primarily driven by increased sales of scrapped vehicles and cores  higher average sales prices and higher sales volume 
core revenue increased million  or  over the prior year  primarily due to a increase in the average core sales per car and an increase of  cars crushed 
scrap vehicle revenue from the self service business increased million  or  over the prior year  resulting from a increase in the average scrap sales price per car and an increase in volume of  tons shipped 
in addition  full service revenue increased million over the prior year due to higher parts sales across several product types and as a result of a full year of revenues for the greenleaf full service business  which was acquired during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  apb also benefited from the improved revenue contribution of the five stores converted from full service to self service compared to the same period last year 

table of contents segment operating income operating income for apb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the slight increase in operating income for fiscal reflects the impact of higher sales volume and improved performance at the full service stores  offset by higher raw material costs  which increased per car  or  over fiscal scrap tons sold increased  tons  or  from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the increases in operating income were further offset by a million increase in sg a expenses compared to the prior year  primarily attributable to a million increase in allocated erp and other information technology costs and a million increase in compensation expenses 
fiscal compared with fiscal apb generated revenues of million for fiscal  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to million of revenues generated from the greenleaf acquisition that occurred during fiscal operating income for apb was million  or of revenues in fiscal  compared to operating income of million  or of revenue  for fiscal the decrease in margins primarily attributable to apb s entry into the full service used parts market  which has higher costs associated with the purchase and removal of parts sold through the full service distribution model  and increased demand and competition for unprocessed metals  which increased the costs for the purchase of cars in the self service distribution model 
outlook apb operates two distribution channels in the used auto parts industry 
the first  self service auto parts  is primarily focused on older  end of life vehicles 
self service revenues are driven by admissions and parts sales as well as wholesale revenues from the sale of cores and scrapped vehicles 
apb remains committed to increasing its purchases of scrapped vehicles and believes that the increased volume should result in higher revenues from the sale of cores and scrap in fiscal demand in apb s second distribution channel  full service used auto parts  is driven primarily by the professional repair market 
apb s strategy has been to increase both the quantity and quality of its inventory by utilizing computer buying models that focus on acquiring used autos that contain high demand parts  which it believes will enable it to increase sales in its full service distribution channel in fiscal steel manufacturing business for the year ended august  increase decrease in thousands vs vs revenues cost of goods sold selling  general and administrative expense segment operating income average sales price ton finished steel products sold tons  in thousands price information is shown after excluding the cost of freight incurred to deliver the product to the customer 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues smb generated revenues of million for fiscal  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase over the prior year was the result of higher average net sales prices for finished steel products  due in part to strong demand  increased sales volume and an improved product 
table of contents mix 
sales volume increased  tons  or  to  tons in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the average net selling price increased per ton  or  to per ton in fiscal compared to fiscal and resulted in increased revenues of million 
segment operating income operating income for smb was million  or of revenues  in fiscal  compared to million  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in operating income reflects the impact of a increase in the cost of scrap metal  which outpaced the increase in average sales price per ton  an increase of per ton in conversion costs  primarily related to higher costs for raw materials  other than scrap metals and million in costs associated with the planned shut down of the larger rolling mill in the third quarter of fiscal smb acquired all of its scrap metal requirements from mrb at negotiated rates intended to approximate market prices 
fiscal compared with fiscal smb generated revenues of million in fiscal  before intercompany eliminations  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of tons sold of  tons  or  and an increase of per ton in the average net selling price in fiscal over fiscal the increase in sales volume was primarily due to increased demand from customers and capital improvements by smb that enabled the steel mill to increase output to meet the demand 
the average net selling price increased as a result of increased worldwide steel consumption and higher raw material costs that manufacturers passed through in the form of higher prices 
operating income for smb in fiscal was million  or of revenues  compared to fiscal operating income of million  or of revenues 
the higher operating margins were primarily attributable to the increase in production and a reduction in labor costs  raw material costs and melt shop conversion costs  reflecting the efficiencies gained through capital and equipment improvements 
outlook smb sells its products primarily to construction markets located on the west coast of the us in the past few years  demand in these markets has been strong and west coast steel manufacturers have generally been operating at full capacity 
the strong demand has attracted competition from imported steel but prices have remained high by historical standards 
as the market for steel products is worldwide  the level of imports is dependent upon differences in market prices in the us and that attainable in other markets around the world 
west coast demand for steel is based upon both residential and non residential construction activity 
during  lower demand caused by a slowdown in the housing sector was offset by continued good demand in commercial construction 
while the latter is closely related to economic conditions in the region  the high level of expected state and federal government spending in the west related to highway infrastructure may provide an offset to any weakening in commercial construction activity going forward 
to better take advantage of the positive market environment in which it operates  smb has made a serious of capital investments that have increased capacity and improved efficiencies 
as a result of these investments  capacity at the mill has been increased from around  tons annually prior to to greater than  tons currently 
in  smb believes market demand will enable it to sell the incremental product it is able to produce 
the increased demand for steel worldwide has resulted in higher prices for the raw materials used in steel making  including scrap metal  alloys and fluxes 
the ability of steel manufacturers to pass through increased costs is a function of demand in the markets in which they operate 
during  margins at smb declined as the rise in raw material costs was greater than the increase in net selling prices 
during  raw material prices are expected to remain firm  and the ability of smb to pass through these costs will be dependent upon the strength of market demand and the level of competition from foreign imports 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company relies on cash provided by operating activities as a primary source of liquidity  supplemented by current cash resources and existing credit facilities 
sources and uses of cash the company had cash balances of million  million and million at august   and  respectively 
cash balances are intended to be used for working capital and capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  which included net income of million  million of depreciation and amortization expense  an increase in accounts payable of million due to the timing of payments and a decrease in inventory of million due to timing of shipments 
these sources of cash were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable due to the high volume of shipments made in the fourth quarter  and the million payment for the sec and doj settlement 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a slight decrease in net income of million  and a decrease in the impact of non cash items  which was primarily related to a non cash gain from the hnc separation and termination agreement in  along with tax benefits from employee stock options 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures to upgrade the company s equipment and infrastructure and million in acquisitions completed in fiscal the increase in outflows for investing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily related to capital expenditure costs to modernize and upgrade the company s infrastructure and equipment  along with significant acquisitions that occurred in fiscal net cash used in financing activities for fiscal was million  compared to million of cash provided by financing activities in fiscal and net cash used by financing activities of million in fiscal the increase in cash used in financing activities from fiscal to was primarily due to million in share repurchases  partially offset by million provided by net borrowings 
the increase in cash from financing activities in fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of the company s increased borrowings in fiscal credit facilities the company has short term borrowings consisting primarily of an unsecured credit line  which was increased on march   by million to million 
this line of credit expires on march  interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the unsecured line of credit are set by the bank at the time of borrowing 
the credit available under this agreement is uncommitted 
the company had million of borrowings outstanding on this line as of august  the weighted average interest rate on this line was at august  there were no amounts outstanding under the agreement as of august  in november  the company entered into an amended and restated unsecured committed bank credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and the other lenders party thereto  which was amended in july the revised agreement provides for a five year  million revolving credit facility loan maturing in july interest rates on outstanding indebtedness under the amended agreement are based  at the company s option  on either the london interbank offered rate libor plus a spread of between and  with the amount of the spread based on a pricing grid tied to the company s leverage ratio  or the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus 
in addition  annual commitment fees are payable on the unused portion of the credit facility at rates between and based on a pricing grid tied to the company s leverage ratio 
as of august  and  the company had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility of million and million  respectively 
the two bank credit agreements contain various representations and warranties  events of default and financial and other covenants  including covenants regarding maintenance of a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and a 
table of contents maximum leverage ratio 
as of august   the company was in compliance with all such covenants  representations and warranties 
in addition  as of august  and  the company had million of long term bonded indebtedness that matures in january capital expenditures capital expenditures totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increases in capital expenditures primarily reflect the company s significant investments in modern equipment to improve the efficiency and capabilities of its businesses and to further enhance the company s competitiveness 
the capital expenditures in fiscal included partial payments for the installation of new mega shredders at the company s oakland  california  everett  massachusetts  and portland  oregon export facilities  major repairs to the dock at the portland  oregon facility and other upgrades to equipment and infrastructure at the mrb facilities 
the company also expended capital for the implementation of a point of sale system at its self service used auto parts stores  the conversion of five sites acquired in the greenleaf acquisition to the company s self service store model and the upgrade of the reheat furnace  billet craneway and other projects at the smb facility designed to improve efficiency and increase output 
the company anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal will approximate the expenditures made in fiscal capital projects in fiscal are expected to include significant enhancements to the company s information technology infrastructure  further investments in technology to improve the recovery of nonferrous materials from the shredding process  the establishment of additional nonferrous collection facilities  improvements to the company s marine shipping infrastructure and further investments to improve efficiency  increase worker safety and enhance environmental systems 
the company expects to use cash from operations to fund capital expenditures and available lines of credit to fund acquisitions in fiscal share repurchase program pursuant to a share repurchase program as amended in and in october  the company is authorized to repurchase up to million shares of its class a common stock when management deems such repurchases to be appropriate 
management evaluates long and short range forecasts as well as anticipated sources and uses of cash before determining the course of action that would best enhance shareholder value 
prior to fiscal  the company had repurchased million shares under the program 
in fiscal  the company repurchased a total of million shares under this program  leaving million shares available for repurchase 
pension contributions the company maintains a defined benefit plan for certain of its non union employees 
in fiscal  pension benefits were frozen for employees covered under this plan 
employees participating in the defined benefit plan and other employees of the company will receive future retirement benefits under defined contribution retirement plans sponsored by the company  which makes periodic contributions to fund the plans within the range allowed by applicable regulations 
the company makes contributions to a defined benefit pension plan  several defined contribution plans and several multi employer pension plans 
contributions vary depending on the plan and are based upon plan provisions  actuarial valuations and negotiated labor agreements 
in fiscal  the company froze further benefit accruals in its defined benefit plan and as a result made no further contributions in fiscal and anticipates making no contributions in fiscal however  changes in the discount rate or actual investment returns different from the expected long term rate of return on plan assets could require the company to make future contributions 
the company believes any additional funding requirements would not have a material impact on its financial condition

the company expects to make contributions to its various defined contribution plans of approximately million in fiscal included in this amount is million  of contributions the company anticipates making to the multi employer plans  including a contribution of more than million for the multi employer plan benefiting union employees of smb 

table of contents assessment of liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s available cash resources  internally generated funds  credit facilities and equity offerings have financed its acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other financing needs 
the company believes its current cash resources  internally generated funds  and existing credit facilities will provide adequate financing for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  joint ventures  stock repurchases  debt service requirements  post retirement obligations and future environmental obligations for the next twelve months 
in the longer term  the company may seek to finance business expansion with additional borrowing arrangements or additional equity financing 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases  the company is not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on the company s financial conditions  results of operations or cash flows 
the company enters into operating leases for both new equipment and property 
contractual obligations and commitments the company has certain contractual obligations to make future payments 
the following table summarizes these future obligations as of august  in thousands payment due by period thereafter total contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital leases  including interest pension funding obligations operating leases service obligation purchase obligations materials purchase commitment gas contract electric contract total smb has a take or pay natural gas contract that currently requires a minimum purchase of  mmbtu per day at tiered pricing  whether or not the amount is utilized 
effective april  through october   the blended rate was per mmbtu 
the blended rate decreases to effective november  through october  the contract expires on may  smb has an electricity contract with mwl that requires a minimum purchase of electricity at a rate subject to variable pricing  whether or not the amount is utilized 
the fixed portion of the contract obligates smb to pay  per month for eleven months each year until the contract expires in september critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the company s portrayal of its financial condition and operating results 
these estimates require difficult and subjective judgments  including whether estimates are required to be made about matters that are inherently uncertain  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the financial statements 
significant estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible asset valuation  environmental costs  contingencies  assessment of the valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax contingencies  pension plan assumptions  share based compensation assumptions and revenue recognition 

table of contents inventories the company s inventories primarily consist of ferrous and nonferrous unprocessed metals  ferrous processed metals  used and salvaged vehicles and finished steel products consisting of rebar  coiled rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
mrb determines the cost of ferrous and nonferrous inventories principally using the average cost method and capitalizes substantially all direct costs and yard costs into inventory 
apb establishes cost for used and salvage vehicle inventory based on the average price the company pays for a vehicle 
the self service business capitalizes only the vehicle cost into inventory while the full service business capitalizes the vehicle cost  dismantling and  where applicable  storage and towing fees into inventory 
smb establishes its finished steel product inventory cost based on a weighted average cost and capitalizes all direct and indirect costs of manufacturing into inventory 
indirect costs of manufacturing include general plant costs  maintenance  human resources and yard costs 
the accounting process utilized by the company to record unprocessed metal and used and salvage vehicle inventory quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metals inventory  the company relies on perpetual inventory records that utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends and periodic tests for certain unprocessed metal commodities 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metals 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of the company s inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  the company runs periodic tests and performs monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  the company adjusts the value of its ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume 
in addition  the company establishes inventory reserves based upon historical experience of adjustments to further mitigate the risk of significant adjustments when determined reasonable 
currently the reserve is established at of processed ferrous inventory 
an increase in the reserve of would reduce the value of inventory by less than million 
the company does not maintain a reserve for nonferrous inventory  as quantities on hand by yard turn over rapidly and are typically low enough that amounts can be accurately determined 
goodwill and other intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas  the company is required to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step determines whether or not impairment has occurred by estimating the fair value of its reporting units using the present value of future cash flows approach  subject to a comparison for reasonableness to its market capitalization at the date of valuation 
the second step measures the amount of any impairment 
these tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by estimated future cash flows developed by management 
selected costs and statistics used to evaluate goodwill are typically related to pricing and volumes of goods sold  costs as a percentage of revenues and the cyclicality inherent in the company s industries 
environmental costs the company operates in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  the company employs both its own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to stay updated on environmental risks 
the company estimates future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrues for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that the company has incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is extremely complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation of potential sites 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts 
table of contents can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than another  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter results in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors which the company considers in its recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include the following current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the clean up  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site  which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of both senior level internal staff and external consultants  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the remediation 
accrued worker s compensation costs the company is self insured up to a maximum amount per claim for worker s compensation claims and  as such  a reserve for the costs of claims that have not been paid and the estimated cost of incurred but not reported claims as of the balance sheet date is estimated 
the company s exposure to claims is protected by various stop loss insurance policies 
the reserve is established based on historical claim experience 
at august  and  the company accrued million and million  respectively  for the estimated cost of worker s compensation claims 
if the ultimate development of these claims is significantly different than those that have been estimated  the accrual for future worker s compensation claims could be materially overstated or understated 
deferred taxes deferred income taxes reflect the differences at fiscal year end between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
periodically  the company reviews its deferred tax assets to assess whether a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent the assets are more likely than not to be unrealized 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the company s deferred tax assets will be realized 
if the ultimate realization of the company s deferred tax assets is significantly different than the expectations  the value of our deferred tax assets could be materially overstated 
pension plans the company sponsors a defined benefit pension plan for certain of its non union employees 
pension plans are a significant cost of doing business  and the related obligations are expected to be settled far in the future 
accounting for defined benefit pension plans results in the current recognition of liabilities and net periodic pension cost over employees expected service periods based on the terms of the plans and the impact of the company s investment and funding decisions 
the measurement of pension obligations and recognition of liabilities and costs require significant assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on the assets of the plan  may have an impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
actual results will often differ from assumptions relating to long term rates of return for equities and fixed income securities because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate assumption as of august  was 
a increase or decrease in the discount rate would reduce or increase the net pension liability by approximately million as of august  and accumulated other comprehensive income would be reduced or increased by the same amount  adjusted for taxes  and net periodic cost for fiscal would be reduced or increased by  the weighted average expected return on assets assumption as of august  was 
the expected return on assets is a long term assumption whose accuracy can only be measured over a long period based on past experience 
a increase or decrease in this assumption would reduce or increase net periodic pension cost by  
table of contents the company adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas on august  sfas requires an employer to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans as a net asset or liability in its statement of financial position  with an offsetting amount in accumulated other comprehensive income  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income 
following the adoption of sfas  additional minimum pension liabilities and related intangible assets are no longer recognized 
for further detail regarding the company s pension plans  refer to note employee benefits  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
share based compensation effective september   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  shared based payment sfas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of share based compensation in net income 
the company elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas r  and therefore  did not retroactively adjust the results of prior periods 
under this transition method  compensation expense based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  share based payment for all share based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  september   is being recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption 
share based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted after september  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the company recognizes compensation expense  net of a forfeiture rate  on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the five year vesting term for stock options and restricted stock units rsus and the three year performance period for performance based shares 
the company estimated the forfeiture rate based on historical experience during the preceding five fiscal years 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility  which is based on historical month end closing stock prices 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  the company s share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to fully vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what the company has recorded in the current period 
see note stock incentive plan  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized when the company has a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both scrap metal and finished steel products transfers upon shipment  based on either cost  insurance and freight cif or free on board fob terms 
a significant portion of the company s ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
for retail sales by apb  revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts or when wholesale products are shipped to the customer location 
when the company recognizes revenue  no provisions are made for returns because  historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that have impacted the ultimate collection of revenues 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this 
table of contents interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will be required to adopt fin in the first quarter of fiscal year management does not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires public companies to quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement as material  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered 
the adoption of sab by the company at august  did not have an impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the company will be required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal year management is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas and has not yet determined the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas sfas becomes effective for the company in the first quarter of fiscal year management is currently evaluating the requirements of sfas and has not yet concluded if the fair value option will be adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk the company is exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market price for both ferrous and non ferrous metals which are at times volatile 
see the discussion under the section entitled risk factors industries in which the company operates  are cyclical and demand can be volatile  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
in part i  item a of this report 
the company attempts to mitigate this risk by seeking to turn its inventories quickly rather than holding inventories in speculation of higher commodity prices 
the company s is also exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in the market prices for electricity and natural gas which are at times volatile 
the company s risk strategy associated with the purchase of commodities utilized within its production processes has generally been to make certain commitments with suppliers relating to future expected requirements for such commodities 
the company s gas contract contains provisions which require it to take or pay for specified quantities without regard to actual usage for month periods 
the company s commitments for natural gas with take or pay or other similar commitment provisions for the years ending august are as follows in thousands obligation thereafter total natural gas the company believes that production requirements will be such that consumption of the products or services purchased under these commitments will occur in the normal production process 
the company also purchases the electricity consumed at smb pursuant to a contract which extends through september the contract designates hours annually as interruptible service and establishes an agreed fixed rate energy charge per mill kwh consumed for each year through the expiration of the agreement 
a increase in electricity rates would result in a million impact on fiscal cost of goods sold 

table of contents interest rate risk the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related primarily to our debt obligations 
the company s credit line and revolving credit facility are variable in rate and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates would result in a million impact on fiscal interest expense 
foreign currency risk the company s international operations are subject to foreign exchange rate volatility 
the company s risk strategy is to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk by entering into foreign currency forward contracts related to the expected cash receipts from sales denominated in euros 
the company held foreign currency forward contracts denominated in euros with total notional amounts of million at august  assuming a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar compared with euro at august   the fair value of the company s foreign currency contracts would decrease or increase  respectively by less than million and the company s related derivative liability would increase by the same amount 
it is important to note the increase or decrease in the derivative liability indicated in this sensitivity analysis would be somewhat offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying receivables 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis
