item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to significant  continuing asbestos litigation  as well as other claims and proceedings 
we are subject to numerous lawsuits for asbestos related personal injury  as described more fully in part i  item legal proceedings of this document 
estimation of the company s ultimate exposure for asbestos related claims is subject to significant uncertainties  as there are multiple variables that can affect the timing  severity and quantity of claims 
our estimate of the future expense of these claims is derived from assumptions with respect to future claims  settlement and defense costs which are based on recent experience during the last few years and which may not prove reliable as predictors 
a significant upward or downward trend in the number of claims filed  depending on the nature of the alleged injury  the jurisdiction where filed and the quality of the product identification  or a significant upward or downward trend in the costs of defending claims  could change the estimated liability  as would any substantial adverse verdict at trial 
a legislative solution or a structured settlement transaction could also change the estimated liability 
these uncertainties may result in our incurring future charges or increases to income to adjust the carrying value of recorded liabilities and assets  particularly if the number of claims and settlement and defense costs escalates or if legislation or another alternative solution is implemented  however  we are currently unable to estimate such future changes 
the resolution of these claims may take many years and the effect on results of operations  cash flow and financial position in any given period from a revision to these estimates could be material 
in addition to asbestos lawsuits  we are subject to claims and proceedings relating to the ordinary conduct of our business  such as those involving employment disputes  contract disputes  allegations of infringement on patents and trademarks  personal injuries  product liability and other types of claims 
for more information with respect to the risks to crane co 
associated with asbestos liability and other litigation  see item legal proceedings of this document 
demand for our products is uncertain and subject to factors beyond our control 
in the aerospace and electronics segment  for example  a significant decline in demand for air travel  or a decline in airline profitability generally  could result in reduced orders for aircraft and could also cause airlines to reduce their purchases of repair parts from crane s businesses 
the aerospace businesses could also be impacted if major aircraft manufacturers  such as boeing which represented approximately of the segment s revenue in encountered production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
in the engineered materials segment  sales and profits could fall if there were a decline in demand for truck trailers  recreational vehicles  or industrial or building products 
results in the controls segment could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the oil and gas or heavy truck markets  or from unforeseen product obsolescence 
results at the company s merchandising systems business have been and will continue to be affected by employment levels  office occupancy rates and factors affecting vending operator profitability such as fuel  confection and borrowing costs 
the prices of our raw materials may increase 
in the engineered materials segment  for example  profits could be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs and by any inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their position in product cost and functionality against competing materials 
the costs in the company s fluid handling and merchandising systems segments are affected by fluctuations in the price of metals such as steel 
our ability to obtain parts and raw materials from our suppliers is uncertain 
we are engaged in a continuous  company wide effort to concentrate our purchases of parts and raw materials on fewer suppliers  and to obtain parts from low cost countries where possible 
as this effort progresses  we are exposed to an increased risk of disruptions to our supply chain  which could have a significant effect on our operating results 
we may be unable to identify or to complete acquisitions  or to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire 
we have evaluated  and expect to continue to evaluate  a wide array of potential strategic transactions 
our acquisition program entails the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  and in retaining the employees and integrating the operations of the businesses we acquire 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition opportunities will be available in the future  that the company will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 

table of contents part i item a we face significant competition 
while the company is a principal competitor in most of its markets  all of its markets are highly competitive 
the company s competitors in many of its business segments can be expected in the future to improve technologies  reduce costs and develop and introduce new products  and the ability of the company s business segments to achieve similar advances will be important to their competitive positions 
competitive pressures  including those discussed above  could cause one or more of the company s business segments to lose market share or could result in significant price erosion  either of which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
see the prior discussion included in item under the caption competitive conditions 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside the united states 
net sales and assets related to operations outside the united states were and in  and and in  respectively  of the company s consolidated amounts 
such operations and transactions entail the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risks of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices  adverse trade regulations and possible social  economic and political instability 
our customers businesses are cyclical 
a substantial portion of the sales of our business segments are concentrated in industries that are cyclical 
their results are subject to fluctuations in domestic and international economies as well as to currency fluctuations and unforeseen inflationary pressures 
reductions in the business levels of these industries would reduce the sales and profitability of the affected business segments 
we are dependent on key personnel 
certain of the company s business segments and corporate are dependent upon highly qualified personnel  and the company generally is dependent upon the continued efforts of key management employees 

table of contents part i item a forward looking statements throughout this annual report on form k and the annual report to shareholders  particularly in the letter to shareholders and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the company makes numerous statements about expectations of future performance and market trends and statements about plans and objectives and other matters which because they are not historical fact  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of in addition  the company and its representatives may  from time to time  make written or oral forward looking statements including statements contained in the company s filings with the securities and exchange commission and in its reports to shareholders which can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as believes  contemplates  expects  may  will  could  should  would or anticipates or the negative thereof or comparable terminology 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date on which such statements are made and involve risk and uncertainties that exist in the company s operations and business environment and are not guarantees of future performance 
the company assumes no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information or future events 
readers are cautioned to consider the following important risk factors that could affect the company s businesses and cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
general new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all of such factors 
further  management cannot assess the impact of each such factor on the business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
aerospace electronics a significant fall off in demand for air travel or a decline in airline profitability generally could result in reduced aircraft orders and could also cause the airlines to scale back on more of their purchases of repair parts from the company s businesses 
the businesses could also be impacted if major aircraft manufacturers  such as boeing which represented approximately and of the segment s revenue in and  respectively encountered production problems  or if pricing pressure from aircraft customers caused the manufacturers to press their suppliers to lower prices 
sales and profits could face erosion if pricing pressure from competitors increased  if planned new products were delayed  if finding new aerospace qualified suppliers grew more difficult  or if required technical personnel became harder to hire and retain 
the aerospace electronics segment results could be below expectations if the economy slows  which could cause the us customers to delay or cancel spare parts or aircraft orders 
a portion of this segment s business is conducted under united states government contracts and subcontracts 
these contracts are either competitively bid or sole source contracts 
competitively bid contracts are awarded after a formal bid and proposal competition among suppliers 
sole source contracts are awarded when a single contractor is deemed to have an expertise or technology that is superior to that of competing contractors 
a reduction in congressional appropriations that affect defense spending or the ability of the united states government to terminate its contracts could impact the performance of this business 
engineered materials in the engineered materials segment  sales and profits could fall if there were a decline in demand for truck trailers  recreational vehicles rvs  industrial or building products for which the company s businesses produce fiberglass reinforced panels 
the company experienced a sharp decline in rv orders about midway through the third quarter of as the rv industry sharply curtailed production in response to a fall off in demand from their customers 
the industry generally attributes this downturn to higher gas prices and interest rates and an inventory reduction on dealer lots 
while the short term is uncertain  in the longer term the demographic fundamentals continue to be positive for the growth of rv sales 
profits could also be adversely affected by unanticipated increases in resin and fiberglass material costs  by the loss of a principal supplier or by any inability on the part of the businesses to maintain their product cost and functionality advantages when compared to competing materials 
the company is defending two separate lawsuits brought by customers alleging failure of the company s fiberglass reinforced plastic material in rv sidewalls manufactured by such customers 
the aggregate damages sought in these two lawsuits is approximately million  covering primarily the cost of repairing and replacing the affected sidewalls 
these lawsuits are in early stages of pre trial discovery  and the company believes that it has valid defenses to the claims raised in these lawsuits 
the company has given notice of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers and will seek coverage for any liability in accordance with the applicable policies 
the company is also defending a series of five separate lawsuits  which have now been consolidated  revolving around a fire that occurred in may  at a chicken processing plant located near atlanta  georgia that destroyed the plant 
the aggregate damages demanded by the plaintiff are in excess of million 
these lawsuits contend that certain fiberglass reinforced plastic material manufactured by the company that was installed inside the plant was unsafe in that it acted as an accelerant  causing the fire to spread rapidly  resulting in the total loss of the plant and property 
the suits are in the early stages of pre trial discovery and the company believes that it has valid defenses to the underlying claims raised in these lawsuits 
the company has given notice of these lawsuits to its insurance carriers  and will seek coverage for any resulting losses 
based on a review of its coverage  however  the company has determined that it is facing a potential million gap in insurance coverage  for the layer of insurance which would have provided protection for losses above million but below million 
the company has initiated certain actions aimed at closing the gap in insurance coverage 
if the plaintiffs in these lawsuits were to prevail at trial and be awarded the full extent of their claimed damages  and the gap in coverage was not closed  the 
table of contents part i item b resulting liability could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows in the periods affected 
merchandising systems results at the company s us based vending machine business could be reduced by unfavorable economic or market conditions  delays in launching or supplying new products or an inability to achieve new product sales objectives 
results at the company s german based coin validation machine business have been and will continue to be affected by unforeseen fluctuations in the value of the euro or other european currencies versus the us dollar 
the company made four acquisitions in its merchandising systems segment in  two of which are in vending machine manufacturing and two of which manufacture payment systems 
the results of this segment could be adversely affected if unexpected problems are experienced in the integration of these businesses 
in addition  one of the acquired vending machine manufacturers is currently experiencing operating losses  and the company anticipates that it will take a number of months to implement the necessary changes to business practices of the acquired company in order to return it to profitability 
fluid handling the company s businesses could face increased price competition from larger competitors 
slowing of the economy or major markets could reduce sales and profits  particularly if projects for which these businesses are suppliers or bidders are cancelled or delayed 
furthermore  as the company continues to outsource from international sources  particularly low cost countries  the risk of supply chain issues increases 
at the company s foreign operations  reported results in us dollars could be eroded by an unanticipated weakening of the local currency of the respective operations 
the company has been engaged in discussions with attorneys from the civil division of the us justice department regarding allegations that certain valves sold by the company s crane valves north america unit cvna to private customers that ultimately were delivered to us military agencies did not conform to certain contractual specifications relating to the place of manufacture and the origin of component parts 
these discussions relate to i the alleged failure by cvna to notify the correct us military agency when its manufacturing location for mil spec valves listed on the qualified products list was moved from long beach  california to conroe  texas in  and ii the alleged delivery of mil spec valves with certain component parts containing specialty steel that was not melted or produced in the united states or a qualifying country as required by federal law the so called berry amendment 
the allegations do not question the quality of the valves or the component parts  nor is any intentional misconduct alleged 
the company believes that cvna satisfied its notice obligations regarding the relocation of its manufacturing facility  and its investigation of the alleged berry amendment violation has revealed that the component value of the relevant parts contained within mil spec valves sold by cvna within the past five years was approximately  the justice department has stated to the company that cvna s alleged noncompliance with these contract terms represents a violation of the civil false claims act  that the potential measure of damages could be the invoice price of the valves rather than the component cost of noncompliant parts and that under the false claims act such damages may be trebled 
the justice department has asserted that the potential damages on this basis could exceed million 
the company disputes this position  which to the company s knowledge would be an unprecedented application of the false claims act  and the company maintains that these are contract administration issues  not false claims 
while the company has been engaged in discussions with the justice department in an effort to resolve the matter  the justice department has indicated that it intends to pursue recovery through the courts 
if the justice department were to prevail with its theories of liability and damages  the resulting judgment could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows in the periods affected 
the company received a letter from the department of the navy on february   conveying the department s concerns about the alleged qualified products list violation that has been under discussion with the department of justice referenced above 
the department of the navy has advised the company that if this allegation is true  it could potentially result in the company and its subsidiaries and affiliates being suspended and or debarred from doing business with the us government 
the company intends to respond timely to the department s letter  and to cooperate fully with the department in an effort to address the department s concerns 
the company believes that when the department of the navy has concluded its examination of the factual record  the company s position will be confirmed 
controls a number of factors could affect the controls segment s results 
lower sales and earnings could result if the control s businesses cannot maintain their cost competitiveness  encounter delays in introducing new products or fail to achieve their new product sales objectives 
results could decline because of an unanticipated decline in demand for the businesses products from the industrial machinery  oil and gas or heavy equipment industries  or from unforeseen product obsolescence

the electronics group experienced flat sales year over year 
in the engineered materials segment  demand for fiberglass reinforced panels from the recreational vehicle and transportation trailer markets was up slightly for the year 
the merchandising systems segment showed a million revenue increase in mainly from the four acquisitions made during the year 
excluding acquisitions  vending solutions revenue declined reflecting the weak vending machine market conditions throughout which appeared to stabilize at the end of the year 
the fluid handling segment s sales increased million  or  including a net decline of million from disposed and acquired businesses 
excluding dispositions and acquisitions  this segment s sales increased million  or  million from core growth and million from favorable foreign exchange reflecting the strong conditions in general industrial markets 
total operating profit was million higher  or  in than in the prior year  largely the result of favorable performance in the fluid handling segment and the aerospace group 
all segments except engineered materials showed improvement 
fluid handling benefited from operational improvements  the leverage on higher sales volume and price increases in in the aerospace and electronics segment  the electronics group operating profit was down slightly  but the aerospace group experienced a profit improvement from the strong increase in commercial oem and aftermarket sales 
the merchandising systems segment s profit from acquisitions was somewhat offset by lower volume on traditional vending products 
operating margins improved to in from in this increase was mostly due to the fluid handling segment s strong performance and aerospace group s favorable volume and mix 
the aerospace group mix of oem aftermarket was improved year over year reflecting program wins for modernization and upgrade and initial provisioning on new aircraft 
these improvements were somewhat offset by the unfavorable margins at engineered materials largely from the cost of customer assistance payments and  in the electronics group  from the costs associated with increased engineering investment and the mix of lower margin contracts 
miscellaneous income was up million pretax in from primarily from the million net gain from the sale of resistoflex aerospace and westad 
net income was million per diluted share in  an increase of  as compared with million per diluted share in compared with sales in increased million  or  to billion compared with billion in the sales increase was primarily due to core business growth of million  or

the fluid handling segment s sales increased million  or  and included sales of million from acquisitions  a million decline from a disposition  and favorable foreign exchange of million 
excluding acquisitions  dispositions and foreign exchange  this segment s sales increased  reflecting the improved conditions in general industrial markets 
total segment operating profit was million  or  higher in than in the prior year  and reflected improvement in four of the five operating segments 
higher sales from price increases and transportation market growth  in addition to operational improvement initiatives  led to increased operating profit in the engineered materials segment 
productivity gains from cost reduction activities  including negotiated procurement savings  outsourcing and value engineering  led to the operating profit increase in the merchandising systems segment 
fluid handling operating profit benefited from pricing initiatives to offset raw material cost increases first experienced in  as well as lean manufacturing initiatives 
aerospace group operating profit was up slightly from last year  while the electronics group experienced lower operating profit due to lower margin and loss contracts  and operating inefficiencies 
this led to an overall decrease in operating profit in the aerospace electronics segment 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations segment operating margins increased to from in this increase was mostly due to price increases and productivity improvements experienced in the engineered materials and fluid handling segments and cost reduction activities in the merchandising systems segment 
the increase was somewhat offset by the unfavorable margins at the aerospace group from mix  right sizing and new product development costs and  in the electronics group  from the costs associated with operating difficulties and lower margin and loss contracts

asbestos charge in october  the company reached an agreement in principle with representatives of a majority of then current claimants and an independent representative of future claimants to resolve all current and future asbestos related personal injury claims against the company  to be structured and implemented pursuant to section g of the us bankruptcy code 
mcc holdings  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company formerly known as mark controls corporation mcc  entered into a master settlement agreement msa with representatives of a majority of then current claimants and a settlement trust agreement  providing for a million trust to be funded and administered to pay asbestos related personal injury claims settled under the msa 
in connection with the terms of the msa  which would have brought finality to this overall obligation  a third quarter asbestos charge of million pre tax and after insurance was recorded 
on december   the united states court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the district court order approving combustion engineering s asbestos related bankruptcy plan of reorganization and addressed the scope of section g and the appropriate structure of transactions providing relief for asbestos defendant companies under section g 
the court s opinion  in the company s view  constituted a material change in the case law regarding section g transactions  and accordingly  on january   the company exercised its right to terminate the msa 
the termination of the msa placed the company and asbestos claimants back into the tort system for the resolution of claims 
in the fourth quarter of  crane co 
management  with the assistance of outside experts  made its best estimate of settlement and defense costs through including certain related fees and expenses 
the estimated asbestos liability was reviewed in light of these changes and resulted in a million reduction to estimated cost after anticipated insurance recoveries  but before taxes  in the fourth quarter of crane co

see segment information on page overview the aerospace electronics segment has two groups  the aerospace group and the electronics group  each structured as one company to reduce operating costs  eliminate duplication of overhead and capital expenditures  leverage and share intellectual capital  improve focus on customer solutions and provide the structure for efficient integration of acquisitions 
in  segment revenue was derived from the aerospace group and from the electronics group 
the aerospace group products are currently manufactured under the brand names hydro aire  eldec  lear romac and pl porter porter 
the group s products are organized into the following solution sets landing systems  sensing and utility systems  fluid management  aircraft electrical power and cabin 
the electronics group products are currently manufactured under the brand names interpoint  eldec  keltec  stc microwave systems  olektron and general technology 
the group s products are organized into the following solution sets power  microwave systems  electronic manufacturing services and microelectronics 
resistoflex aerospace  a manufacturer of high performance hose and high pressure fittings with annual sales of million in  was sold in may after it was determined that this solution set did not have sufficient strategic links with other crane product offerings 
the company continues to focus on deploying capital in businesses where it is better able to leverage its presence and customers 

table of contents part ii item porter  acquired in late january for a purchase price of million  holds leading positions in both electromechanical actuation and hydraulic mechanical actuation for aircraft seating  selling directly to seat manufacturers and to the airlines 
this solution set s products are the aerospace electronics segment s first offerings for passenger service applications 
compared with sales of the aerospace electronics segment increased million  or  in to million including a decline of million from the may sale of resistoflex aerospace 
the sales growth of this segment was entirely from the results of the aerospace group 
the aerospace electronics operating profit increase was million  or  in aerospace group operating profit increased significantly on higher volume  favorable oem aftermarket mix and productivity improvements  while electronics operating profit was down largely from reduced contract profitability and higher engineering investments 
the operating margin for the segment was in compared to in aerospace group aerospace group sales increased from million in to million in resistoflex aerospace sales were million during for the period through the may divestiture compared with million in annual revenue in aerospace group sales increased excluding resistoflex aerospace 
backlog at december  rose excluding resistoflex aerospace to million from december  due to strong program wins in the favorable aerospace environment 
the commercial market accounted for about of aerospace group sales in  while sales to the military market were approximately of the total sales 
sales in by the group s five solution sets were as follows landing systems   sensing and utility systems   fluid management   aircraft electrical power   and cabin  
the aerospace group s sales increased due to higher commercial oem and aftermarket volumes in higher sales of commercial oem and aftermarket products were fueled by the strong growth in the aerospace industry with a near record level of commercial and a record level of business jet aircraft builds in sales to oem were of the total in compared with in the strong aircraft build rate along with the company s program wins was a significant factor in this overall growth 
successful modernization and upgrade programs and repair and overhaul for the existing aircraft fleet and higher initial provisioning for new aircraft placed in service resulted in the strong aftermarket performance 
the aerospace group operating profit increased over the prior year from the higher volume and improved aftermarket oem mix 
in addition  the aerospace group benefited in from lower costs from site consolidation and higher capacity utilization which was partly offset by a higher investment in engineering 
in  engineering development costs increased approximately over prior year levels 
the aerospace group continued to invest engineering resources in new technology and new markets with an emphasis on products that improve safety and or reduce operating costs 
the aerospace group continued to invest significantly for both short and long term growth 
this included short development cycle investment in modernization and upgrade programs using existing  off the shelf products to improve safety and operating costs for in service aircraft 
long development cycle investments were for existing products on new aircraft platforms  the upgrade of current customers and displacement of incumbents on existing aircraft  as well as new products for both in service aircraft and new aircraft platforms including wireless technologies and airweighs airweighs 
our wireless smartstem system introduced in replaces the existing valve stem in an aircraft wheel with a radio frequency equipped valve stem capability for communicating tire pressure  temperature and other stored data wirelessly 
the ease of use of the smartstem system reduces labor costs and helps in keeping tires properly inflated extending tire life 
the airweighs system converts landing gear struts into scales that measure an aircraft s weight and determine the center of gravity in seconds  versus the older method that calculates this information using average passenger weights 
automatically measuring aircraft weight and center of gravity information improves airline operations and enhances aircraft performance and safety 
improved working capital levels were demonstrated by the aerospace group s quicker inventory turns  improved days sales outstanding for receivables and overall lower working capital as a percentage of sales at in compared with in electronics group in  electronics group sales of million were about even with sales 
the electronics group was favorably impacted by the strength of the network centric warfare defense market in replacement and modification programs which helped to overcome revenue reductions in some heritage markets  particularly the contract manufacturing business electronic manufacturing solutions 
operating profit declined by million from reduced contract profitability and higher engineering investment 
electronics group sales by market in were as follows military defense  commercial aerospace  medical  space 
sales in by the group s solution sets were as follows power   microwave systems   microelectronics   and electronic manufacturing  
power solution s revenue was strong in  up from operating profit margins in power solutions declined by because of increased investment in research and development on commercial aerospace programs as well as margin erosion from higher program costs on certain contracts 
the markets for power products showed good strength in commercial aerospace production gained momentum and traditional military defense customers pursued modernization and upgrade programs for existing platforms and remained focused on aircraft maintenance as new aircraft acquisitions slipped out into future years 
at december   the backlog was up from prior year levels 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations microwave systems solution s revenues were approximately lower than the markets for microwave products showed softness in as defense operations and maintenance logistic budgets shifted to fund the war on terrorism 
operating profit declined from from the impact of the lower volume and higher mix of lower margin contracts partly offset by emphasis on spending reductions and improved program performance 
at december   the backlog was down as compared to year end microelectronics solutions supports biomedical and commercial customers with unique solutions to their requirements 
microelectronics experienced strong growth in electronics for implantable biomedical devices in and is pursing defense microelectronics applications for future growth opportunities as well 
backlog at december  was above prior year levels 
electronic manufacturing solutions supports defense customers with engineered and build to print electronics manufacturing services 
the electronic manufacturing solutions set experienced a decline in revenues in and had continued operational and business challenges resulting in an operating loss in backlog at december  was below prior year levels 
compared with sales of the aerospace electronics segment increased million  or  in to million 
operating profit declined million  or 
aerospace group operating profit was up slightly  and electronics group operating profit declined because of the dilutive effect of lower margin and loss contracts and operating inefficiencies 
the operating margin for the segment was in compared with in  reflecting the electronics group s performance difficulties and the aerospace group s oem aftermarket mix  higher engineering investment to support current and future sales  and additional costs for facility closure and workforce reductions 
for the segment  operating working capital as a percent of sales improved to at december  compared with at december  aerospace group aerospace group sales increased by  from million in to million in sales growth reflected a strong increase in oem demand and  to a lesser extent  higher aftermarket volume and incremental revenue of million from the early acquisition of the porter seat actuation business 
operating profit was up slightly in  when compared with  as increased earnings from strong oem sales and increased high margin aftermarket business were partly offset by the cost of workforce reductions  facility consolidations and increased engineering investment for new aircraft programs 
the commercial market accounted for about of aerospace group sales in  while sales to the military market were approximately of the total 
sales in by the group s five solution sets were as follows landing systems   sensing and controls   fluid management   aircraft electrical power   and cabin  
the aerospace group s core business shipments to oem customers in increased above as a result of a significant increase in demand from the commercial market 
aftermarket sales in increased slightly compared with sales to oems were of the total in compared with in in  the aerospace group continued to invest in new technology and new markets with an emphasis on products that improve safety and or reduce operating costs 
one new product is the hand held smartstem system introduced in  which replaces the existing valve stem in an aircraft wheel with a radio frequency equipped valve stem capable of communicating tire pressure  temperature and other stored data wirelessly 
the ease of use of the smartstem system reduces labor costs and helps in keeping tires properly inflated extending tire life 
smartstem has been selected by a major manufacturer for the business jet market using a handheld system and by boeing for the commercial aircraft using an on board system 
another product under development is a weight and balance system airweighs 
the airweighs system converts landing gear struts into scales that measure an aircraft s weight and determine the center of gravity in seconds  versus the older method that calculates this information using average passenger and baggage weights 
automatically measuring actual aircraft weight and center of gravity information improves airline operations and enhances aircraft performance while focusing on safety 
the company is working with customers to incorporate this product into their aircraft 
in  the aerospace group established the cabin systems solution set with the acquisition of porter 
in  the aerospace group completed a facility consolidation of the porter woodland hills  california  site into the hydro aire burbank  california  site to further improve the combined profitability of these units 
electronics group in  electronics group sales increased to million from million in operating profit declined by 
the group faced operational challenges including meeting increased power solutions customer demand and the effect of lower margin and loss contracts in electronic manufacturing solutions and microwave solutions systems 
however  margins showed significant improvement in the second half of electronics group sales by market in were as follows military defense   commercial aerospace   medical   and space  
sales in by the group s solution sets were as follows power   microwave systems   electronic manufacturing   and microelectronics  
power solution s revenue growth during was strong at 
operating profit margins in power solutions remained strong  the strongest for all product lines in the electronics group 
backlog at december   was above prior year levels 
microwave systems solution s revenue growth during was 
operating profit was down compared with and was impacted by costs associated with manufacturing throughput issues 
backlog at december   was above prior year levels 

table of contents part ii item electronics manufacturing solution s revenue declined and had operational and business challenges resulting in an operating loss in backlog at december   was below prior year levels because of weak orders 
microelectronics solutions provides electronic solutions to the biomedical industry 
revenue was up slightly from backlog at december   nearly doubled from prior year levels from strong orders 
outlook for  management expects the segment to show a modest increase in sales and operating profit with improved margins in both the aerospace group and the electronics group 
the continued strong demand for commercial aircraft from another record year of aircraft build rates  in both the large commercial and business jet markets  coupled with higher levels of aftermarket sales from modernization and upgrade programs and traditional commercial spares are expected to drive both revenue growth and margin improvement for the aerospace group in higher engineering investment for both short and long cycle development programs are expected to temper margin improvement in in the electronics group  sales are expected to be approximately flat in with modest improvement in operating margin resulting from productivity improvements and higher margins on customer contracts 
engineered materials dollars in millions net sales operating profit assets operating margin overview the engineered materials segment is largely made up of the crane composites fiberglass reinforced plastic frp panel business  but it also includes polyflon  a small specialty component business 
crane composites is the world s largest manufacturer of frp panels for rv  truck trailers  building products and industrial building materials 
polyflon s small  specialty components are used primarily as substrate materials for antennas 
noble composites  inc noble  a manufacturer of high gloss exterior finish products for rv sidewalls was acquired on september  for a purchase price of million in cash 
this acquisition broadened crane composites product offering to the rv industry to include premium  high gloss finished composite panels for use by motor home and travel trailer manufacturers 
noble had annual sales of million in and was successfully integrated into crane composites in the fourth quarter of adding million in sales 
compared with engineered materials sales increased by million from million in to million in operating profit declined by million from million in to million in operating margins were in compared with in increased sales from the noble acquisition and price increases across all markets were partially offset by lower volume  primarily in the rv market and europe 
the industry had rv shipments of  units in which was up slightly from record levels  but significant weakness was experienced in the second half of the year 
rv shipments were dramatically curtailed late in the third quarter of as original equipment manufacturers oems adjusted their production levels due to lower retail sales 
building products sales increased due to stronger commercial construction markets along with increased sales of design solution decorative panel products 
in  the higher design solution sales level reflected the resources added to focus on working with architects and designers leading to increased product acceptance and specification of crane composites decorative panels in certain projects 
sales of interior scuff and liner panels for transportation trailers increased slightly in compared with sales in latin america and asia were higher in than from strong demand for truck bodies and containers along with building products 
the operating profit decline was primarily due to the lower rv volume  customer assistance costs associated with rv panel distortion and slightly higher material costs partly offset by profit contribution from the september noble acquisition and customer price increases across all product lines 
in  product support has been provided to several rv customers experiencing panel distortion 
distortion affects the exterior panels of rvs and has been caused  in the company s view  by either a poor gluing process of the frp panels to the substrate material and or a higher than normal moisture content in the substrate materials  which is typically a plywood type material called luan 
crane composites embarked on a customer assistance program to team with the oems to provide solutions to the industry wide distortion problem 
the root causes and actions to address these issues involve teams of our production employees and technical experts along with our customers who are reviewing production methods including adhesive processes  substrate sources and inspection processes 
strong working capital management continued to show positive results 
working capital as a percentage of sales was in as compared with in polyflon had sales of approximately million in with an operating profit margin of 
compared with engineered materials sales increased by million  or  from million in to million in operating profit increased by million from million in to million in operating margins were in compared with in 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in  crane composites sales increased  while operating profit increased 
sales of frp panels to the rv market were up  primarily due to price increases implemented in the latter half of and the first quarter of demand remained high in the rv market  as  units were built in  higher than the twenty five year record setting build rate of  units in sales of translucent roofs and interior scuff and liner panels for transportation trailers increased in compared with  as frp panels continued to displace traditional materials 
crane composites sales to the transportation market also benefited from price increases and incremental sales generated by an innovative new product  armortuf  a high performance  lightweight  extremely impact resistant liner panel 
in addition  sales of frp design solutions  decorative products for the commercial building market  also increased 
operating margins improved in primarily as a result of price increases to keep pace with the rise in raw material costs as well as operating efficiencies related to operational excellence programs  particularly higher manufacturing yield on materials 
in addition to cost reduction programs and operational excellence  the discipline of the strategic deployment process helped to drive improved profitability and working capital efficiencies 
the working capital investment level was reduced to of sales in compared with in and on time delivery remained very high at 
polyflon had sales of million with operating profit margins of in outlook the engineered materials segment sales are expected to increase in from the full year impact of the noble acquisition  customer price increases to offset material cost escalation and building products market growth 
however  a market decline for rv and transportation is anticipated in longer term  business fundamentals continue to be positive for these markets due to continued displacement of traditional materials by frp 
through our partnership with rv customers  improvements have been made to their processes and we have introduced a new product  giii  which is more resistant to distortion 
in  a lower level of customer assistance costs is anticipated 
raw material pricing is expected to moderate in operating margins are expected to improve in largely from the full year impact of the noble acquisition  improved manufacturing efficiencies and lower customer support costs 
as reported by the recreational vehicle industry association rvia shipment report dated december merchandising systems dollars in millions net sales operating profit assets operating margin overview the merchandising systems segment is an industry leader in the design  manufacture and distribution of a full line of food  snack and hot and cold beverage vending machines and payment solution products 
the merchandising systems product portfolio of equipment  payment systems and vending management software creates an enterprise solution for customers 
the segment is divided into two groups  vending solutions and payment solutions both of which were significantly expanded in with the company s investment of over million for the acquisitions of four complementary businesses 
the expanded customer base  geographic presence and product portfolio can be mutually leveraged by all of these businesses 
vending solutions brands include dixie narco  national vendors  automatic products  gpl  stentorfield and streamware 
these products create customer value through innovation  reliability  durability and reduced cost of ownership 
automated merchandising equipment is sold to vending operators and food and beverage companies throughout the world 
vending solutions has leading positions in both the direct and indirect distribution channels 
streamware provides vending management software to help customers operate their businesses more profitably  become more competitive and free cash for continued business investment 
major production facilities for vending solutions are located in st 
louis  missouri  williston  south carolina  and chippenham  england 
crane acquired two vending solutions businesses in in october  crane acquired of the shares of dixie narco for approximately million 
dixie narco is the largest can bottle merchandising equipment manufacturer in the world 
primary customers are the major soft drink companies  in addition  equipment is marketed to global vending operators 
adding a cold beverage vending equipment product line through this acquisition was a key strategy as nearly of all vending machines on location are soft drink and snack machines 
prior to this acquisition  crane did not have a cold beverage vending equipment product in its portfolio 
the dixie narco acquisition not only expanded vending capabilities  it enabled synergies for new product development  and reinforced the company s industry leadership position 
in  dixie narco had annual sales of million and a significant operating loss 
planned post acquisition benefits include market and product development synergies and increased efficiencies through operational excellence 
these and other business practice changes are expected to yield breakeven results in with further improvement expected in the future 
certain assets of st 
paul  minnesota based automatic products international ap were purchased in mid and late for 
table of contents part ii item approximately million 
ap is a business leader in vending products sold primarily through a dealer channel of distribution 
the acquisition is complementary with the other businesses in this segment and will enable stronger penetration of market channels  market segments and geographic areas 
vending customers will receive better value through a larger choice of products  source of supply and service 
ap equipment production has been consolidated into the company s previously owned merchandising systems facility in st 
louis  missouri 
payment solutions includes national rejectors nri  which is based in germany and makes coin changers and validators  and two new businesses acquired in  telequip and cash code 
with the acquisition of these two businesses  crane is now a full line supplier of high technology payment systems products well positioned for growth in all market segments and geographies 
the payment solutions group is expected to become a larger proportion of the merchandising segment as a result of these acquisitions and their anticipated growth rate 
telequip  a manufacturer of coin dispensing solutions since  was acquired by crane in june for approximately million 
telequip manufactures coin dispensing systems used in a variety of standalone applications such as supermarkets  convenience stores and quick service restaurants  and this equipment continues to be incorporated into the rapidly growing self checkout and kiosk equipment markets 
telequip had total annual sales of approximately million in in january  crane acquired cashcode co 
inc cash code for approximately million in cash 
cash code manufactures banknote validators  storage and recycling devices for use in a variety of niche applications in the vending  gaming  retail and transportation industries 
cash code had annual sales of approximately million in nri is headquartered in buxetehude  germany  cash code is in concord  ontario  canada and kiev  ukraine  and telequip in salem  new hampshire 
compared with merchandising systems segment sales of million increased million from mainly due to the incremental revenue from the four acquisitions 
operating profit of million increased million in as the profits from acquisitions more than offset the impact on earnings from integration of certain acquisitions and the downturn in the vending market and the related cost of downsizing 
the vending solutions sales increase was mainly due to the incremental revenue from the ap and dixie narco acquisitions 
however  the vending market suffered in as vending operators margins were affected by increased consumable product costs as well as higher fuel costs which caused a volume decline in the existing business 
the market downturn began in the second half of and appeared to stabilize at the end of the vending solutions group operating results included approximately million of severance costs needed to right size employment levels given the prolonged market downturn as well as certain operating losses and integration costs from our recently acquired dixie narco and ap businesses 
the payment solutions group revenue and profit increase was primarily from the cash code and telequip acquisitions  which were both accretive in  while the nri coin changer and validation business also showed favorable results 
compared with segment sales were down slightly in at million when compared with including favorable foreign currency translation of million 
operating profit increased to million  or  from million in vending solutions sales of million were down from million in industry wide demand for vending machines was weak in the second half of the softer sales reflect route operators lower profitability from higher gas prices and confectionary food costs and continued weakness in end markets  in part  from hurricane disruption 
operating profit declined as the effect of the reduced sales volume in vending was partly offset by effective control of costs  including negotiated procurement savings  headcount reductions and value engineering 
softer sales also contributed to an increase in working capital from of sales in to in vending solutions concentrated on operational excellence to significantly improve both customer focus and operations 
on time deliveries were maintained at a very high rate of in and in the payment solutions nri business had net sales in of million  up  when compared with sales of million 
major factors in the improvement were increased sales of coin changers into the us and improved demand in europe 
nri had a profitable year in versus a million operating loss in the additional sales  an improved cost structure from headcount reductions and lower severance costs accounted for the increase in operating profit 
outlook in  strong sales and profit growth are expected as a result of the impact of full year operations from the acquisitions in both vending solutions and payment solutions 
continued emphasis on operational excellence  cost reductions and pricing discipline are expected to drive improvements as the acquisitions become integrated into the merchandising systems segment 
in addition  selling  product  manufacturing and engineering synergies are expected to show benefits in both the near and longer term 
fluid handling dollars in millions net sales operating profit assets operating margin reclassified to reflect the movement of environmental to the controls segment 
see segment information on page overview the fluid handling segment consists of the valve group  crane pumps systems and crane supply 
the valve group was expanded in to include crane limited and resistoflex industrial  two businesses that were previously part of the fluid handling segment but not part of the valve group 
the valve group manufactures and sells various types of industrial and commercial valves  corrosion resistant plastic lined pipe  pipe fittings  couplings  connectors and actuators and provides valve testing  parts and services

crane pumps systems manufactures and sells pumps and pressure sewer systems for a wide range of applications and crane supply is a canadian distributor of pipe  valves and fittings 
in april  the company completed the sale of its westad specialty valve business in norway westad 
westad had annual revenues of million in from the sales of large valves used in ship building 
this business had no strategic links with other crane products offerings and experienced several years of poor operating performance prior to its sale 
the company continues to focus on deploying capital in businesses where it is better able to leverage its presence and customers 
in august  the company acquired the business and selected assets of the psi division of edlon  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of robbins myers  inc psi is a manufacturer of plastic lined pipes  fittings and accessories 
in december  the company sold the victaulic trademark and related assets  acquired in connection with the acquisition of certain valve and fittings product lines from etex sa group in for million in an all cash transaction 
the company realized an after tax gain of million  or 
per share  on the sale 
in january  the company acquired the hattersley valve brand and business for million  from a subsidiary of tomkins plc  whose branded products included an array of valves for commercial  industrial and institutional construction projects 
the fluid handling segment experienced strong sales growth attaining a billion sales level in from million in  an increase over this three year period 
operating profit doubled for the same three year period  and margins improved from in to in  with a continuous drive towards lean manufacturing across all business units increasing efficiency and profitability 
demand for most of fluid handling s industrial products  which is mainly driven by the chemical and pharmaceutical  oil and gas  power  bio fuels and mining markets  remained strong during all three years 
refineries increased spending in both and to keep up with the demand for gasoline 
refineries have been running at full capacity without planned shutdowns  resulting in a higher project to mro maintenance  repair and overhaul mix and a build up of a future shutdown maintenance opportunity 
product demand from alternative fuel markets has also increased  partly due to incentives to reduce us dependence on foreign oil and state legislation to replace certain fuel additives with ethanol 
the fluid handling segment continued to show improved capital efficiency with inventory turns of at december   at december  and at december   while working capital as a percentage of sales was at december   at december  and at december  compared with fluid handling sales of billion increased million  or  from million in the sales increase includes million from growth of core businesses and million  or  from favorable currency translation 
additionally  these amounts were partly offset by a net decline of million  or  from the april westad disposition and august psi acquisition 
backlog was million at december   up from million at december  excluding westad  backlog was up in from million at december  fluid handling segment revenue in was derived as follows valve group   crane pumps systems   crane supply

these improvements included increased low cost sourcing  facility consolidations and improved pricing discipline 
operating margin was in compared with in valve group sales increased to million in from million in the sales improvement was derived as follows million from growth of core businesses  million  or  from favorable currency translation  partly offset by a net decline of million  or  from the westad disposition and psi acquisition 
the valve group revenue growth was due to strong sales for ethanol plant construction and oil and gas applications at crane valves north america and chemical and pharmaceutical programs at xomox and resistoflex 
in addition  valve services benefited from a contract awarded by a buying consortium of nuclear power plants at the end of and crane ltd 
experienced a marked increase in export sales 
the valve group continued to experience increases in material costs  led by a significant rise in the cost of bronze ingot  however  improved pricing discipline resulted in appropriate sales price increases to minimize this impact 
operating profit of million increased million  or  above operating profit of million 
the improved profitability resulted from the higher sales level  improved capacity utilization  facility consolidations and increased sourcing from low cost country suppliers 
crane pumps systems revenue increased to million slightly ahead of while operating profit increased with the organization benefiting from the closure of the manufacturing facility in salem  ohio and customer price increases 
crane supply revenue increased million to million  a increase from million in largely due to favorable foreign exchange 
sales growth from new construction starts in the industrial  commercial and institutional markets combined with the growth in the petrochemical market was offset by a softening in the manufacturing sector 
commodity prices stabilized in while operating margins improved above from leveraging gross margin disciplines and pricing management across the organization 
compared with fluid handling sales of million increased million  or  from million in the sales gain was derived as follows million from growth of core businesses and million from favorable currency translation which was partly offset by a net million decrease from the absence of victaulic  which was sold at the end of  and the psi acquisition 
core business growth was driven by industrial valve volume growth and sales price increases 
operating profit of million in increased million  or  compared with million in this increase is primarily a result of the higher revenue  increased operating efficiencies  continued migration towards low cost country sourcing and pricing increases

valve group sales of million increased million  or  from million in sales growth was million  or  from core businesses and from favorable foreign currency translation and a net decline of from dispositions and acquisitions 
the revenue increase in the valve group was primarily due to the increased project business across all end markets at xomox  strong power market demand and improved sales of china sourced cast steel product at crane valves north america 
in addition  the company s marine valve unit was successful in implementing price increases and crane process flow technologies had strong project growth in crane ltd 
experienced strong core growth from higher export and building product sales while the sales gain by resistoflex was due to the sales from psi which was acquired in the third quarter of valve group operating profit of million in increased million  or  compared with million in  reflecting increased sales  improvement in the marine valve business  the impact from the recent acquisitions and overall improved operating costs 
valve group inventory turns have improved to at december  from at december   while working capital as a percentage of sales was at december  compared with at december  crane pumps systems revenues increased to million  or  from million in growth was driven by a record year in the government market with a strong order trend 
there was continued growth in water waste water and specialty valve areas and successful new product initiatives in the professional plumbing and pressure sewer product lines 
these gains were partially negated by declines in our traditional professional plumbing products due to drought conditions across many areas of the country 
significant price increases implemented over the past months fully countered higher material costs 
despite the revenue growth  operating profit decreased from million in to million in salem  ohio facility closure expenses accounted for million of the million decline 
quality costs  primarily related to the decorative water feature product line produced at the company s china joint venture  and unfavorable product and customer mix  also reduced operating profit 
disruption and inefficiencies resulting from the salem facility closure caused added costs in the operating inefficiencies were aggressively addressed and largely remedied in the second half of benefits from these actions along with the full benefit of the salem consolidation are expected to be realized in crane supply revenues increased million to million  or a increase from million in  due to continued growth in two key customer segments  contractors and industrial mro 
continued growth in new construction starts  primarily in the industrial  commercial and institutional segments  and strong mro activity in the mining and petrochemical markets continued through operating profit margin was relatively unchanged at nearly as price increases kept pace with the cost of core commodities 
outlook management expects increased sales and operating profit in from continued favorable market conditions coupled with operating improvements and efficiencies 
the fluid handling segment will integrate certain crane valve group companies through reorganization by end market  streamlining the front end and eliminating duplication 
in  margin improvement is expected from the benefits of the improved productivity and cost structure of the valve group reorganization and the continuation of disciplined pricing  operational excellence and expanded low cost sourcing at all of the fluid handling businesses
