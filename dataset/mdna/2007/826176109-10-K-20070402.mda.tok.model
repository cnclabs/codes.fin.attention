the market was stronger in due to steady interest rates and declining oil prices although our customer trading activity was flat 
competition continued to intensify among all types of brokerage firms  including established discount brokers and new firms entering the on line brokerage business 
electronic trading continues to account for an increasing amount of trading activity  with some firms charging very low trading execution fees that are difficult for any conventional discount firm to meet 
some of these brokers  however  impose asset based charges for services such as mailing  transfers and handling exchanges which we do not currently impose  and also direct their orders to market makers where they have a financial interest 
continued competition could limit our growth or even lead to a decline in our customer base  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
industry wide changes in trading practices  such as the new york stock exchange s hybrid market proposal and the increasing use of electronic communications networks  are expected to put continuing pressure on commissions fees earned by brokers while increasing volatility 
we entered into an operating agreement  effective as of april  the operating agreement  with suzanne shank and napolean brandford iii  the two individual principals of sbs the principals of sbs financial products company llc  a delaware limited liability company sbsfpc

under this program  shares are purchased from time to time  at our discretion  in the open market and in private transactions 
through march    shares have been purchased at an average price of per share 
we  like other securities firms  are directly affected by general economic and market conditions including fluctuations in volume and prices of securities  changes and the prospect of changes in interest rates  and demand for brokerage and investment banking services  all of which can affect our profitability 
in addition  in periods of reduced financial market activity  profitability is likely to be adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed  including salaries and related costs  portions of communications costs and occupancy expenses 
accordingly  earnings for any period should not be considered representative of earnings to be expected for any other period

critical accounting policies we generally follow accounting policies standard in the brokerage industry and believe that our policies appropriately reflect our financial position and results of operations 
our management makes significant estimates that effect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contigent assets and liabilities included in the financial statements 
the estimates relate primarily to revenue and expense items in the normal course of business as to which we receive no confirmations  invoices  or other documentation  at the time the books are closed for a period 
we use our best judgment  based on our knowledge of revenue transactions and expenses incurred  to estimate the amount of such revenue and expenses 
we are not aware of any material differences between the estimates used in closing our books for the last five years and the actual amounts of revenue and expenses incurred when we subsequently receive the actual confirmations  invoices or other documentation 
estimates are also used in determining the useful lives of intangibles assets  and the fair market value of intangible assets 
our management believes that its estimates are reasonable
