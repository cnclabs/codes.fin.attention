restatement of consolidated financial statements and stock option investigation on june   we announced that a committee of independent directors of the board of directors the special committee assisted by independent legal counsel and outside accounting experts was conducting an independent investigation to review our historical stock option grant practices and related accounting 
the special committee and their advisors conducted an extensive review of our historical stock option grants and related accounting  including an assessment and review of our accounting policies  internal records  supporting documentation and e mail communications  as well as interviews with current and former employees and current and former members of our executive management and board of directors 
the special committee has determined that the exercise price of a substantial number of stock option grants during the periods between through march  differed from the fair market value of the underlying shares on the measurement date 
in most cases  the original date assigned to the grant corresponded to the date as of which a unanimous written consent uwc was executed by the members of the compensation committee of our board of directors  but the date of that consent did not correspond to the actual date on which the identities of the individual optionees and the number of shares underlying each option was determined 
the company believes that the dates as of which the uwc s were dated were earlier than the dates on which they were actually executed 
in a significant number of instances  the stock price on the assigned date the date as of which the uwc was executed was lower  sometimes substantially lower  than the price on the date the award may be deemed to have actually been determined 
we believe that this practice was done intentionally  by persons formerly in positions of responsibility at the company for the purpose of issuing options at a higher intrinsic value than would have otherwise been the case 
in connection with the findings of the special committee  we recorded a cumulative after tax adjustment of million  net of a million tax benefit through december  the cumulative after tax impact of the adjustments through december  was million and has been reflected in our ending accumulated deficit at december  the following table summarizes the impact of the non cash stock based compensation adjustments and related income tax effects on our previously reported net income loss in thousands as previously reported net income loss pre tax adjustments income tax benefit as restated net income loss year ended december     year ended december      year ended december     year ended december     year ended december     year ended december     year ended december     cumulative effect at december    year ended december     year ended december     total   in  we recorded million of professional fees as a direct result of the investigation into our stock option grant practices and related accounting 
these costs were recorded as a component of office and general expenses and primarily relate to professional services for legal  accounting and tax guidance 
in addition  we have incurred costs related to litigation  the informal investigation by the sec  the investigation by the united states attorney for the southern district of new york usao and the preparation and review of our restated consolidated financial statements 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million charge  as a component of salaries and related expenses to compensate optionees whose options expired during the period that our equity compensation programs were suspended 
we expect to continue to incur significant professional fees related to the ongoing stock option investigation 
while we cannot quantify or estimate the timing of these costs throughout and into the future  they primarily relate to legal fees paid on behalf of former employees and former members of senior management  fees paid in defense of shareholder litigation and potential fines or settlements 
certain stock options which were granted on a discounted basis exercise price is less than the fair market value of the stock on the date of grant are subject to internal revenue code section a a 
the provisions of a impose adverse consequences upon the individuals who receive such options including excise tax  additional interest charges and accelerated inclusion in income 
in january  the board of directors approved a tender offer plan to amend certain stock options granted to approximately individuals who received stock options that are subject to a in order to correct the options such that they are no longer subject to this provision 
the correction is made by increasing the exercise price to the same value used in connection with the financial statement restatement 
for individuals who agree to the modification  the company will compensate them for the increase in the exercise price by paying an amount equal to the difference in the exercise price for each option 
this amount is payable after january  assuming all individuals agree to the modification  the cash payment is expected to be approximately critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
in connection with the preparation of our financial statements  we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events  and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with gaap 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material
