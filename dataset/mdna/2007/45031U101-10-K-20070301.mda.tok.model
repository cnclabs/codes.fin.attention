risk factors 
introduction istar financial inc is a leading publicly traded finance company focused on the commercial real estate industry 
we primarily provide custom tailored financing to high end private and corporate owners of real estate  including senior and mezzanine real estate debt  senior and mezzanine corporate capital  corporate net lease financing and equity 
our company  which is taxed as a real estate investment trust reit  seeks to deliver strong dividends and superior risk adjusted returns on equity to shareholders by providing innovative and value added financing solutions to our customers 
our two primary lines of business are lending and corporate tenant leasing 
the lending business is primarily comprised of senior and mezzanine real estate loans that typically range in size from million to million and have maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
these loans may be either fixed rate based on the us treasury rate plus a spread or variable rate based on libor plus a spread and are structured to meet the specific financing needs of the borrowers 
we also provide senior and subordinated capital to corporations  particularly those engaged in real estate or real estate related businesses 
these financings may be either secured or unsecured  typically range in size from million to million and have maturities generally ranging from three to ten years 
as part of the lending business  we also acquire whole loans and loan participations which present attractive risk reward opportunities 
our corporate tenant leasing business provides capital to corporations and other owners who control facilities leased to single creditworthy customers 
our net leased assets are generally mission critical headquarters or distribution facilities that are subject to long term leases with public companies  many of which are rated corporate credits  and many of which provide for most expenses at the facility to be paid by the corporate customer on a triple net lease basis 
corporate tenant lease  or ctl  transactions have initial terms generally ranging from to years and typically range in size from million to million 
our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that our borrowers pay on our loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that our corporate customers pay us to lease our ctl properties 
a smaller and more variable source of revenue is other income  which consists primarily of prepayment penalties and realized gains that occur when our borrowers repay their loans before the maturity date 
we primarily generate income through the spread or margin  which is the difference between the revenues generated from our loans and leases and our interest expense and the cost of our ctl operations 
we generally seek to match fund our revenue generating assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that changes in interest rates or the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on our earnings 
executive overview the year ended december  marked significant growth in our asset base  our revenues and our organization 
we grew total assets by more than billion and generated million of net income and of diluted earnings per share eps during  compared to million of net income and of diluted eps during while we experienced increased competition and liquidity in the real estate finance markets  we continued to make progress in expanding our franchise across markets where we believe that we have competitive advantages 
during  in addition to the growth in our core business  we experienced growth in our autostar  timberstar and european operations 
autostar is a one stop provider of financing for the automobile dealership industry  which we believe is a natural extension of our core lending and corporate tenant lease businesses 
autostar surpassed the billion threshold for commitments in timberstar purchases timberlands and enters into long term lumber supply agreements with mills in close proximity to our land 
timberstar had a successful year as our team led and closed the billion acquisition of  acres of timberland from international paper in conjunction with several third party equity investors 
finally  we started our geographic expansion into europe where our strategy is to provide custom tailored financing solutions with the same high level of service for overseas borrowers that we provide in the us markets 
to support our growth  in we increased the total number of employees by across all levels of the organization and in multiple disciplines including investments  risk management  asset management  financing and accounting 
increased compensation costs and other employee related expenses are the primary reasons that our general and administrative costs increased in  as discussed in greater detail below 
we experienced some credit losses on our lending portfolio in  however  these losses continued to be minimal relative to our overall portfolio 
despite our strong track record  we expect that we will experience losses within the portfolio from time to time 
economic trends after experiencing difficult economic and market conditions in and  the commercial real estate industry experienced increasing property level operating returns through during this period  the industry attracted large amounts of investment capital which led to increased property valuations across most sectors 
investors such as pension funds and foreign buyers have increased their allocations to real estate and private real estate funds and individual investors have raised record amounts of capital to invest in the sector 
at the same time  interest rates have remained at historically low levels 
more recently  the yield curve  or the difference between short term and long term interest rates  has flattened or inverted 
lower interest rates have enabled many property owners to finance their assets at attractive rates and proceeds levels 
default rates on commercial mortgages have steadily declined over the past ten years and are now at or near historic lows 
as a result  many banks and insurance companies are increasing their real estate lending activities 
the securitization markets for commercial real estate  including both the commercial mortgage backed securities cmbs and the collateralized debt obligation cdo markets  have experienced record issuance volumes and liquidity 
investors in this arena have been willing to buy increasingly complex and aggressively underwritten transactions 
while the fundamentals in most real estate markets are firming  valuations have increased at a faster pace than underlying cash flows due to the large supply of investor capital 
the commercial real estate industry has undergone a transformation over the past ten years 
during this time many large real estate owning companies went public and thousands of commercial real estate loans were rated and securitized 
this resulted in the public disclosure of significantly more property level and market data than had been available in the past 
in addition  numerous on line real estate data sources have been successful in filling the information void and have created publicly available data on almost all real estate asset types across the country 
access to this data has dramatically increased the visibility in the industry 
better disclosure and data has enabled broader and more informed investor participation in the sector and should be an important component in moderating the impact of the broader economic cycles on the real estate industry over longer periods of time 
key performance measures the following discussion of our results describes the impact that the key trends have had  and are expected to continue to have for the foreseeable future  on our business 
profitability indicators we use the following metrics to measure our profitability adjusted diluted eps  calculated as adjusted diluted earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 
see section captioned adjusted earnings for more information on this metric 
net finance margin  calculated as the rate of return on assets less the cost of debt 
the rate of return on assets is the sum of interest income and operating lease income  divided by the sum of the average book value of gross corporate tenant lease assets  loans and other lending investments  purchased intangibles and assets held for sale over the period 
the cost of debt is the sum of interest expense and operating costs for corporate tenant lease assets  divided by the average book value of gross debt obligations during the period 
adjusted return on average common book equity  calculated as adjusted basic earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders divided by average common book equity 
the following table summarizes these key metrics for the years ended december  adjusted diluted eps net finance margin adjusted return on average common book equity explanatory note for the years ended december   and  operating lease income used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of   and  for the years ended december   and  interest expense used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of  and for the years ended december   and  operating costs corporate tenant lease assets used to calculate the net finance margin includes amounts from discontinued operations of   and  net finance margin for includes non cash impairment charges of million 
excluding these charges  the net finance margin would have been 
the following is an overview of how we performed in respect to each key performance measure and how those items affected profitability and were impacted by key trends 
asset growth reflects our ability to originate new loans and leases and grow our asset base in a prudent manner 
during the year ended december   we had billion of transaction volume representing financing commitments 
repeat customer business has become a key source of transaction volume  accounting for approximately of our cumulative volume from inception through december  transaction volume for the years ended december  and were billion and billion  respectively 
we completed and financing commitments in and  respectively 
we have also experienced significant growth during the last several years through a number of strategic acquisitions which complemented our organic growth and extended our business franchise 
based upon feedback from our customers  we believe that greater name recognition  our reputation for completing highly structured transactions in an efficient manner  the service level we provide to our customers and our reduced cost of capital have contributed to increases in transaction volume 
the benefits of higher investment volumes have been mitigated to an extent by the low interest rate environment that has persisted in recent years 
low interest rates benefit us in that our borrowing costs decrease  but similarly  earnings on our variable rate lending investments also decrease 
the increased investment and lending activity in both the public and private commercial real estate markets  as described under key trends  has resulted in a highly competitive real estate financing environment with reduced returns on assets 
the reduction in our return on assets has been partially offset by our lower cost of funds 
over the past several years  while property level fundamentals have stabilized and are generally beginning to improve  investment activity in direct real estate ownership has increased dramatically 
in many cases  this has caused property valuations to increase disproportionately to any corresponding increase in fundamentals 
corporate tenant leases  or net leased properties  are one of the most stable real estate asset classes and have garnered significant interest from both institutional and retail investors who seek long term  stable income streams 
in many cases  we believe that the valuations of ctl assets in today s market do not represent solid risk adjusted returns 
as a result  we have not invested as heavily in this asset class  acquiring only million in and million in  compared to million in while we continue to monitor the ctl market and review certain transactions  we have shifted most of our origination resources to our lending business until we see compelling opportunities for ctl acquisitions in the market again 
despite the competitive environment  we intend to maintain our disciplined approach to underwriting our investments and will adjust our focus away from markets and products where we believe that the available pricing terms do not fairly reflect the risks of the investments 
we will also continue to maintain our disciplined investment strategy and deploy capital to those opportunities that demonstrate the most attractive returns 
risk management reflects our ability to underwrite and manage our loans and leases to balance income production potential with the potential for credit losses 
we continued to manage our business to ensure that the overall credit quality of the portfolio remained strong 
there were no major changes to the portfolio credit statistics in versus the remaining weighted average duration of the loan portfolio is years 
we have historically experienced minimal credit losses on our lending investments 
during  we charged off million against the reserve for loan losses 
during and  we recognized no credit losses 
at december   our non performing loan assets represented of total assets versus at year end we believe that we have established adequate loan loss reserves 
at december   the weighted average risk rating on the ctl portfolio was essentially unchanged from year end we continue to focus on re leasing space at our ctl facilities under longer term leases in an effort to reduce the impact of lease expirations on our earnings 
as of december   the weighted average lease term on our ctl portfolio was years and the portfolio was leased 
we expect the average lease term of our portfolio to decline somewhat until such time that we begin to find new acquisition opportunities that meet our investment criteria 
cost and availability of funds reflects our ability to access funding sources at competitive rates and terms and insulate our margin from changes in interest rates 
in  we began migrating our debt obligations from secured debt to unsecured debt 
we believed that funding ourselves on an unsecured basis would enable us to better serve our customers  more effectively match fund our assets and provide us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
early in  we made significant progress to that end by completing a new unsecured bank facility that initially had million of capacity and was subsequently increased to billion of capacity in december we also took advantage of the very low interest rate environment and issued longer term unsecured debt  using the proceeds to repay existing secured credit facilities and mortgage debt 
we continued to emphasize our use of unsecured debt to fund new net asset growth and to repay existing secured debt in in october of  in part as a result of our shift to unsecured debt  our senior unsecured debt ratings were upgraded to investment grade bbb baa by s p and moody s 
this resulted in a broader market for our bonds and a lower cost of debt 
in  we continued to broaden our sources of capital  particularly in the unsecured bank and bond markets 
we completed billion in bond offerings  upsized our unsecured credit facility to billion and eliminated three secured lines of credit 
we also repaid our million of stars asset backed notes  which resulted in the recognition of a million early extinguishment charge 
we lowered our percentage of secured debt to total debt to at the end of from at the end of as a result  we have completed our goals of substantially unencumbering our asset base  decreasing secured debt and increasing our unsecured credit capacity to replace our secured facilities 
in the first quarter of  s p  moody s and fitch upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb  baa  and bbb from bbb  baa and bbb  respectively 
during  we completed billion of bond offerings and completed an exchange offer on our highest rate corporate bonds 
in addition  we upsized our unsecured credit facility to billion and amended the facility to allow us to borrow british pounds  euros and canadian dollars to better enable us to invest outside the united states 
this capability will enable us to more effectively match fund our foreign investments 
during  our percentage of secured debt to total debt remained at 
we seek to match fund our assets with either fixed or floating rate debt of a similar maturity so that rising interest rates or changes in the shape of the yield curve will have a minimal impact on our earnings 
our policy requires that we manage our fixed floating rate exposure such that a basis point move in short term interest rates would have no more than a impact on our quarterly adjusted earnings 
at december   a basis point increase in libor would result in a increase in our fourth quarter adjusted earnings 
we have used fixed rate or floating rate hedges to manage our fixed and floating rate exposure  however  because we now have investment grade credit ratings  we are able to better access the floating rate debt markets and in the future we expect to decrease the need for derivatives to match fund our debt 
we also seek to match fund our foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated debt so that changes in foreign exchange rates or forward curves will have a minimal impact on earnings 
foreign denominated assets and liabilities are presented in our financial statements in us dollars at current exchange rates each reporting period with changes flowing through earnings 
matched assets and liabilities in the same currency are a natural hedge against currency fluctuations 
for investments denominated in currencies other than british pounds  canadian dollars and euros  we primarily use forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
while we consider it prudent to have a broad array of sources of capital  including some secured financing arrangements  we expect to continue to emphasize our use of unsecured debt in funding our net asset growth going forward 
we believe that we have ample short term capital available to provide liquidity and to fund our business 
expense management reflects our ability to maintain a customer oriented and cost effective operation 
we measure the efficiency of our operations by tracking our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of general and administrative expenses to total revenue 
our efficiency ratio was and for and  respectively 
the increase in reflects increases in payroll costs  expenses associated with employee growth including additional office space costs  expenses associated with the ramp up of several new business initiatives including our autostar  timberstar and european ventures 
management talent is one of our most significant assets and our payroll costs are correspondingly our largest non interest cash expense 
the market for management talent is highly competitive and we do not expect to materially decrease this expense in the coming years 
however  we believe that our efficiency ratio remains low by industry standards and expect it to normalize somewhat as acquisitions and new businesses stabilize 
capital management reflects our ability to maintain a strong capital base through the use of prudent financial leverage 
we use a dynamic capital allocation model to derive our maximum targeted corporate leverage 
we calculate our leverage as the ratio of book debt to the sum of book equity  accumulated depreciation  accumulated depletion and loan loss reserves 
our leverage was x  x and x in  and  respectively 
in  when we went public  our leverage levels were very low  around x 
since that time we have been slowly increasing our leverage to our targeted levels 
we evaluate our capital model target leverage levels based upon leverage levels achieved for similar assets in other markets  market liquidity levels for underlying assets and default and severity experience 
our data currently suggest that capital levels in our capital allocation model are conservative 
we measure our capital management by the strength of our tangible capital base and the ratio of our tangible book equity to total book assets 
our tangible book equity was billion  billion and billion as of december   and  respectively 
our ratio of tangible book equity to total book assets was  and as of december   and  respectively 
the decline in this ratio is attributable to a modest increase in financial leverage as we have moved towards our target capital level 
we believe that relative to other finance companies  we are very well capitalized for a company of our size and asset base 
results of operations revenue for the years ended december  v

change change interest income operating lease income other income total revenue the increase in revenue during was primarily due to increased interest income 
higher interest income during resulted primarily from a billion increase in the average outstanding balance of loans and other lending investments 
interest income was also higher due to a higher average rate of return on our loans and lending investments  which increased to in  from in the increased rate of return was primarily attributable to our variable rate lending investments which reset at higher rates during when the average one month libor rate was compared to in during  our operating lease income grew by million reflecting new ctl investments and a favorable lease restructuring  partially offset by a lease termination and some additional vacancy on certain ctl assets 
other income was million lower in than in this decline resulted from a decrease in prepayment penalties and gains on marketable securities  partially offset by increases in lease termination fees  income from timber operations  and income from other investments 
the increase in revenue during was due to increases in all three revenue line items 
higher interest income during resulted primarily from a million increase in the average outstanding balance of loans and other lending investments 
interest income was also higher due to a higher average rate of return on our loans and lending investments  which increased to in  from in the increased rate of return was primarily attributable to the our variable rate lending investments which reset at higher rates due to higher average one month libor rates of in  compared to in during  our operating lease income grew by million  primarily due to new ctl investments 
the increase was partially offset by lower operating lease income due to vacancies and lower rental rates on certain ctl assets

change change interest expense during  our average outstanding debt balance was billion higher than during  resulting in the majority of the increase in interest expense 
interest expense was also higher due to slightly higher average rates  which increased from in to in during  the increase in interest expense was due to both an increase in our average outstanding debt balance and higher rates 
the average outstanding debt balance during was million higher than during and average rates increased from in to in higher average one month and three month libor rates during and increased our interest expense on any unhedged portions of our variable rate debt

change change operating costs corporate tenant lease assets depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses loss on early extinguishment of debt total other costs and expenses from to  total other costs and expenses were relatively flat  however  there were some significant changes in the line item components 
during  general and administrative expenses increased by million  primarily due to an increase in employee growth and ramp up of new business initiatives 
during the year ended december  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million in connection with the company s high performance unit equity compensation program for senior management 
the non cash compensation charge is the result of a correction due to a change in assumptions for the liquidity  non voting and forfeiture discounts used in valuing the hpu securities issued in the seven plans offered since the commencement of the program in see note stock based compensation plans and employee benefits on the company s consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the cumulative charge was recorded during  rather than restating prior periods  because we concluded that the expense was not material to any of our previously issued financial statements for any period 
during  additional provisions for loan losses of million increased the reserve for the loan losses and charge offs reduced the reserve by million 
this net increase in the reserve was based on our risk rating process and the increase in the size of our loan portfolio 
from to  total other costs and expenses decreased by million  primarily due to a decrease in general and administrative expenses offset by an increase in the losses from early extinguishment of debt 
during  we recognized stock based compensation charges of approximately million primarily related to the vesting of grants received by our chief executive officer and others 
during  we incurred losses related to the early repayment of our stars  series notes and series notes and a million term loan 
during  we incurred losses related to the early repayment of a portion of our senior notes due  several term loans and an unsecured credit facility 
other components of net income equity in earnings of joint ventures equity in earnings of joint ventures was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in earnings of joint ventures during was primarily due to increases in performance fees from our investments in oak hill 
discontinued operations we sold  and ctl assets to six different buyers and realized gains of approximately million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
adjusted earnings we measure our performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income 
adjusted earnings represent net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  depletion  amortization  gain from discontinued operations  extraordinary items and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
adjustments for joint ventures reflect our share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
we believe that adjusted earnings is a helpful measure to consider  in addition to net income  because this measure helps us to evaluate how our commercial real estate finance business is performing compared to other commercial finance companies  without the effects of certain gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of current operating performance 
the most significant gaap adjustments that we exclude in determining adjusted earnings are depreciation  depletion and amortization  which are typically non cash charges 
as a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing  we record significant depreciation on our real estate assets and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our borrowings 
we also record depletion on our timber assets 
depreciation  depletion and amortization do not affect our daily operations  but they do impact financial results under gaap 
by measuring our performance using adjusted earnings and net income  we are able to evaluate how our business is performing both before and after giving effect to recurring gaap adjustments such as depreciation  depletion and amortization including earnings from joint venture interests on the same basis and excluding gains or losses from the sale of assets that will no longer be part of continuing operations 
adjusted earnings is not an alternative or substitute for net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
rather  we believe that adjusted earnings is an additional measure that helps us analyze how our business is performing 
this measure is also used to track compliance with covenants in certain of our material borrowing arrangements that have covenants based upon this measure 
adjusted earnings should not be viewed as an alternative measure of either our liquidity or funds available for our cash needs or for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  we may not calculate adjusted earnings in the same manner as other companies that use a similarly titled measure 
for the years ended december  in thousands unaudited adjusted earnings net income allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders add joint venture income add depreciation  depletion and amortization add joint venture depreciation  depletion and amortization add amortization of deferred financing costs less gains from discontinued operations adjusted diluted earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders weighted average diluted common shares outstanding explanatory notes hpu holders are company employees who purchased high performance common stock units under the company s high performance unit program

for the years ended december     and  adjusted diluted earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders includes approximately  million  million  and million  respectively  of cash paid for prepayment penalties associated with early extinguishment of debt 
for the year ended december   adjusted diluted earnings allocable to common shareholders and hpu holders includes a million charge related to performance based vesting of  restricted shares granted under the company s long term incentive plan to the chief financial officer  the vesting of million phantom shares on march  granted to the chief executive officer  the one time award of common stock with a value of million to the chief executive officer  the vesting of  restricted shares granted to several employees and the company s share of taxes associated with all transactions

in addition to the gaap defined weighted average diluted shares outstanding these balances include an additional  shares   shares   shares and  shares for the years ended december    and  respectively  relating to the additional dilution of joint venture shares 
there were no additional shares included for the year ended december   relating to the dilution of joint venture shares 
risk management loan credit statistics the table below summarizes our non performing loans and details the reserve for loan losses and charge offs associated with our loans for the years ended december  and in thousands as of december  carrying value of non performing loans as a percentage of total assets as a percentage of total loans reserve for loan losses as a percentage of total assets as a percentage of total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total assets as a percentage of total loans non performing loans all non performing loans are placed on non accrual status where income is recognized only upon actual cash receipt 
we designate loans as non performing at such time as management determines the borrower is incapable of  or has ceased efforts towards  curing the cause of an impairment  the loan becomes days delinquent  the loan has a maturity default  or the net realizable value of the loan s underlying collateral approximates our carrying value of such loan 
as of december   we had two non performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of million  or of total assets  compared to at december  management believes there is adequate collateral to support the book values of the loans 
watch list assets we conduct a quarterly comprehensive credit review  resulting in an individual risk rating being assigned to each asset 
this review is designed to enable management to evaluate and proactively manage asset specific credit issues and identify credit trends on a portfolio wide basis as an early warning system 
as of december   we had five assets on the credit watch list  excluding those assets included in non performing loans above  with an aggregate carrying value of million  or of total assets 
net charge offs during  we recorded total charge offs of million  primarily related to two separate loan transactions 
of the total  million was from a direct charge off on a mezzanine loan on a class a office building in the midwest 
several tenants who occupied approximately  square feet vacated the building when their leases expired in december which reduced occupancy from to 
as of december   we also hold all three tranches of a first mortgage loan for which this same building serves as sole collateral 
the first mortgage has a cumulative carrying value of million 
we have assessed the remaining positions as of december  and do not believe they are impaired 
in addition  million was from a direct charge off on a first mortgage on an auto dealership in the southeast 
the dealership was experiencing continued deterioration in its financial performance resulting in insufficient fixed charge coverage on the loan 
after taking the impairment charges  management believes there is adequate collateral to support the carrying value of both loans as of december  liquidity and capital resources we require significant capital to fund our investment activities and operating expenses 
while the distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital committed to our operations  we believe we have sufficient access to capital resources to fund our existing business plan  which includes the expansion of our real estate lending and corporate tenant leasing businesses 
our capital sources include cash flow from operations  borrowings under lines of credit  additional term borrowings  unsecured corporate debt financing  financings secured by our assets  trust preferred debt  and the issuance of common  convertible and or preferred equity securities 
further  we may acquire other businesses or assets using our capital stock  cash or a combination thereof 
we believe that our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short and long term liquidity needs 
our ability to meet our long term ie  beyond one year liquidity requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
any decision by our lenders and investors to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors  such as our compliance with the terms of existing credit arrangements  our financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
the following table outlines the contractual obligations related to our long term debt agreements and operating lease obligations as of december  we have no other long term liabilities that would constitute a contractual obligation

all variable rate debt assumes a day libor rate of the day libor rate at december  
we also have a million letter of credit outstanding as security for our primary corporate office lease 
we also have letters of credit outstanding totaling million as additional collateral for five of our investments 
see off balance sheet transactions below  for a discussion of certain unfunded commitments related to our lending and ctl business 
our primary credit facility is an unsecured credit facility totaling billion which bears interest at libor per annum  has an annual facility fee of basis points and matures in june at december   we had million drawn under this facility see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
we also have one libor based secured revolving credit facility with an aggregate maximum capacity of million  of which there was no amount drawn as of december  availability under the secured credit facility is based on collateral provided under a borrowing base calculation 
our debt obligations contain covenants that are both financial and non financial in nature 
significant financial covenants include limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness beyond specified levels and a requirement to maintain specified ratios of unsecured indebtedness compared to unencumbered assets 
as a result of the upgrades of our senior unsecured debt ratings by s p  moody s and fitch  in january and february  the financial covenants in some series of our publicly held debt securities are not operative see rating triggers below 
significant non financial covenants include a requirement in some series of our publicly held debt securities that we offer to repurchase those securities at a premium if we undergo a change of control 
as of december   we believe we are in compliance with all financial and non financial covenants on our debt obligations 
unencumbered assets unsecured debt we have completed the migration of our balance sheet towards unsecured debt  which generally results in a corresponding reduction of secured debt and an increase in unencumbered assets 
the exact timing in which we will issue or borrow unsecured debt will be subject to market conditions 
the following table shows the ratio of unencumbered assets to unsecured debt at december  and in thousands as of december  total unencumbered assets total unsecured debt unencumbered assets unsecured debt explanatory note see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of our unsecured debt 
capital markets activity during the year ended december   we issued billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at annual rates ranging from to and maturing between and and million of variable rate senior notes bearing interest at three month libor maturing in in connection with the issuance of these notes  we settled four forward starting swaps that were entered into in may and june of we primarily used the proceeds from the issuance of these securities to repay outstanding indebtedness under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
in addition  our million of senior notes matured in may in addition  on october   we exchanged our senior notes due for senior notes due in accordance with the exchange offer and consent solicitation issued on october  for each  principal amount of senior notes tendered  holders received approximately  principal amount of senior notes and of cash 
a total of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes were issued as part of the exchange 
we also amended certain covenants in the indenture relating to the remaining senior notes due as a result of a consent solicitation of the holders of these notes 
in addition  in november  we completed an underwritten public offering of million primary shares of our common stock 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offering and used these proceeds to repay outstanding balances under our revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   we issued billion aggregate principal amount of fixed rate senior notes bearing interest at annual rates ranging from to and maturing between and  and million of variable rate senior notes bearing interest at annual rates ranging from three month libor to and maturing between and the proceeds from these transactions were used to repay outstanding balances on our revolving credit facilities 
in addition  on september   we completed the issuance of million in unsecured floating rate trust preferred securities through a newly formed statutory trust  istar financial statutory trust i  which is our wholly owned subsidiary 
the securities are subordinate to our senior unsecured debt and bear interest at a rate of libor 
the trust preferred securities are redeemable  at our option  in whole or in part  with no prepayment premium any time after october in addition  on march   we exchanged our trinet senior notes due for istar series b senior notes due in accordance with the exchange offer and consent solicitation issued on january  for each  principal amount of trinet notes tendered  holders received approximately  principal amount of istar notes 
a total of million aggregate principal amount of istar notes were issued 
the istar notes issued in the exchange offer form part of the series of istar series b notes due issued on march  also  on march   we amended certain covenants in the indenture relating to the notes due as a result of a consent solicitation of the holders of those notes 
following the successful completion of the consent solicitation  we merged trinet into istar  we became the obligor on the notes and trinet no longer existed see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
unsecured secured credit facilities activity on june   the unsecured facility was amended and restated 
the commitment increased to billion  of which up to million can be borrowed in multiple foreign currencies 
the maturity date was extended to june  the rate on the facility decreased to libor and the annual facility fee decreased to basis points 
the original facility completed on april  had a maximum capacity of million  was increased to billion on december  and was further increased to billion on september  the original rate on the facility was libor per annum with a basis point annual facility fee 
in  this was decreased to libor with a basis point annual facility fee due to an upgrade in our senior unsecured debt rating 
the rate was further decreased to libor with a basis point annual facility fee as a result of further upgrades to our unsecured debt ratings in on january   we extended the maturity on our remaining secured facility to january including the one year term out extension  reduced our capacity from million to million and lowered our interest rates to libor to from libor to on march   august   and september   respectively  three of our secured revolving credit facilities  with a maximum amount available to draw of million  million and million  matured 
other financing activity during the year ended december   the portion of the million term financing that was secured by certain commercial mortgage backed securities was extended for one month and then matured on february  the remaining portion of this financing that was secured by corporate bonds was extended for one year to august and the rate on the loan was reduced to libor to from libor to 
the carrying value of corporate bonds securing the borrowing totaled million at december  in addition  on may   we began a loan participation program which serves as an alternative to borrowing funds from our revolving credit facilities 
the loan participations are short term bank loans funded in the secondary market with fixed maturity dates typically ranging from overnight to days 
there was no outstanding balance under this program at december  during the year ended december   we repaid a million mortgage on ctl investments which was open to prepayment without penalty 
we also prepaid a million mortgage on a ctl asset with a prepayment penalty 
in addition  we fully repaid all of our outstanding stars series and stars series notes which had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately million on the date of repayment 
the stars notes were originally issued in and by special purpose subsidiaries for the purpose of match funding our assets that collateralized the stars notes 
for accounting purposes  the issuance of the stars notes was treated as a secured on balance sheet financing and no gain on sale was recognized in connection with the redemption of the stars notes  we incurred one time cash costs  including prepayment and other fees  of approximately million and a non cash charge of approximately million to write off deferred financing fees and expenses 
hedging activities we have variable rate lending assets and variable rate debt obligations 
these assets and liabilities create a natural hedge against changes in variable interest rates 
this means that as interest rates increase  we earn more on our variable rate lending assets and pay more on our variable rate debt obligations and  conversely  as interest rates decrease  we earn less on our variable rate lending assets and pay less on our variable rate debt obligations 
when the amount of our variable rate debt obligations exceeds the amount of our variable rate lending assets  we use derivative instruments to limit the impact of changing interest rates on our net income 
we have a policy in place  that is administered by the audit committee  which requires us to enter into hedging transactions to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on our earnings 
the policy states that a basis point increase in short term rates cannot have a greater than impact on quarterly earnings 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the derivative instruments we use are typically in the form of interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
interest rate swaps effectively can either convert variable rate debt obligations to fixed rate debt obligations or convert fixed rate debt obligations into variable rate debt obligations 
interest rate caps effectively limit the maximum interest rate payable on variable rate debt obligations 
in addition  we also use derivative instruments to manage our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
the primary risks related to our use of derivative instruments are the risks that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement could default on its obligation and the risk that we may have to pay certain costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if we terminate a hedging arrangement 
as a matter of policy  we enter into hedging arrangements with counterparties that are large  creditworthy financial institutions typically rated at least a a by s p and moody s  respectively 
our hedging strategy is approved and monitored by our audit committee on behalf of the board of directors and may be changed by the board of directors without shareholder approval

during  we recorded million of hedge ineffectiveness in other income on the company s consolidated statements of operations  primarily related to the timing of an anticipated hedged transaction 
during  hedge ineffectiveness was immaterial 
off balance sheet transactions we are not dependent on the use of any off balance sheet financing arrangements for liquidity 
as of december   we did not have any ctl joint ventures accounted for under the equity method  which had third party debt 
as part of the acquisition of falcon financial  we obtained falcon financial s residual interests and servicing obligations related to four off balance sheet loan securitizations 
our ongoing relationship with these special purpose entities is not material to our operations 
our stars notes were all on balance sheet financings 
these securitizations were prepaid on september  we have certain discretionary and non discretionary unfunded commitments related to our loans and other lending investments that we may be required to  or choose to  fund in the future 
discretionary commitments are those under which we have sole discretion with respect to future funding 
non discretionary commitments are those that we are generally obligated to fund at the request of the borrower or upon the occurrence of events outside of our direct control 
as of december   we had loans with unfunded commitments totaling billion  of which million was discretionary and billion was non discretionary 
in addition  we have million of discretionary unfunded commitments and million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to ten ctl investments 
these commitments generally fall into two categories pre approved capital improvement projects  and new or additional construction costs 
upon completion of the improvements or construction  we would receive additional operating lease income from the customers 
in addition  we have million of non discretionary unfunded commitments related to existing customers in the form of tenant improvements which were negotiated between the company and the customers at the commencement of the leases 
further  we had equity investments with unfunded non discretionary commitments of million 
ratings triggers the billion unsecured revolving credit facility that we had in place at december   bears interest at libor per annum based on our senior unsecured credit ratings of bbb from s p  baa from moody s and bbb from fitch ratings 
originally  this rate was reduced from libor to libor due to the investment grade upgrade of our senior unsecured debt rating by s p in october it was further reduced from libor to libor after our senior unsecured debt rating was further upgraded by s p  moody s and fitch in the first quarter of see below 
on february   s p upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb and raised the ratings on our preferred stock to bb from bb 
on february   moody s upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to baa from baa and raised the ratings on our preferred stock to ba from ba on january   fitch ratings upgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to bbb from bbb and raised our preferred stock rating to bb from bb  with a stable outlook 
the upgrades were primarily a result of our further migration to an unsecured capital structure  including the repayment of the stars notes 
as a result of the upgrades in of our senior unsecured debt ratings by s p  moody s and fitch  the financial covenants in some series of our publicly held debt securities  including limitations on incurrence of indebtedness and maintenance of unencumbered assets compared to unsecured indebtedness  are not operative 
if we were to be downgraded from our current ratings by two of these three rating agencies  these financial covenants would become operative again 
on october   moody s upgraded our senior unsecured debt ratings to baa from ba the upgraded rating reflected the shift towards unsecured debt and the resulting increase in unencumbered assets  the continued profitable growth in our business franchise  the strong quality of both the structured finance and ctl business and the active management of those businesses 
on october   our senior unsecured credit rating was upgraded to an investment grade rating of bbb from bb by s p as a result of our positive track record of improving performance through a slightly difficult real estate cycle  our strong underwriting and servicing capabilities  the increase in capital base  the shift towards unsecured debt to free up assets and the staggering of maturities on secured debt 
except as described above  there are no other ratings triggers in any of our debt instruments or other operating or financial agreements at december  transactions with related parties during  we invested in a substantial minority interest of oak hill advisors  lp  oak hill credit alpha mgp  ohsf gp partners ii  llc  oak hill credit opportunities mgp  llc  and in  ohsf gp partners  llc see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detail 
in relation to our investment in these entities  we appointed to our board of directors a member that holds a substantial investment in these same five entities 
as of december   the carrying value in these ventures was million 
during  we had an investment in istar operating inc istar operating  a taxable subsidiary that  through a wholly owned subsidiary  services our loans and certain loan portfolios owned by third parties 
we owned all of the non voting preferred stock and a economic interest in istar operating 
an entity controlled by a former director of istar  owned all of the voting common stock and a economic interest in istar operating 
on december   we acquired all the voting common stock and the remaining economic interest in istar operating for a nominal amount and simultaneously merged it into an existing taxable reit subsidiary of ours 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  during  certain affiliates of starwood opportunity fund iv  lp and our chief executive officer have reimbursed us for the value of restricted shares awarded to our former president in excess of  shares 
drip stock purchase plans we maintain a dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan 
under the dividend reinvestment component of the plan  our shareholders may purchase additional shares of common stock without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges by automatically reinvesting all or a portion of their common stock cash dividends 
under the direct stock purchase component of the plan  our shareholders and new investors may purchase shares of common stock directly from us without payment of brokerage commissions or service charges 
all purchases of shares in excess of  per month pursuant to the direct purchase component are at our sole discretion 
shares issued under the plan may reflect a discount of up to from the prevailing market price of our common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to million shares of common stock pursuant to the dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plans 
during the years ended december  and  we issued a total of approximately  and  shares of common stock  respectively  through the plans 
net proceeds for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
there are approximately million shares available for issuance under the plan as of december  stock repurchase program in november  the board of directors approved  and we implemented  a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to million shares of common stock from time to time  primarily using proceeds from the disposition of assets or loan repayments and excess cash flow from operations  but also using borrowings under our credit facilities if we determine that it is advantageous to do so 
there is no fixed expiration date to this plan 
as of december   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
we have not repurchased any shares under the stock repurchase program since november  however  we issued approximately million shares of treasury stock during see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods  including any judgments made as part of such methods  are well controlled  reviewed and applied consistently from period to period 
we base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and  therefore  routinely require adjustment 
during  management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of accounting policies that require more significant management estimates and judgments allowance for loan losses our allowance for estimated loan losses represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
while we have experienced minimal actual losses on our loans  we believe that it is prudent to reflect an allowance for loan losses based upon our assessment of general market conditions  our internal risk management policies and credit risk rating system  historical industry loss experience  our assessment of the likelihood of delinquencies or defaults and the value of the collateral underlying our loans 
determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the allowance for loan losses was million and million on december  and  respectively 
we assess our non performing loans and watch list assets for individual impairment each reporting period 
impairment is indicated when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
our loans are primarily evaluated based on the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
we determine the fair value of the collateral using one or more valuation techniques  such as property appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analyses or replacement cost comparisons 
determination of the fair value of collateral  by any of these techniques  requires significant judgment and discretion by management 
if we determine that a loan is impaired  either a specific reserve is created or the loan  or a portion thereof  is charged off through the allowance for loan losses 
during  our loan impairment testing resulted in charge offs of million through the allowance for loan losses 
there were no loan impairments recognized during or long lived assets impairment test we test our long lived assets for impairment  which are primarily our ctl assets to be held and used  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists when the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
for this test  recoverability is determined by the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
the determination of projected cash flows and eventual sales prices of our long lived assets requires significant judgment by management about matters that are inherently uncertain 
goodwill impairment test goodwill is not amortized  instead it is tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
there are two parts to the goodwill impairment analysis 
the first part of the test is a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit containing goodwill to its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
the second test requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be allocated to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the fair value of assets less liabilities is the implied value of goodwill and is used to determine the amount of impairment 
there were no impairment charges recognized during  or related to goodwill 
fair value of derivatives we have historically used derivatives to help manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks 
derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value as assets or liabilities 
fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing unrelated parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the degree of management judgment involved in determining the fair value of a financial instrument depends on the availability and reliability of relevant market data  such as quoted market prices 
financial instruments that are actively traded and have quoted market prices or readily available market data require minimal judgment in determining fair value 
when observable market prices and data are not readily available or do not exist  we estimate the fair value using market data and model based interpolations using standard models that are widely accepted within the industry 
market data includes prices of instruments with similar maturities and characteristics  duration  interest rate yield curves and measures of volatility 
derivative assets were million and derivatives liabilities were million on december   compared with derivative assets of million and derivatives liabilities of million on december  consolidation variable interest entities we are a party to a number of off balance sheet joint ventures and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures 
we consolidate certain entities in which we own less than a equity interest if we determine that we have a controlling interest or are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity vie as defined in fasb interpretation no 
revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin r 
there is a significant amount of judgment required in interpreting the provisions of fin r and applying them to specific transactions 
in order to determine if an entity is considered a vie  we first perform a qualitative analysis  which requires certain subjective decisions regarding our assessment  including  but not limited to  the nature and structure of the entity  the variability of the economic interests that the entity passes along to its interest holders  the rights of the parties and the purpose of the arrangement 
an iterative quantitative analysis is required if our qualitative analysis proves inconclusive as to whether the entity is a vie or we are the primary beneficiary and consolidation is required 
new accounting standards in december  the fasb released fsp eitf eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements 
eitf specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment agreement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement  accounting for contingencies 
an entity may issue financial instruments that are subject to a registration payment arrangement 
under such arrangement  the issuer agrees to endeavor i to file a registration statement for the resale of specified financial instruments and or for the resale of equity shares that are issuable upon exercise or conversion of those financial instruments and  ii for the registration statement to be declared effective by the sec within a specified grace period 
in some registration payment arrangements  the issuer may be required to endeavor to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a specified period of time 
the company will adopt eitf on january   as required and is still evaluating the impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec released sab sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
through sab  the sec has established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of the error on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is known as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement but can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior years on the income statement in the period of correction 
companies can either restate prior periods or use the cumulative effect adjustment method when adopting sab sab is not an official rule and therefore there is no explicit effective date  however  for companies not electing to restate prior periods  it must be adopted for annual financial statements covering fiscal years ending after november  we adopted sab for the fiscal year ended december   as required  and it did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the exchange price notion in the fair value definition to mean the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability an exit price  not the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price 
this statement also clarifies that market participant assumptions should include assumptions about risk  should include assumptions about the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and should reflect its nonperformance risk the risk that the obligation will not be fulfilled 
nonperformance risk should include the reporting entity s credit risk

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits 
the tax benefit is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin on january   as required  and do not believe it will have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 accounting for servicing of financial assets 
sfas no 
was issued to simplify the accounting for servicing rights and to reduce the volatility that results from the use of different measurement attributes for servicing rights and the related financial instruments used to economically hedge risks associated with those servicing rights 
sfas no 
modifies the accounting for servicing rights by clarifying when a separate asset or servicing liability should be recognized  requiring a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability to be measured at fair value  allowing entities to subsequently measure servicing rights either at fair value or under the amortization method for each class of a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability  permitting a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities  and requiring separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value 
sfas no

 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
the key provisions of sfas no 
include a broad fair value measurement option for certain hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation  clarification that only the simplest separations of interest payments and principal payments qualify for the exception afforded to interest only strips ios and principal only strips pos from derivative accounting under paragraph of sfas no 
thereby narrowing such exception  a requirement that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or whether they are hybrid instruments that contain embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation  clarification that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives  and elimination of the prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity qspe holding passive derivative financial instruments that pertain to beneficial interests that are or contain a derivative financial instrument

in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights 
eitf states that a sole general partner is presumed to control a limited partnership or similar entity and should consolidate the limited partnership unless one of the following two conditions exist the limited partners possess substantive kick out rights  or the limited partners possess substantive participating rights 
a kick out right is defined as the substantive ability to remove the sole general partner without cause or otherwise dissolve liquidate the limited partnership 
substantive participating rights are when the limited partners have the substantive right to participate in certain financial and operating decisions of the limited partnership that are made in the ordinary course of business 
the consensus guidance in eitf is effective for all agreements entered into or modified after june  for all pre existing agreements that are not modified  the consensus is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal reporting period beginning after december  we adopted the provisions of this statement as required and it did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to newly adopted accounting principles 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retrospectively  unless deemed immaterial

fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies that the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  as a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity 
the obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional even though uncertainty exists about the timing and or method of settlement 
thus  the timing and or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event 
accordingly  an entity is required to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the fair value of a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation should be recognized when incurred generally upon acquisition  construction  or development and or through the normal operation of the asset 
uncertainty about the timing and or method of settlement of a conditional asset retirement obligation should be factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists 
sfas no 
acknowledges that in some cases  sufficient information may not be available to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
fin also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation 
we adopted fin during and it did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

 accounting for non monetary transactions 
sfas no 
requires non monetary exchanges to be accounted for at fair value  recognizing any gain or loss  if the transactions meet a commercial substance criterion and fair value is determinable 
sfas no

in december  the fasb released statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this standard requires issuers to measure the cost of equity based service awards based on the grant date fair value of the award 
that cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award or the requisite service period typically the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
the company will initially measure the cost of liability based service awards based on their current fair value 
the fair value of that award will be remeasured subsequently at each reporting date through the settlement date 
changes in fair value during the requisite service period will be recognized as compensation cost over that period 
the grant date fair value of employee share options and similar instruments will be estimated using option pricing models adjusted for the unique characteristics of those instruments 
if an equity award is modified after the grant date  incremental compensation cost will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award immediately before the modification 
companies can comply with sfas no 
r using one of three transition methods the modified prospective method  a variation of the modified prospective method  or the modified retrospective method 
the provisions of this statement are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after june  we adopted sfas no 
r  as required  on january   and it did not have a significant financial impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
in pursuing our business plan  the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
consistent with our liability management objectives  we have implemented an interest rate risk management policy based on match funding  with the objective that variable rate assets be primarily financed by variable rate liabilities and fixed rate assets be primarily financed by fixed rate liabilities 
we also seek to match fund our foreign denominated assets with foreign denominated debt so that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will have a minimal impact on earnings 
our operating results will depend in part on the difference between the interest and related income earned on our assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
competition from other providers of real estate financing may lead to a decrease in the interest rate earned on our interest bearing assets  which we may not be able to offset by obtaining lower interest costs on our borrowings 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the financial markets may affect the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
any significant compression of the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could  among other things  reduce the value of our interest bearing assets and our ability to realize gains from the sale of such assets  and a decrease in interest rates could reduce the average life of our interest earning assets if borrowers refinance our loans 
approximately half of our loan investments are subject to significant prepayment protection in the form of lock outs  yield maintenance provisions or other prepayment premiums which provide substantial yield protection to us 
those assets generally not subject to prepayment penalties include variable rate loans based on libor  originated or acquired at par  which would not result in any gain or loss upon repayment  and discount loans and loan participations acquired at discounts to face values  which would result in gains upon repayment 
further  while we generally seek to enter into loan investments which provide for substantial prepayment protection  in the event of declining interest rates  we could receive such prepayments and may not be able to reinvest such proceeds at favorable returns 
such prepayments could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rate risks while we have not experienced any significant credit losses  in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us which adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions  and other factors beyond the control of the company 
as more fully discussed in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  we employ match funding based financing and hedging strategies to limit the effects of changes in interest rates on our operations  including engaging in interest rate caps  floors  swaps and other interest rate related derivative contracts 
these strategies are specifically designed to reduce our exposure  on specific transactions or on a portfolio basis  to changes in cash flows as a result of interest rate movements in the market 
we do not enter into derivative contracts for speculative purposes or as a hedge against changes in credit risk of our borrowers or of the company itself 
each interest rate cap or floor agreement is a legal contract between us and a third party the counterparty 
when we purchase a cap or floor contract  we make an up front payment to the counterparty and the counterparty agrees to make payments to us in the future should the reference rate typically one  three or six month libor rise above cap agreements or fall below floor agreements the strike rate specified in the contract 
each contract has a notional face amount 
should the reference rate rise above the contractual strike rate in a cap  we will earn cap income 
should the reference rate fall below the contractual strike rate in a floor  we will earn floor income 
payments on an annualized basis will equal the contractual notional face amount multiplied by the difference between the actual reference rate and the contracted strike rate 
we utilize the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to such instruments 
sfas no 
provides that the up front fees paid on option based products such as caps be expensed into earnings based on the allocation of the premium to the affected periods as if the agreement were a series of caplets 
these allocated premiums are then reflected as a charge to income and are included in interest expense on the company s consolidated statements of operations in the affected period 
interest rate swaps are agreements in which a series of interest rate flows are exchanged over a prescribed period 
the notional amount on which swaps are based is not exchanged 
our swaps are either pay fixed swaps involving the exchange of variable rate interest payments from the counterparty for fixed interest payments from us or pay floating swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate interest payments from the counterparty for variable rate interest payments from us  which mitigates the risk of changes in fair value of our fixed rate debt obligations 
interest rate futures are contracts  generally settled in cash  in which the seller agrees to deliver on a specified future date the cash equivalent of the difference between the specified price or yield indicated in the contract and the value of the specified instrument ie  ie treasury securities upon settlement 
under these agreements  we would generally receive additional cash flow at settlement if interest rates rise and pay cash if interest rates fall 
the effects of such receipts or payments would be deferred and amortized over the term of the specific related fixed rate borrowings 
in the event that  in the opinion of management  it is no longer probable that a forecasted transaction will occur under terms substantially equivalent to those projected  we would cease recognizing such transactions as hedges and immediately recognize related gains or losses based on actual settlement or estimated settlement value 
while a reit may freely utilize derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risk on its liabilities  the use of derivatives for other purposes  including hedging asset related risks such as credit  foreign exchange  prepayment or interest rate exposure on our loan assets  could generate income which is not qualified income for purposes of maintaining reit status 
as a consequence  we may only engage in such instruments to hedge such risks on a limited basis 
there can be no assurance that our profitability will not be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
in addition  hedging transactions using derivative instruments involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  legal enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
with regard to loss of basis in a hedging contract  indices upon which contracts are based may be more or less variable than the indices upon which the hedged assets or liabilities are based  thereby making the hedge less effective 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
we are potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  because of their high credit ratings  we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and that we will ultimately realize an economic benefit from any hedging contract we enter into which exceeds the related costs incurred in connection with engaging in such hedges 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net investment income and net fair value of financial instruments should interest rates increase or decrease or basis points  assuming no change in the shape of the yield curve ie  relative interest rates 
net investment income is calculated as revenue from loans and other lending investments and operating leases and equity in earnings of joint ventures as of december   less interest expense  operating costs on ctl assets and loss on early extinguishment of debt  for the year ended december  net fair value of financial instruments is calculated as the sum of the value of derivative instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets  less cash out flows in respect to interest bearing liabilities as of december  the cash flows associated with our assets are calculated based on management s best estimate of expected payments for each loan based on loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history  prepayment penalty  term and collateral type 
many of our loans are protected from prepayment as a result of prepayment penalties  yield maintenance fees or contractual terms which prohibit prepayments during specified periods 
however  for those loans where prepayments are not currently precluded by contract  declines in interest rates may increase prepayment speeds 
the base interest rate scenario assumes the one month libor rate of as of december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
net fair value of financial instruments in the table below does not include ctl assets approximately of total assets and certain forms of corporate finance investments but includes debt associated with the financing of these assets 
therefore  the table below is not a meaningful representation of the estimated percentage change in net fair value of financial instruments with change in interest rates 
the estimated percentage change in net investment income does include operating lease income from ctl assets and therefore is a more accurate representation of the impact of changes in interest rates on net investment income
