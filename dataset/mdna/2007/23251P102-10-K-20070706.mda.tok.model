vns therapy epilepsy indication overview epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by recurrent seizures that are categorized as either partial or generalized at onset 
patients who continue to have unsatisfactory seizure control or intolerable side effects after treatment with appropriate antiepileptic therapies for a reasonable period of time are said to suffer from refractory epilepsy 
for reasons that are not clear  partial onset seizures are generally more refractory to existing therapies than generalized seizures 
epilepsy is the second most prevalent neurological disorder 
it is estimated that approximately million individuals in the us have epilepsy  with approximately  new cases diagnosed each year  and that there are in excess of million individuals with epilepsy in western europe with over  new cases diagnosed each year 
in addition  it is estimated that approximately of patients with epilepsy suffer from partial onset seizures and that over of these patients continue to suffer from seizures in spite of treatment with antiepileptic drugs 
the medical  psychological  sociological and financial implications of refractory epilepsy can be profound for individuals and their families 
medical consequences may include brain damage from recurrent seizures  injuries and accidents associated with the loss or impairment of consciousness and death 
personal implications of epilepsy may include suffering the side effects of antiepileptic drugs  strained personal and family relations  and the inability to obtain and hold meaningful employment or a driver s license 
there are two standard types of treatment available to persons with epilepsy drug therapy and surgery 
antiepileptic drugs serve as a first line treatment and are prescribed for virtually all individuals being treated for epilepsy 
when drug therapy is not effective  surgical resection may be an option for some patients 
there are a number of other treatments under development for the treatment of epilepsy  including direct deep brain stimulation dbs and the responsive neurostimulator system rns tm  but these treatments are not currently approved for commercial distribution 
vns therapy for epilepsy the vns therapy system is indicated as an adjunctive treatment for patients who are refractory to antiepileptic drugs 
in the two randomized  parallel  double blind  active controlled studies that led to fda approval of the epilepsy indication  the patients who received adjunctive vns therapy had a mean seizure reduction of approximately and during the three month acute phase of the studies 
additionally  many patients  including some who reported no change or an increase in seizure frequency  also reported a reduction in seizure severity 
long term follow up data  derived from an uncontrolled protocol  on the patients in five studies showed that efficacy was maintained and  for many patients  improved over time during treatment with the vns therapy system 
analysis of the pooled data showed that the median percent seizure reduction was after months of treatment and was sustained at that level at months 
in the treatment of refractory epilepsy  the side effects associated with the vns therapy system are generally mild  localized and related to the period of time in which stimulation is activated 
the side effects include voice alteration  neck discomfort  increased cough  shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing 
the vns therapy system has not typically been associated with the debilitating central nervous system side effects that frequently accompany antiepileptic drugs 
additionally  side effects typically decrease over time 
to date  over  patients have accumulated in excess of  patient years of treatment experience with the vns therapy system 
vns therapy depression indication overview major depressive disorder is one of the most prevalent and serious illnesses in the us it affects nearly million americans years of age or older every year 
recently published data indicate that approximately one 
table of contents third of patients with major depressive disorder will not achieve a remission of their depressive symptoms after four acute treatment steps using standard therapies 
depression is the second leading cause of disability for the general population and is the leading cause of disability for american women 
depression interferes with a person s ability to function  feel pleasure or maintain interest in everyday living 
it is associated with increased mortality due to suicide and co morbid general medical conditions 
total annual costs for depression in the us are estimated to exceed billion  including billion in annual direct treatment costs 
standard treatment modalities for depression include antidepressant drugs  psychotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy ect 
first line therapy often consists of an antidepressant drug 
for patients who do not respond adequately to initial antidepressant treatment  physicians will often switch to a different drug or use two drugs in combination 
physicians usually reserve ect for patients who have not had an adequate response to multiple trials of antidepressant drugs or when they determine a rapid response to treatment is desirable 
there are a number of other treatments under development for the treatment of trd  including repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation rtms and dbs  but these treatments are not currently approved for commercial distribution 
vns therapy for depression the vns therapy system is indicated as an adjunctive treatment for patients who have chronic or recurrent treatment resistant depression 
in canada and the european union  the indication for use also encompasses patients who do not tolerate standard treatment 
fda approved the trd indication for the vns therapy system based on a long term uncontrolled trial the pivotal trial of adjunctive vns therapy that showed significant  sustained improvement of depressive symptoms over one and two years  and based on a comparison of the month outcomes in the pivotal trial with the month outcomes among a non randomized  but well matched  group of patients who received only standard treatments for their trd 
after one year of adjunctive vns therapy in the pivotal trial  response to treatment ranged from to depending on the outcome measure 
moreover  of the patients who responded after three months of adjunctive vns therapy were still responders at one year and of the three month responders were responders at the two year evaluation 
for those patients who were responders at the one year evaluation  were still responders at the two year evaluation 
vns therapy was generally well tolerated in the depression clinical studies 
the most commonly reported adverse events were similar to those observed in patients being treated with vns therapy for epilepsy and included voice alteration  neck discomfort  increased cough  shortness of breath and difficulty swallowing 
these side effects tended to occur during stimulation  tended to be reported as mild or moderate and tended to be reported less frequently over time 
fda post approval study commitments and other clinical research studies as a condition of approval for the vns therapy system trd indication  the fda is requiring us to conduct two post approval studies 
one is a patient randomized  controlled study that compares outcomes for different levels of vagus nerve stimulation 
the other is a patient registry that will include  patients treated with adjunctive vns therapy 
both studies are actively enrolling patients 
to maintain timely progress in the patient dosing study  we announced a program in early whereby we are donating the vns therapy systems and paying for the surgical implantation of the devices at a negotiated rate for patients being enrolled in the study 
we are also sponsoring post marketing studies in refractory epilepsy  and we are supporting a variety of mechanism of actions studies to improve the fundamental understanding of how vns therapy works 
we expect to continue to invest in similar research activities as appropriate 
vns therapy system vns therapy is the first treatment approved by fda for both medically refractory epilepsy and trd 
the safety profiles for vns therapy and the vns therapy system  including the implant procedure  are well established in clinical studies of refractory epilepsy and trd and in commercial use in over  patients with over  total patient years of experience 
the vns therapy system is a proprietary  integrated system consisting of an implantable generator that delivers an electrical signal to an implantable lead attached to the left vagus nerve 
the vagus nerve is the longest of the cranial nerves  extending from the brain stem through the neck to organs in the chest and abdomen 
the left vagus nerve has been shown to have influence over numerous areas of the brain 
preclinical studies and mechanism 
table of contents of action research suggest that intermittent stimulation of the left vagus nerve in the neck modulates a number of structures and alters blood flow bilaterally in several areas of the brain 
these studies have also shown that stimulation of the left cervical vagus nerve is effective in blocking seizures and results in persistent or carryover antiepileptic effects  which increase with chronic intermittent stimulation 
the mechanism of action research associated with our trd studies has shown stimulation of the left vagus nerve results in modulation of areas of the brain thought to be important in the regulation of mood 
the vns therapy system consists of a pulse generator  a bipolar lead  a programming wand and software and a tunneling tool 
the pulse generator and bipolar lead are surgically implanted in a procedure that takes from to minutes  during which time the patient is under general  regional or local anesthesia 
the pulse generator is surgically implanted in a subcutaneous pocket in the upper left chest 
the bipolar lead is connected to the pulse generator and attached to the vagus nerve in the lower left side of the patient s neck 
the patient is generally admitted to the hospital on the day of surgery and discharged the same or following day 
the vns therapy system delivers vns on a chronic  intermittent basis 
the initial standard stimulation parameters that we typically recommend are a second period of stimulation  which we refer to as on time  followed by a five minute period without stimulation  which we refer to as off time 
to optimize patient treatment  the current pulse width  amplitude and frequency and stimulation on and off intervals of the pulse generator can be programmed non invasively and adjusted by the treating physician with a personal or handheld computer using our programming wand and software 
in addition  the patient can use a small  handheld magnet provided with the pulse generator to manually activate or deactivate stimulation 
on demand therapy can be useful for those epilepsy patients who sense an oncoming seizure and has been reported by a number of patients to abort or reduce the severity or duration of seizures 
the magnet can also be used to provide patient control of stimulation side effects by allowing the patient to deactivate stimulation temporarily 
pulse generator 
the pulse generator is an implantable  programmable signal generator designed to be coupled with the bipolar lead to deliver electrical signals to the vagus nerve 
the pulse generator is a battery powered device 
upon depletion of the battery  the pulse generator is removed and a new generator is implanted in a short  outpatient procedure using local anesthesia 
bipolar lead 
the bipolar lead conveys the electrical signal from the pulse generator to the vagus nerve 
the lead incorporates electrodes  which are self sizing and flexible  minimizing mechanical trauma to the nerve and allowing body fluid interchange within the nerve structure 
the lead s two electrodes and anchor tether wrap around the vagus nerve and the connector end is tunneled subcutaneously to the chest where it attaches to the pulse generator 
the leads are available in two sizes of inner spiral diameter to ensure optimal electrode placement on different size nerves 
programming wand and software 
our programming wand and proprietary software are used to interrogate the device and to transmit programming information from a personal or handheld computer to the pulse generator via electromagnetic signals 
programming capabilities include modification of the pulse generator s programmable parameters pulse width  amplitude  frequency and on and off intervals and storage and retrieval of telemetry data 
tunneling tool 
the tunneling tool is a single use  sterile  disposable surgical tool designed to be used during surgical placement of the bipolar lead 
the tool is used for subcutaneous tunneling of the lead assembly between the nerve site in the neck and the pulse generator site in the chest 
accessory pack 
the accessory pack includes two resistor assemblies used to test the function of the device prior to implantation  the bipolar lead tie downs and one hex screwdriver 
the implant procedure  including the cost of the device approximately  for a model vns therapy system  hospital charges and physician fees  generally costs between  and  manufacturing and sources of supply our manufacturing operations are required to comply with fda s quality system regulation qsr  which incorporates the agency s former good manufacturing practices regulations 
the qsr is promulgated under 
table of contents section of the food  drug and cosmetic act 
it requires that manufacturers have a quality system for the design and production of medical devices 
the regulation also requires that various specifications and controls be established for devices  devices be designed under a quality system to meet these specifications  devices be manufactured under a quality system  finished devices meet these specifications  devices be correctly installed  checked and serviced  quality data be analyzed to identify and correct quality problems  and complaints be processed 
thus  the qsr helps assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended use 
in addition  certain international markets have regulatory  quality assurance and manufacturing requirements that may be more or less rigorous than those in the us specifically  we have authorized kema registered quality  inc kema to ensure that we are in compliance with the requirements of international standards organization  medical devices quality management systems requirements for regulatory purposes and the european council directive cee relating to active implantable medical devices aimd 
kema is a notified body within the scope and framework of the european council directive cee relating to aimd 
we are audited by kema on an annual basis for such compliance 
the model and r vns therapy pulse generators  the only pulse generators we currently offer in the us  are similar in design and manufacture to a cardiac pacemaker 
the model and r generators are comprised of one printed circuit board and a battery hermetically sealed in a titanium case 
standard components are assembled on printed circuit boards using surface mount technology 
the assembled circuit boards are then tested and mounted with the battery in the titanium case  which is laser welded 
a header to which the bipolar lead connects is added and each unit is subject to final release testing prior to being sterilized 
marketing and sales united states we market and sell our products for refractory epilepsy and treatment resistant depression through a direct sales force in the us our sales and marketing plan focuses on creating awareness and demand for the vns therapy system among epileptologists and neurologists who treat refractory epilepsy  psychiatrists who treat trd  implanting surgeons  nurses  third party payers  hospitals  patients and their families 
to reach each of these groups  we are using a specialized sales force consisting of sales personnel with medical device  pharmaceutical  or nursing experience  reimbursement specialists experienced in obtaining third party coverage and payments for new medical technologies  account executives and field clinical engineers experienced in obtaining  training and maintaining adequate surgical capacity for implanting the vns therapy system  marketing teams experienced in educational and promotional marketing programs  and case managers experienced in patient education  insurance verification and authorization issues 
in addition to our direct selling activities  we facilitate and support peer to peer interactions such as symposia  conference presentations  journal articles and patient support groups to provide experienced clinicians and patients the opportunity to share their perspectives on the vns therapy system with others 
in july  fda approved vns therapy as a long term adjunctive treatment for patients years of age or older with chronic or recurrent treatment resistant depression in a major depressive episode and who have not 
table of contents responded to at least four adequate antidepressant treatments 
throughout fiscal  we focused the efforts of our organization on the us launch in trd  and we structured our sales and case management organization to support anticipated sales demand in both the epilepsy and depression markets 
although patient and physician demand was strong  our actual sales did not increase to the extent anticipated due to a particularly challenging reimbursement environment 
in fiscal  we did not experience and do not anticipate any meaningful sales growth in trd until such time as we obtain favorable coverage policies for vns therapy in trd 
international we market and sell our products in countries through a combination of a direct sales force in certain european countries and distributors elsewhere 
the vns therapy system is currently sold by a direct sales force in austria  belgium  denmark  france  germany  italy  luxemburg  the netherlands  norway  spain  sweden  switzerland and the united kingdom 
we have distribution agreements with independent distributors covering a number of other countries  principally in europe  asia  south africa  australia  mexico  south america and canada 
the distribution agreements generally grant the distributor exclusive rights for the particular territory for a period of three years 
the distributor generally assumes responsibility for obtaining regulatory and reimbursement approvals for such territory and agrees to certain minimum marketing and sales expenditures and purchase commitments 
under the terms of the distributor agreements  no product return rights are granted to the distributor and no additional product performance issues exist for us after shipment to the distributor 
pricing is generally fixed under the terms of the distribution agreements  but may change at our election  with as little as days prior notice under most agreements 
sales incentives  if provided  are recorded as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
third party reimbursement our ability to expand successfully the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable coding  reimbursement and coverage for the implant procedure and follow up care 
in fiscal  the coding that describes vns related procedures was unchanged and continues to adequately and appropriately describe services of providers 
reimbursement or payment rates were largely unchanged over the past year  with a slight decline in the medicare allowable amount 
in epilepsy  the coverage environment was largely unchanged 
in trd  coverage for vns therapy was difficult to obtain throughout the year 
in deciding to cover a new therapy  payers base their initial coverage decisions on several factors including  but not limited to the status of fda s review of the product  cms s national coverage determinations  as well as local coverage determinations by medicare contractors  bluecross blueshield technology evaluation center recommendations  the product s safety and efficacy  the number of studies performed and peer reviewed articles published with respect to the product  and how the product and therapy compare to alternative therapies 
our reimbursement department is available to assist hospitals and physicians with reimbursement questions 
regional reimbursement managers and case managers are available through our reimbursement hotline  to help with coverage  coding and reimbursement issues on a case by case basis and or policy level 
in epilepsy  virtually all technology assessments are favorable and most payers have coverage policies 
in trd  all the technology assessments are negative  and there are few plans with favorable coverage policies 
medicare effective july   cms issued national coverage policy transmittal cim section 
under the policy  vns therapy is covered for patients with medically refractory partial onset seizures for whom surgery is not recommended or for whom surgery has failed 
in may  cms issued its coverage decision memorandum for 
table of contents vagus nerve stimulation for treatment resistant depression  concluding that medicare coverage is not available for vns therapy as a treatment for trd 
for additional information  see general above 
medicaid medicaid programs generally cover hospital inpatient and outpatient services that are medically necessary and appropriate 
in epilepsy  most state medicaid agencies have developed their own coverage policy for vns therapy or have adopted the national cms coverage policy 
in trd  a small number of medicaid programs provide coverage for vns therapy on a case by case basis  but most are still evaluating a coverage policy or have issued a non coverage policy 
cms s non coverage determination on medicare coverage for the treatment of trd will make gaining coverage with medicaid programs more difficult 
medicaid reimbursement mechanisms vary state by state 
medicaid policy and payment methodologies change on a regular basis  so vigilant and ongoing work is necessary to ensure continued access and acceptable reimbursement for patients covered by medicaid programs 
reimbursement codes are already in place to pay for the cost of the device implantation and the surgeon implant fees  both of which are identical in the treatment of refractory epilepsy and trd 
existing prescriber codes for device interrogation and dosage adjustment currently cover medical professionals in the epilepsy medical community 
private payers private payers generally cover hospital inpatient and outpatient services that are considered to be medically necessary 
currently  private payers commercial  managed care and other third party payers account for to of patients implanted with the vns therapy system 
as with other payers  many private payers have developed clinical guidelines for coverage or adopted the national cms coverage policy for use of vns therapy in epilepsy 
as of the end of fiscal year  coverage for vns therapy for trd is very limited 
only a few plans have issued favorable coverage policies for vns therapy in trd  and less than are providing coverage on a case by case basis 
most plans have either no policy or a non coverage policy 
following the may cms national non coverage determination for trd  we may have difficulty expanding or even maintaining coverage among private payers 
while we believe the clinical evidence supporting vns therapy for trd should be adequate to convince private payers to provide coverage over the long term  coverage approval is subject to each payer s assessment program 
we are actively working with private payers to gain approval of coverage for vns therapy in trd  but we cannot give any assurances that private payers will expand or maintain coverage for vns therapy in trd 
payment rates vary among third party plans based on contracts and payment methods of specific providers 
audits of providers have revealed that the average reimbursement rates for vns therapy related procedures are generally acceptable to the providers 
although the vns therapy system has been approved for commercial distribution in european union countries and canada for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression  we do not anticipate significant sales volumes until reimbursement approvals are achieved in these countries 
we are continuing to pursue appropriate reimbursement approvals in these countries 
product development our product development efforts are directed toward improving the vns therapy system and developing new products that provide additional features and functionality while improving cost effectiveness 
in may  we received approval from kema medical  our european regulatory notified body  to market our demipulse tm and demipulse duo tm vns therapy system generators in the member countries of the european union for the approved epilepsy and depression indications for use 
the demipulse tm generator is the next generation single connector vns therapy system generator for use in new patients  and the demipulse duo tm generator is the next generation dual connector vns therapy system generator for use in patients who have elected replacement of their previous dual connector generator at the end of its battery life 
both the demipulse tm and demipulse duo tm generators are capable of delivering greater functionality and are smaller and 
table of contents lighter than the previous models 
we submitted the premarket approval application supplement pma s for both the demipulse tm and the demipulse duo tm generators to fda in january and initiated limited release in europe in may we anticipate fda approval during the latter half of and commercial release prior to the end of the vns therapy perennia tm lead was approved by fda in may and by kema medical in august the lead is currently in a limited commercial release 
functionally  the new lead is the same as its reliable predecessor  the model lead  but it incorporates a new design and is constructed from more durable components 
mechanical tests conducted in a laboratory setting have shown the perennia tm lead to be more robust than its predecessor 
we received approval for model  version software from kema in may and from fda in june we are conducting ongoing product development programs to enhance the vns therapy system pulse generator  the bipolar lead and programming software 
we will be required to file for the appropriate us and international regulatory approvals  and some projects may require clinical trials  in connection with the introduction of new and improved products 
competition we believe that in the fields of refractory epilepsy and trd  existing and future drug therapies are and will continue to be the primary competition for the vns therapy system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies for the treatment of partial seizures and trd 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to conduct clinical studies involving an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe for the treatment of neurological disorders including depression  and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor and parkinson s disease 
we could also face competition from other large medical device and pharmaceutical companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we have 
in addition  the healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy or trd than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques could make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel antiepileptic and depression drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy could render the vns therapy system noncompetitive or obsolete 
we believe that the primary competitive factors within the epilepsy and trd treatment markets are the efficacy and safety of the treatment relative to alternative therapies  physician and patient acceptance of the product and procedure  availability of third party reimbursement for the treatment of epilepsy  quality of life improvements and product reliability 
we also believe that the vns therapy system compares favorably with competitive products as to these factors 
while no other therapies have been specifically approved for trd  a well established array of antidepressant drugs  typically combined with other antidepressants of complementary action or with atypical antipsychotic drugs and or mood stabilizers  are frequently used for refractory patients 
for severe patients or those at acute risk for suicide  ect is often used 
these treatment modalities may pose a competitive threat in the near term  to the extent that they may delay a decision to offer vns therapy to trd patients 
as other forms of neurostimulation are investigated and developed for trd  these may emerge as competition for vns patient candidates 
less invasive procedures like rtms and mst magnetic seizure therapy may compete for a similar place in the trd treatment algorithm 
more invasive technology like dbs is also being investigated for trd 
finally  ect is undergoing refinements in technique to increase specificity and reduce the cognitive deficit side effects  if successful  the tolerability and patient acceptance of ect could improve in the future 
these neurostimulation techniques could prove to be more effective  more predictable  or have a more rapid onset of antidepressant activity than vns therapy 

table of contents we face similar competition with respect to the development and sale of vns therapy as a treatment for the other disorders we are evaluating  including  but not limited to alzheimer s disease  anxiety disorders and bulimia 
patents  licenses and proprietary rights proprietary protection for our products is important to our business 
we maintain a policy of seeking method and device patents on our inventions  acquiring licenses under selected patents of third parties  and entering into invention and confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants with respect to technology that we consider important to our business 
we also rely on trade secrets  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we have an exclusive license agreement with jacob zabara  phd  a co founder and consultant to us  pursuant to which we currently maintain exclusive licenses on five us method patents and such international counterparts as have been or may be issued covering the vns therapy system for vagus nerve and other cranial nerve stimulation for the control of movement disorders including epilepsy  neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and other disorders 
we believe that these patents give us an advantage by limiting competition in vagus nerve stimulation to treat refractory epilepsy and trd 
the license agreement will give us coverage until expiration of the licensed patents in july for movement disorders and may for neuropsychiatric disorders 
pursuant to the license agreement  we are obligated to pay dr 
zabara a royalty equal to of net sales through july  after which royalties will be reduced to for the duration of any remaining patents covering licensed products 
we have an agreement with mitchell s 
roslin  md on two md patents that we co own with dr 
roslin for bilateral vns for the treatment of obesity 
pursuant to the agreement  we are obligated to pay dr 
roslin a royalty rate of of the first million of net obesity sales covered by one of the patents and of net obesity sales thereafter 
pursuant to the agreement  we paid dr 
roslin advances on royalties in the amount of  per year for five years beginning january   and we will be obligated to pay  upon the completion of certain milestones  up to  in additional advances on royalties 
including the patents referred to in the agreements described above  as of april   we owned or licensed us patents and pending us patent applications  covering various aspects of the vns therapy system  potential improvements to the vns therapy system and methods of treatment for a variety of disorders through electrical stimulation of the vagus nerve or other cranial nerves 
in addition to movement disorders  other method patents cover the fields of eating disorders including obesity and bulimia  endocrine disorders  migraine headaches  dementia  neuropsychiatric disorders including depression and anxiety disorders  motility disorders  sleep disorders  coma  chronic pain  cardiac disorders and hypertension 
we have filed counterparts of certain of our key us patent applications in certain key international jurisdictions and currently own or license patents issued by the european patent office or other international authorities and patent applications pending in the european patent office or before other international authorities 
we cannot assure you that patents will issue from any of the pending applications or if patents issue  that they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology 
notwithstanding the scope of the patent protection available to us  a competitor could develop treatment methods or devices that are not covered by our patents 
we believe that the patents we own and license provide us with protection in the us in the field of cranial nerve stimulation  including vns for the control of epilepsy and other movement disorders  including parkinson s disease and essential tremor  neuropsychiatric disorders including clinical depression  eating disorders  anxiety disorders  obesity  dementia including alzheimer s disease and additional indications for which method patents have been issued 
the protection provided by our international patents is not as strong as that provided by our us patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  european and other countries prohibit patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
in the future  we may need to engage in litigation to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect our trade secrets or know how or to defend us against claims of infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation could be costly and could divert our 
table of contents attention from other functions and responsibilities 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the vns therapy system  any of which could severely harm our business 
we are not currently a party to any patent litigation or other litigation regarding proprietary rights and are not aware of any challenge to our patents or proprietary rights 
product liability and insurance the manufacture and sale of our products subjects us to the risk of product liability claims 
we are currently named as a defendant in two product liability lawsuits alleging negligence  strict liability and breach of warranty 
we likely will be named in the future as a defendant in product liability lawsuits alleging claims of negligence  strict liability  breach of warranty  negligent misrepresentation  failure to warn  wrongful death and other claims 
we do not believe that the vns therapy system is defective or otherwise has caused or will cause injury to patients who are or may be involved in these lawsuits  however  the outcome of litigation is inherently unpredictable and could result in an adverse judgment and an award of substantial and material damages against us 
we establish a liability reserve on our balance sheet in an amount less than our self insured retention for all matters that we believe is probable of payment as a result of a judgment or settlement 
although we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe to be reasonable  coverage limits may prove not to be adequate in some circumstances 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may be available only at significantly higher premiums or not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could severely harm our business and consolidated results of operations and financial position 
we endeavor to maintain executive and organization liability insurance in a form and with aggregate coverage limits that we believe are adequate for our business purposes 
on may   we renewed our executive and organization liability policies through may  employees as of june   we had approximately full time employees 
we believe that the success of our business depends  in part  on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel  could significantly harm our business

our common stock is traded on the nasdaq global market under the ticker symbol cybx 
the price of stock on that trading market fluctuates  and we expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate 
for example  during the fiscal year ended april   our stock traded from a high of to a low of per share 
our stock price may be affected by a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including  without limitation changes in the general conditions of the economy  regulatory activities and announcements  federal and state enforcement initiatives related to medical device companies  changes in market valuations of medical device companies in general  national and regional coverage determinations by third party payers  including private insurance companies  medicare  state medicaid programs and others  results of studies regarding the safety and efficacy of drugs or devices that are potential competitors to our vns therapy system  results of studies regarding the safety and efficacy of our vns therapy treatment for various indications including epilepsy  depression  alzheimer s disease  anxiety and other disorders  quarterly variations in our sales and operating results  announcements of significant contracts  acquisitions or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  additions or departures of key management personnel  risks and costs associated with the previously disclosed inquiries by the sec staff and the us attorney and with any litigation relating thereto or to our stock option grants  procedures and practices  the impact of the restatement of our financial statements and any other actions that might be taken or required as a result of such inquiries  including a default under our credit facility or debt instruments  the potential identification of material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  and uncertainties associated with stockholder derivative litigation 
in addition  the stock market in recent years has experienced broad price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies 
these broad market fluctuations have also adversely affected  and may continue to adversely affect  the market price of our common stock 
we are not profitable now  and we have been profitable for only seven fiscal quarters since our inception

the report of our auditors with respect to their audit of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended april  contains an explanatory paragraph relating to the preparation of our financial statements as a going concern 
while our management expects to resolve the conditions referenced in note going concern in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we can offer no assurance that we will be able to resolve these conditions and continue as a going concern 
in the future  we could have a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
we reported in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended april  form k that management identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
our management concluded that  as a result of this material weakness  our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of april  based upon the criteria issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission 
this material weakness resulted in the material misstatement of stock based compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for the and fiscal years and each of the quarters of fiscal and and we restated previously issued financial statements for the and fiscal years and each of the quarters of fiscal years and we have successfully remediated this material weakness 
however  if management determines or our independent registered public accountants conclude that we have a material weakness in the future  it could adversely affect our credit rating  lead to short term price volatility  trigger an investigation by a regulatory authority or result in additional stockholder litigation  any of which could severely harm our business  our consolidated financial position and results of operations

our quarterly revenues  expenses and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons  including  without limitation the extent to which the vns therapy system gains market acceptance  the timing of obtaining marketing approvals for the vns therapy system for other indications  if any  the existence and timing of any approvals or non coverage determinations for reimbursement by third party payers  the rate and size of expenditures incurred as we expand our clinical  manufacturing  sales  marketing and product development efforts  our ability to retain qualified sales personnel  the availability of key components  materials and contract services  which depends on our ability to forecast sales among other things  investigations of our business and business related activities by regulatory or other governmental authorities  product recalls or safety alerts  and litigation  including product liability  securities class action  stockholder derivative  general commercial and other lawsuits 
as a result of any of these factors  our consolidated results of operations may fluctuate significantly and may be below security analyst expectations  which may in turn cause our stock price to decline 
we may fail to comply with one or more of the many regulations that govern our business activities 
we are subject to extensive and rigorous ongoing regulation of the research  development  testing  manufacture  labeling  promotion  advertising  distribution and marketing of our product 
our failure to comply with regulations or to identify and resolve manufacturing or safety problems prior to commercial marketing could lead to the need for product marketing restrictions  product withdrawal or recall or other voluntary or regulatory action  any 
table of contents of which could delay further marketing until our product is brought into compliance 
our failure to comply with these requirements could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results and may also subject us to stringent penalties and lawsuits 
our indebtedness and debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow  cash position and stock price 
as of april   we had approximately million in convertible debt with aggregate annual debt service obligations  excluding full repayment of principal  of approximately million and million in outstanding borrowings against our revolving credit facility 
if we issue other securities in the future  our debt service obligations and interest expense will increase further 
we intend to fulfill our debt service obligations from earnings and our existing cash and investments 
in the future  if we are unable to generate cash or raise additional cash through financing sufficient to meet these obligations  we may have to delay or curtail our research  development and commercialization programs 
our indebtedness could have significant additional negative consequences  including  without limitation requiring the dedication of a portion of our cash to service our indebtedness and to pay off the principal at maturity  thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash available for other purposes  including funding our research  development and commercialization efforts and planned capital expenditures  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing  and placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors and competitors with better access to capital resources 
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  holders of our senior subordinated convertible notes may force us to purchase their convertible notes at the full amount owed  including accrued but unpaid interest 
if we undergo a fundamental change  including  but not limited to  the acquisition by any person of the beneficial ownership of of our common stock  our consolidation or merger with or into any other person  our liquidation  or our common stock being removed from listing on the nasdaq global market  holders of our million of senior subordinated convertible notes due in convertible notes may  at their option  require us to purchase their convertible notes for the full amount owed including accrued but unpaid interest 
this amount may be greater than the value of the convertible notes at the time of repurchase 
as a result  the possibility of a repurchase requirement may inhibit the consummation of certain transactions such as mergers that may be beneficial to our stockholders 
upon the occurrence of certain events  the initial conversion rate of our convertible notes will be adjusted  which could result in an increased number of shares being issued upon conversion 
the initial conversion rate of our convertible notes will be adjusted upon the occurrence of certain events  including  among others  the issuance to our stockholders of certain rights to purchase our common stock at less than the current market price of our common stock or the issuance of cash dividends to substantially all of our stockholders 
if the conversion rate is adjusted  holders of our convertible notes will receive a greater number of shares of our common stock per convertible note  resulting in increased percentage ownership of our common stock by the noteholders 
we may be forced to repay the full amount of our outstanding million convertible note indebtedness and senior credit indebtedness on an accelerated basis 
in july  we received a notice of default and demand letter notice of default from wells fargo bank  national association the trustee  pursuant to which the trustee asserted that we were in default of our obligations under the indenture dated september  indenture  between us  as issuer  and the trustee with respect to our convertible notes  as a result of our failure to file with the sec our form k by july  and to deliver a copy of the form k to the trustee by july  in october  we received a notice of 
table of contents acceleration and demand letter notice of acceleration from the trustee informing us that  pursuant to the indenture  the trustee has declared the convertible notes due and payable at their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest  and fees and expenses and demanding that all such principal  interest  fees and expenses under the convertible notes be paid to the trustee immediately 
as a result  although the convertible notes mature in  we have included them as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet as of april  we deny that a default occurred under the indenture  and on june   a federal district court granted summary judgment to cyberonics and declared that no default occurred under the indenture 
in its court filings  the trustee stated that it was seeking approximately million in damages plus interest and attorney fees  but it reserved the right to seek immediate payment of full value of the convertible notes 
the trustee has not appealed the district court s decision  however  if the trustee appeals the decision of the district court  and if the court of appeals reverses the district court s decision and determines that a default occurred  then all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes could be due and payable immediately unless we negotiate an amendment to the terms of the indenture 
in addition  a default under the indenture constitutes a default under our credit agreement dated january  credit agreement with merrill lynch capital  a division of merrill lynch business financial services inc administrative agent and the lenders who are party thereto lenders 
if the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes and our outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement must be repaid immediately  we may not have or be able to obtain access to the funds needed to repay the indebtedness  and we may be forced to seek protection under the us bankruptcy code 
we may not be able to access sufficient additional capital sources or to access capital on terms which are acceptable to us 
our capital requirements are substantial and depend on many factors  including market acceptance of our product and clinical and strategic development opportunities 
a large portion of our expenses is currently fixed  including expenses related to our facilities  equipment and personnel  and we may need to spend significant amounts to conduct our post marketing clinical studies or for product improvement and development 
we will need to generate significant additional revenues to achieve profitability in the future 
even if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
furthermore  if additional capital is required  we may not be able to access sufficient sources or to access capital on terms which are acceptable to us 
we may not be successful in our efforts to develop vns therapy for the treatment of other indications and  as such  we may not experience revenue growth from these other indications 
we have conducted or supported animal studies or small human pilot studies for the treatment of a number of therapeutic indications beyond refractory epilepsy and trd 
regulatory approval for any likely new indications would require us to conduct one or more larger scale pivotal trials 
we have not conducted such pivotal trials for any indication beyond refractory epilepsy and trd  nor do we have any immediate plans to do so 
in the event that we do invest in future studies for new indications  we cannot assure you that our study results will be positive 
if we elect not to conduct research with regard to new indications  our study results are not positive  we do not receive additional regulatory approvals  or alternative indications do not prove to be commercially viable  our revenue growth  if any  would be limited to revenue from our existing approved indications in refractory epilepsy and trd 
we may not be able to expand or maintain market acceptance of the use of the vns therapy system to treat epilepsy or depression  which could cause our sales to be lower than expectations 
our product portfolio is limited to vns therapy systems for two indications  refractory epilepsy and trd 
market acceptance of the vns therapy system for these indications depends on our ability to convince the medical community and third party payers of the clinical efficacy and safety of vagus nerve stimulation and the vns therapy system 
on may   cms issued a national non coverage determination with respect to vns therapy for trd 
prior to the non coverage determination  some patients were able to obtain coverage on a case by case basis through their local medicare contractor or fiscal intermediary 
since the national non coverage determination is binding on all local medicare contractors  patients will no longer be able to obtain medicare coverage on a case by case basis 
in addition  cms s non coverage determination may have a detrimental effect on coverage decisions by other payers  including medicaid 
while the vns therapy system has been implanted in more than 
table of contents  patients  many physicians are still unfamiliar with this form of therapy 
we believe that existing pharmacological therapies  surgery for refractory epilepsy and ect for trd are the only other approved and currently available therapies competitive with the vns therapy system 
these therapies may be more attractive to patients or their physicians than the vns therapy system in terms of efficacy  cost or reimbursement availability 
furthermore  we have not funded significant post market clinical research that could change physicians opinions or use of our product for refractory epilepsy 
we cannot assure you that we will receive broad reimbursement coverage for trd or that our sales will increase for epilepsy or trd 
additionally  we cannot assure you that the vns therapy system will achieve expanded market acceptance for the treatment of epilepsy  depression or for any other indication 
failure of the vns therapy system to gain additional market acceptance would severely harm our business  our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we may not be successful in our marketing and sales efforts  which could severely harm our business 
we launched vns therapy for trd in august following expansion of our sales and case management organization to support anticipated sales demand in both epilepsy and trd markets 
although patient demand has been strong  our sales have not increased to the extent we anticipated in august at the present time  we do not expect sales of the vns therapy system for trd to result in any consistent revenue growth until the product receives broader regional or national coverage by insurers and other payers 
in addition  the absence of broad regional or national insurance coverage may have a negative effect on psychiatrists prescribing habits  resulting in decreasing sales of vns therapy systems for trd 
our inability to achieve annual or quarterly revenue growth could substantially harm our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
patient confidentiality and federal and state privacy and security laws and regulations may adversely impact our selling model 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa establishes federal rules protecting the privacy and security of personal health information 
the privacy and security rules address the use and disclosure of individual health care information and the rights of patients to understand and control how such information is used and disclosed 
hipaa provides both criminal and civil fines and penalties for covered entities that fail to comply with hipaa 
we intend to comply with applicable privacy and security standards 
however  if we fail to comply with the applicable regulations  we could suffer civil penalties up to  per calendar year for each violation and criminal penalties with fines up to  and potential imprisonment 
in addition to hipaa  virtually every state has enacted one or more laws to safeguard privacy  and these laws vary significantly from state to state and change frequently 
even if our business model is compliant with the hipaa privacy and security rule and the texas privacy laws  it may not be compliant with the privacy laws of all states 
because the operation of our business involves the collection and use of substantial amounts of protected health information  we endeavor to conduct our business as a covered entity under the hipaa privacy and security rule and consistent with the texas privacy laws  obtaining hipaa compliant patient authorizations where required to support the collection and use of patient information 
we also sometimes act as a business associate for a covered entity 
despite extensive efforts to conduct our business as a covered entity under the hipaa privacy and security rules  the office for civil rights of the department of health and human services or another government enforcement agency may determine that our business model or operations are not in compliance with the hipaa privacy and security rules  which could subject us to penalties  could severely limit our ability to market and sell vns therapy under our existing business model and could harm our business growth and consolidated financial position 
we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate third party reimbursement on our product  which could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
our ability to commercialize the vns therapy system successfully depends  in part  on whether third party payers  including private healthcare insurers  managed care plans  medicare and medicaid programs and others  agree to cover the vns therapy system and associated procedures and services and to reimburse at adequate levels for the costs of the vns therapy system and the related services in the us or internationally 
while we currently have reimbursement approval for epilepsy  we have not yet received substantial reimbursement coverage approval for the treatment of depression 
in may  cms issued a national non coverage determination with respect to vns therapy for trd 

table of contents this non coverage determination means that medicare will not cover vns therapy for trd 
prior to the non coverage determination  some patients were able to obtain coverage on a case by case basis through their local medicare contractor or fiscal intermediary 
since the national non coverage determination is binding on all local medicare contractors  patients will no longer be able to obtain medicare coverage on a case by case basis 
in addition  the cms non coverage determination also may have a detrimental effect on potential and existing coverage by medicaid and private payers 
in addition  periodic changes to reimbursement methodology for medical devices under the medicare and medicaid programs occur and may reduce the rate of increase in federal expenditures for health care costs 
such changes  as well as any future regulatory changes and the failure of the vns therapy system to continue to qualify for reimbursement under these programs  may have an adverse impact on our business 
healthcare  as one of the largest industries in the us  continues to attract substantial legislative interest and public attention 
congress and state legislatures are constantly reassessing the propriety of coverage for various health services and the payment level for such services 
certain reform proposals and other policy shifts  if enacted  could limit coverage for vns therapy or the reimbursement available for vns therapy from governmental agencies or third party payers 
changes in medicare  medicaid and other programs  cost containment initiatives by public and private payers  a failure to obtain substantial regional and national coverage policies for vns therapy in trd  and proposals to limit payments and health care spending could have a significant negative impact on our future operating results 
our current and future expense estimates are based  in large part  on estimates of our future sales  which are difficult to predict 
we may be unable to  or may elect not to  adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected sales shortfall 
if increased expenses are not accompanied by increased sales  our consolidated results of operations and financial position for any particular quarter could be harmed 
if our suppliers and manufacturers are unable to meet our demand for materials  components and contract services  we may be forced to qualify new vendors or change our product design  which would impair our ability to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis 
we rely upon sole source suppliers for certain of the key components  materials and contract services used in manufacturing the vns therapy system 
we periodically experience discontinuation or unavailability of components  materials and contract services  which may require us to qualify alternative sources or  if no such alternative sources are identified  change our product design 
we believe that pursuing and qualifying alternative sources and or redesigning specific components of the vns therapy system  if or when necessary  could consume significant resources 
in addition  such changes generally require regulatory submissions and approvals 
any extended delays in or an inability to secure alternative sources for these or other components  materials and contract services could result in product supply and manufacturing interruptions  which could significantly harm our business 
our products may have defects that result in product recalls  which may result in substantial costs and reduced sales 
the vns therapy system includes an electronic pulse generator and lead designed to be implanted in the human body and a programming wand connected to a handheld computer for programming the pulse generator 
component failures  manufacturing or shipping problems or hardware or software design defects could result in the product not delivering the therapy for which it is indicated or the product delivering a therapy that is not intended 
the occurrence of such problems or other adverse clinical reactions could result in a recall of our products  possibly requiring explantation and potential reimplantation of the vns therapy system  which may increase risk to the patient 
any product recall could result in a substantial loss of physician and patient confidence in our products  with a consequential substantial decrease in sales  and could result in substantial product liability litigation  with liabilities well in excess of our product liability insurance coverage limits  any or all of which could severely harm our business and our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in november  we sent physicians a safety alert letter warning of a rare software anomaly that can cause the vns therapy system pulse generator to deliver an output current of eight milliamps during an interrupted programming session 
this amount of output current is within the range of currents originally approved by the fda 
table of contents as safe and effective  but it is higher than is recommended for use 
we are aware of eight occurrences of this anomaly  among more than  vns therapy systems implanted 
although none of the occurrences was associated with permanent injury to a patient  most resulted in at least temporary discomfort 
fda has classified this anomaly as a class ii recall  which we have addressed by means of the safety alert letter 
if we fail to follow up appropriately regarding distribution of the safety alert letter  we could be subject to regulatory sanctions 
we may not be able to protect our technology from unauthorized use  which could diminish the value of our products and impair our ability to compete 
our success depends upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for the vns therapy system and its improvements 
to that end  we have acquired licenses under certain patents and have patented and intend to continue to seek patents on our own inventions used in our products and treatment methods 
the process of seeking patent protection can be expensive and time consuming  and we cannot assure you that patents will be issued from our currently pending or future applications or that  if patents are issued  they will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us 
further  the protection offered by the licensed international patents is not as strong as that offered by the licensed us patents due to differences in patent laws 
in particular  the european patent convention prohibits patents covering methods for treatment of the human body by surgery or therapy 
without effective patent protection  whether in the us or abroad  we may be subject to competition that negatively affects our business and our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we may engage in litigation to protect our proprietary rights  or defend against infringement claims by third parties  causing us to suffer significant liabilities or expenses or preventing us from selling our products 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to and diversion of effort by us  may be necessary to enforce patents issued or licensed to us  to protect trade secrets or know how owned by us or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
adverse determinations in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling or using the vns therapy system  any of which could severely harm our business 
intense competition and rapid technological changes could reduce our ability to market our products and achieve sales 
we believe that existing and future pharmaceutical therapies will continue to be the primary competition for the vns therapy system 
we may also face competition from other medical device companies that have the technology  experience and capital resources to develop alternative devices for the treatment of epilepsy and depression 
medtronic  inc  for example  continues to conduct clinical studies involving an implantable signal generator used with an invasive deep brain probe  or thalamic stimulator  for the treatment of neurological disorders  including depression  and has received fda approval for the device for the treatment of essential tremor  including that associated with parkinson s disease 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do and have obtained third party reimbursement approvals for their therapies 
we may not have invested in the past  or be investing in the future  sufficient resources in engineering research and development to prepare the vns therapy system for competition in the future with other neurostimulation technologies 
in addition  the healthcare industry is characterized by extensive research efforts and rapid technological progress 
our competitors may develop technologies and obtain regulatory approval for products that are more effective in treating epilepsy and depression than our current or future products 
in addition  advancements in surgical techniques may make surgery a more attractive therapy for epilepsy and depression 
the development by others of new treatment methods with novel drugs  medical devices or surgical techniques for epilepsy and depression could render the vns therapy system non competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including new products and technology  which could severely harm our business and our consolidated financial position and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to claims of product liability and we may not have the resources or insurance to cover the cost for losses under these claims 
the manufacture and sale of the vns therapy system  an implantable medical device  entails the risk of product liability claims  which we have received from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
we may be responsible for large self insured retentions for each claim  and our product liability coverage limit may not be adequate to pay defense costs and judgments that may result from these claims 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may only be available at significantly higher premiums or may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could significantly harm our business and consolidated financial position 
if we do not continue to comply with changing government laws and regulations  we could lose our ability to market and sell our product or be subject to substantial fines or other penalties 
the preclinical and clinical design  testing  manufacturing  labeling  sale  distribution  servicing and promotion of the vns therapy system are subject to extensive and rigorous federal and state laws and regulations  including regulations from the department of health and human services related to medicare  medicaid  hipaa and fda and from comparable state agencies 
in the future  it will be necessary for us to obtain additional government approvals for other indications of the vns therapy system  if we choose to develop new indications  and for modified or future generation products 
it is also necessary for us to ensure that our marketing and sales practices comply with all laws and regulations 
commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is also subject to regulatory approvals from the appropriate authorities in such countries 
the process of obtaining fda and other required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
moreover  regulatory approvals may include regulatory restrictions on the indicated uses for which a product may be marketed 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in  among other things  fines  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  confiscations or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
adverse results in post approval studies may result in limitations on or withdrawal of previously granted approvals 
furthermore  changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining  or affect the timing of  future regulatory approvals 
we may not be able to obtain additional future regulatory approvals on a timely basis or at all 
delays in receipt of or failure to receive such future approvals  suspension or withdrawal of previously received approvals or recalls of the vns therapy system could severely harm our ability to market and sell our current and future products and improvements 
as a condition of approval for the trd indication  the fda has required us to conduct a post approval patient dosing study and a  patient registry of which  will be treated with vns therapy 
the results of these studies may be included in product labeling 
if we fail to complete these studies in a timely manner  we may be subject to regulatory action  including withdrawal of our trd indication approval 
we are subject to federal and state laws governing our sales and marketing practices  and failure to adhere to these laws could result in substantial fines and other penalties 
we are subject to certain laws and regulations  including the federal anti kickback statute  the federal false claims act and the hipaa privacy rule  that govern the sales and marketing practices of healthcare companies 
the anti kickback statute contains both civil and criminal sanctions  which are enforced by the office of the inspector general of health and human services department oig and the us department of justice doj 
over the past several years  the us government has accused an increasing number of pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers of violating the anti kickback statute based on certain marketing and sales practices and compensation arrangements with referral sources 
pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers also have been accused of alleged violations of the federal false claims act  which imposes civil liability including substantial monetary penalties and damages on any person or corporation that knowingly presents a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the us government  knowingly uses a false record or statement to obtain payment or engages in a conspiracy to defraud the federal government to obtain allowance for a false claim 
under the qui tam  or whistleblower  provisions of the false claims act  private parties may bring actions on behalf of the us government 
these private parties are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government through trial or settlement 
both direct enforcement activity by the government and whistleblower lawsuits have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that we may be forced to defend a prosecution under the anti kickback statute  a 
table of contents false claims action  be liable for monetary fines or be excluded from the medicare and medicaid programs as a result of an investigation resulting from an enforcement action or a whistleblower case 
in  we adopted a healthcare law compliance program  including our business practice standards  which is a set of policies that embody the advamed code of ethics for interactions with health care professionals 
in january  we adopted significant revisions to our business practice standards that we believe more thoroughly address our compliance risks 
we endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with our business practice standards and to ensure continued compliance through regular education of our employees  audits of employee activities  and appropriate responses to violations of the business practice standards 
although we believe that these efforts have been successful and that we are in substantial compliance with our policies and the healthcare laws  given the complexity of our business model  including extensive interactions with patients and healthcare professionals  and the large number of field personnel employed by us  violations of our policy and the law could occur 
we could be subject to investigation by the oig or the doj or a comparable state agency 
if investigated  we could be forced to incur substantial expense responding to the investigation and defending our actions 
if unsuccessful in our defense  we could be found to be in violation of the healthcare laws and be subject to substantial fines and penalties  including exclusion of our products from medicare and medicaid reimbursement 
our international operations are subject to risks not generally associated with commercialization efforts in the us we may not be successful in increasing our international sales or in obtaining reimbursement or any regulatory approvals required in foreign countries 
the anticipated international nature of our business is also expected to subject us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or where the vns therapy system is sold 
the regulation of medical devices in a number of such jurisdictions  particularly in the european union  continues to develop and new laws or regulations may impair our ability to market and sell our products in those jurisdictions 
our failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  including key officers  could adversely affect our operations 
in connection with the commercialization of the vns therapy system in the us for trd  we made significant changes to our organization  including an initial scale up in personnel from february through july of approximately and subsequent reductions in personnel of in fiscal and in fiscal such activities have placed  and may continue to place a significant strain on our resources and operations 
our ability to grow in the future will depend upon our ability to attract  hire and retain highly qualified employees and management personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations and we may not be successful in hiring or retaining qualified personnel 
in november  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer resigned  and in may we hired a new chief executive officer and our interim chief financial officer resigned 
these changes in key management positions strain our existing resources  creating a risk of loss of other key employees 
as a result  our business could be affected detrimentally 
we have in the past and are again now involved in an investigation conducted by the staff of the senate finance committee resulting in adverse publicity  expenditure of substantial resources and diversion of management attention  all with an adverse effect on our business 
we received a letter in november and a second letter in march from senator charles grassley on behalf of the united states senate committee on finance sfc requesting our cooperation in providing certain documents and information relating to our employees  agents and consultants regarding their meetings and communications with the cms regarding coverage of the vns therapy system for trd and our agents and consultants participation in presentations  preparation of publications and advice to government agencies on vns therapy for trd 
a discussion of the sfc investigation is contained in note litigation senate finance committee investigation 
we are unable to provide assurance at this time as to any further action that may be taken by the sfc or its staff in regard to this matter

this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about our industry and us 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties affecting these statements  see cautionary statement about forward looking statements as well as item business and item a 
risk factors in this form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
this item provides material historical and prospective disclosures enabling investors and other users to assess our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the consolidated financial statements  excluding the related notes  include the consolidated statements of operations  consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of stockholders equity deficit and comprehensive loss and consolidated statements of cash flows 
the notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements and provide additional information required to fully understand the nature of amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
since inception  we have incurred an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development  clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
for the fiscal years ended april  and april  we had a net loss of million and million  respectively 
to fund our operations  in fiscal  we incurred additional indebtedness through the issuance of million of convertible notes and the establishment of a million line of credit 
in july  we received the notice of default from the trustee  pursuant to which the trustee asserted that we were in default of our obligations under the indenture with respect to our convertible notes as a result of our failure to file with the sec our form k by july  and to deliver a copy of the form k to the trustee by july  in october  we received the notice of acceleration from the trustee informing us that  pursuant to the indenture  the trustee declared the convertible notes due and payable at their principal amount together with accrued and unpaid interest  and fees and expenses and demanding that all such principal  interest  fees and expenses under the convertible notes be paid to the trustee immediately 
we believe that no default occurred under the indenture  and on june   a federal district court granted summary judgment to cyberonics and declared that no default occurred under the indenture 
in its court filings  the trustee stated that it was seeking approximately million in damages plus interest and attorney fees  but it reserved the right to seek immediate payment of full value of the convertible notes 
the trustee has not appealed the district court s decision  however  if the trustee appeals the decision of the district court and if the court of appeals reverses the district court s decision  then all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes could be due and payable immediately 
accordingly  until this matter is resolved  we have included them as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of april  and april  in addition  if a default occurred under the indenture  we would also be in default of the million line of credit 
if principal and interest on our indebtedness must be repaid immediately  we do not have the cash resources available to repay the debt 
if we were not able to renegotiate the terms of the indenture  or to secure additional financing  this could raise substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
business overview we are a neuromodulation company founded to design  develop and bring to market medical devices that provide a unique therapy  vns therapy  for the treatment of epilepsy  trd and other debilitating neurological  psychiatric diseases and other disorders 
the fda approved the vns therapy system in july for use as an adjunctive therapy in patients over years of age in reducing the frequency of partial onset seizures that are 
table of contents refractory or resistant to antiepileptic drugs 
regulatory bodies in canada  europe  south america  africa  india  australia and certain countries in eastern asia have approved vns therapy for the treatment of epilepsy without age restrictions or seizure type limitations 
fda also approved the vns therapy system for the adjunctive long term treatment of chronic or recurrent depression for patients years of age or older who are experiencing a major depressive episode and have not had an adequate response to four or more adequate anti depressant treatments 
regulatory bodies in the european union countries and canada approved the vns therapy system for the treatment of chronic or recurrent depression in patients who are in a treatment resistant or in a treatment intolerant depressive episode without age restrictions 
our ability to expand successfully the commercialization of the vns therapy system depends on obtaining and maintaining favorable coverage  coding and reimbursement for the implant procedure and follow up care 
currently  we have broad coverage  coding and reimbursement for vns therapy for the treatment of epilepsy 
we are actively pursuing favorable coverage decisions to expand reimbursement to include vns therapy for trd 
absent favorable national and regional coverage policies  we have been obtaining certain trd case by case approvals since fda approval in july our long term growth in trd is dependent on our progress in obtaining favorable national and regional coverage policies in trd 
our clinical development program has included pilot and pivotal studies in using vns therapy as an adjunctive therapy for reducing the frequency of seizures in patients over years of age with partial onset seizures that are refractory to antiepileptic drugs and as an adjunctive treatment of patients years of age and older with chronic or recurrent trd in a major depressive episode 
we have also conducted or provided support for small pilot studies for the treatment of alzheimer s disease  anxiety  chronic migraine headache  bulimia and other indications 
these studies have been conducted to determine the safety and effectiveness of vns therapy and to determine which new indications might be considered for pivotal studies and  therefore  are an important component of our clinical research activities 
since inception  we have incurred substantial expenses  primarily for research and development activities that include product and process development and clinical trials and related regulatory activities  sales and marketing activities  manufacturing start up costs and systems infrastructure 
we have also made significant investments in recent periods in connection with sales and marketing activities in the us and clinical research costs associated with new indications development  most notably depression 
for the period from inception through april   we incurred an accumulated net deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate increasing investments in post approval clinical studies in epilepsy and depression 
the primary exchange rate movements that impact our consolidated net sales growth include the us dollar as compared to the euro 
the weakening of the us dollar in fiscal generally has a favorable impact on our sales for the year 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net sales is not indicative of the impact on our operations due to the offsetting foreign currency impact on operating costs and expenses 
related proceedings regulatory proceedings 
in june  the sec staff advised us that it had commenced an informal inquiry of our stock option grants and related practices  procedures and accounting 
in addition  we received a subpoena from the us attorney requesting documents related to the same matters 
for additional information  see note litigation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
legal proceedings 
we are named as a nominal defendant in stockholder derivative lawsuits pending in texas state and federal courts wherein a stockholder purports to pursue claims on our behalf against several of our current and former officers and members of our board of directors 
for additional information  see note litigation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  a putative class action lawsuit was filed against us and certain of our current and former officers in the united states district court for the southern district of texas

table of contents significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis 
our estimates and assumptions are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies as the most significant because  in management s view  they are most important to the portrayal of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and most demanding in terms of requiring estimates and other exercises of judgment 
accounts receivable 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon specific customer risks and a general provision based upon historical trends 
an increase in losses beyond that expected by management or what we have historically experienced would reduce earnings when they become known 
inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  first in  first out fifo method  or market 
cost includes the acquisition cost of raw materials and components  direct labor and overhead 
management considers potential obsolescence at each balance sheet date 
an acceleration of obsolescence could occur if consumer demand differs from expectations 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are carried at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs and minor replacements are charged to expense as incurred  significant renewals  improvements and expansions are capitalized 
for financial reporting purposes  we compute depreciation using the straight line method over useful lives ranging from two to nine years 
an unanticipated change in the utilization or expected useful life of property and equipment could result in acceleration in the timing of the expenses 
revenue recognition 
we sell our products through a combination of a direct sales force in the us and certain european countries and through distributors elsewhere 
we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers  providing there are no remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
we record estimated sales returns and discounts as a reduction of net sales in the same period revenue is recognized 
our revenues are dependent upon sales to new and existing customers pursuant to our current policies 
changes in these policies or sales terms could impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized 
research and development 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we have entered into contractual obligations for the conduct of clinical studies 
costs are incurred primarily at the time of enrollment and paid under the terms of the contracts 
research and development expenses could vary significantly with changes in the timing of clinical activity 
stock options 
prior to april   we adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which disclosures are presented in note summary of significant accounting policies and related data in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because of this election  we accounted for our employee stock based compensation plans under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and the related interpretations 
we adopted sfas r on april  using the black scholes option pricing model and the modified prospective method  which requires the compensation cost to be recognized under sfas r for grants issued after the adoption date and the unvested portion of grants issued prior to the adoption date 
as a result of the adoption of 
table of contents sfas r  we recognized non cash share based compensation expense of approximately million during fiscal including the impact associated with the resignation of certain former officers and employees and we anticipate recognizing approximately million in non cash compensation expense during fiscal this estimate is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between financial accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
such differences relate primarily to the deductibility of certain accruals and reserves and the effect of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards not yet utilized 
deferred tax assets are evaluated for realization based on a more likely than not criterion in determining if a valuation allowance should be provided 
results of operations net sales us net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to higher average selling prices 
international net sales increased by million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  due to a increase in new patient sales and a higher average selling price

cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  third party contractor costs  royalties and the acquisition cost of raw materials and components 
gross margins can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based upon the mix between us and international sales  direct and distributor sales  the vns therapy system selling price  applicable royalty rates and the levels of production volume 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses 
sg a expenses are comprised of sales  marketing  development  general and administrative activities 
sg a expenses for the fiscal year decreased by million  or  as compared to fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a decrease of million in sales  marketing and related expenses associated with the trd launch during fiscal year  which was partially offset by higher finance and administration expenses of million primarily associated with the resignations of our chief executive officer ceo and our chief financial officer cfo  proxy cost of approximately million associated with a director election contest  an increase of million in legal and other expenses primarily due to costs associated with the investigation into our stock options granting and accounting practices  and an increase in non cash charges of million applicable to our adoption of sfas r

r d expenses decreased by million  or  as compared to fiscal year and increased by million  or  in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year the decrease in fiscal year is primarily due to a reduction in engineering and regulatory expenses of million  partially offset by an increase of million in international clinical expenses and million in higher non cash charges 
the increases during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year were primarily due to additional product development programs and expanded regulatory activities primarily related to the depression approval and launch

interest income interest income of million during fiscal year increased by as compared to interest income of million for fiscal year  due to increased interest rates 
interest income for fiscal year increased by as compared to fiscal year due to higher average investment balances attributable to the net proceeds of million received from the convertible notes and higher interest rates

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview we generated a net loss of million for the year ended april   as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended april  and net loss of million for the year ended april  the decrease in net loss during fiscal year as compared to the loss during fiscal is primarily due to decreases in sg a expenses in the amount of million as a result of lower sales  marketing and related expenses associated with the trd launch  and million reduction in clinical  engineering and regulatory expenses  partially offset by million in higher non cash charges  million associated with the resignation of the ceo and cfo  million contested proxy cost and million in legal and other expenses related to the sec investigation 
as a result  cash used in operations was million for the year ended april   as compared to million used in operations for the year ended april  and million used in operations for the year ended april  to fund operations  we incurred million in additional indebtedness in fiscal through additional borrowings against our line of credit facility 
we believe our current financial and capital resources will be adequate to fund anticipated business activities through fiscal  although there can be no assurance of this as this estimate is based upon a number of assumptions  which may not hold true 
our current assumptions include  consistent with the federal district court s june decision  the assumption that no default has occurred under the indenture for our convertible notes  which include principal maturity of greater than months 
the trustee has not appealed the district court s decision  however  if the trustee appeals the district court s decision  and if the court of appeals reverses the district court s decision  then all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes will be due and payable immediately  and we may not be able to maintain our operations as a going concern 
our projections of the future trd markets for vns therapy will be significantly impacted by the timing and outcome of pending reimbursement decisions for depression by major payers 
furthermore  our liquidity could be adversely affected by the factors affecting future operating results that are discussed in item a

on january   we established a million revolving line of credit that replaced the million revolving line of credit that expired in september borrowings against the line of credit were reduced by approximately million to million in fiscal on september   we issued convertible notes in the amount of million 
interest on the convertible notes at the rate of per year on the principal amount is payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year  beginning march  holders may convert their convertible notes  which were issued in the form of  bonds  into shares of our common stock per bond  which equal to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  at any time prior to maturity 
this offering provided net proceeds of approximately million 
we used the proceeds for a simultaneous share buyback of  shares at for a total of million and the net cost of million of separate convertible bond hedge and common stock warrant transactions  which transactions were designed to limit our exposure to potential dilution from conversion of the convertible notes 
these transactions resulted in net cash proceeds of million

we received approximately million in connection with the issuance of shares pursuant to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans in fiscal year borrowings against the line of credit were reduced by approximately million to million 
debt instruments and related covenants line of credit on january   we established a million revolving line of credit credit agreement with merrill lynch capital  a division of merrill lynch business financial services inc administrative agent and the lenders who are party thereto lenders 
the credit facility has a three year term ending january  and is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory  subsidiary stock  general intangibles  equipment and other collateral 
the collateral does not include our intellectual property and provides the lender only limited rights and remedies with respect to the funds raised in our convertible notes offering 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  we agreed to maintain a minimum liquidity  which is defined as the sum of the revolving loan limit minus the revolving loan outstanding plus the unrestricted cash and cash equivalent balances of million  and to provide periodic certifications of compliance in connection with the facility 
the amount available under the facility is limited to of the eligible accounts receivable and a portion of eligible inventory 
as of april  our available borrowing capacity was approximately million with a loan balance of million 
on december   we entered into a consent and amendment agreement with the administrative agent and lenders which provided that our receipt of the notice of default from the trustee in connection with the indenture as a result of our failure to file and deliver our form k as purportedly required by the indenture will not constitute a default under the credit agreement so long as there is no determination by a court and we have not otherwise acknowledged that a default has occurred under the indenture 
the consent and amendment agreement with the administrative agent and lenders further provided that for the term of the consent and amendment agreement our borrowing under the line of credit is limited to million 
on february  the terms of the credit agreement required that we begin paying interest on the minimum loan balance of million

interest on the convertible notes at the rate of per year on the principal amount is payable semi annually in arrears in cash on march and september of each year  beginning march  the convertible notes are unsecured and subordinated to all of our existing and future senior debt and equal in right of payment with our existing and future senior subordinated debt 
holders may convert their convertible notes  which were issued in the form of  bonds  into shares of our common stock per bond  which equal to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustments  at any time prior to maturity

as such  although the convertible notes mature in  we have included them as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheets as of april  and april  on june   a federal district court granted summary judgment to cyberonics and declared that no default occurred under the indenture 
in its court filings  the trustee stated that it was seeking approximately million in damages plus interest and attorney fees  but it reserved the right to seek immediate payment of full value of the convertible notes 
see note litigation indenture default litigation 
the trustee has not appealed the district court s decision 
if the trustee appeals the decision of the district court  and if the court of appeals reverses the decision of the district court and determines that a default occurred under the indenture  then all unpaid principal and accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes could be due and payable immediately unless we negotiate an amendment to the terms of the indenture 
if the principal and accrued interest on the outstanding convertible notes must be repaid immediately  we may not have or be able to obtain access to the funds needed to repay the indebtedness  and we may be forced to seek protection under the bankruptcy code 
if principal and interest on our indebtedness must be repaid immediately  we do not have the cash resources available to repay the debt

factors affecting future operating results and common stock price the factors affecting our future operating results and common stock prices are disclosed in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to limited market risk on interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments in commercial paper  auction rate securities and our line of credit 
we do not hedge interest rate exposure or invest in derivative securities 
based upon the average outstanding balances in cash  cash equivalents and our line of credit  a basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial results 
due to the global reach of our business  we are also exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly with the us dollar over the euro 
our wholly owned foreign subsidiary is consolidated into our financial results and is subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at this time  we have not deemed it to be cost effective to engage in a program of hedging the effect of foreign currency fluctuations on our operating results using derivative financial instruments 
a sensitivity analysis indicates that  if the us dollar uniformly weakened against the euro  the effect upon the net loss recorded during fiscal year would be favorable by approximately million  or 
conversely  if the us dollar uniformly strengthened against the euro  the impact on our operations would be unfavorable by approximately million  or 
our convertible notes are sensitive to fluctuations in the price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible 
changes in equity prices may result in changes in the fair value of the convertible subordinated debt due to the difference between the current market price of the debt and the market price at the date of issuance of the debt 
at april   a decrease in the price of our common stock could have resulted in a decrease of approximately million on the net fair value of our convertible notes  while a increase in the price of our common stock could have resulted in an increase of approximately million on the fair value of our convertible notes
