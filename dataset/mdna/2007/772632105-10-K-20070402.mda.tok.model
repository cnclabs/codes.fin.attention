item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  contained elsewhere in this document 
general rock of ages is an integrated quarrier  manufacturer  distributor and retailer of granite and products manufactured from granite 
during  we had three business segments quarry  manufacturing and retail 
the quarry division sells granite blocks to the manufacturing division and to outside manufacturers  as well as to customers outside north america 
the manufacturing division s principal product is granite memorials and mausoleums used primarily in cemeteries  although it also manufactures some specialized granite products for industrial applications 
the retail division primarily sells granite memorials directly to consumers 
in  our quarry group had its second consecutive difficult year 
divisional operating income of million was down from  and was the lowest divisional operating income in years 
the impact of lower revenues and gross margins was partly offset by lower selling  general and administrative expenses 
while demand for our granites in the export market improved from the sharp decline of  we encountered production and recovery challenges and were unable to meet demand for certain of our granites 
the largest decline occurred in our bethel white quarry  our most popular export product 
in bethel  lower recoveries and the need to begin quarrying a new level caused insufficient production of grade a blocks to meet demand 
salisbury pink and gardenia white quarries in north carolina  also popular with our overseas customers  saw improved shipments in both of theses quarries posted negative gross margins  however  due to lower production and lower recoveries 
our pennsylvania black quarry struggled with recovery challenges and as a result  shipments and margins were down 
in our barre gray quarry  the margin increased due to higher productivity  but sales were down from levels 
results from our canadian quarries were up slightly from in december  we sold the kershaw quarries for  recording a gain of  we did not actively operate this quarry during  and accordingly operating results were negligible 
we report kershaw as a discontinued operation in our consolidated statements of operations 
shipments and gross margin were down slightly in our galactic blue quarry in ukraine 
we continue to aggressively market our products in the us and abroad and to make productivity improvements and control costs to adjust to market conditions 
we believe that the productivity challenges we encountered in have been addressed as we move into the manufacturing division had a strong year in divisional operating income increased to million 
lower gross margins were more than offset by slightly higher revenue and significantly lower sg a 
monumental shipments for both traditional monuments and mausoleums were about the same in as demand for these projects remains strong and orders and shipments of the lower end memorials generally sold by our authorized retailers is steady 
industrial products shipments declined in although the gross margin for industrial products is higher than our overall margin  the margin for industrial products declined in late in we determined that increasing our sg a expenses in an effort to grow the business with our authorized retailer base a strategy we adopted late in was not effective 
we therefore took steps to reduce sg a in line with sales 
this action did not affect our commitment to market our higher end products 
we will continue to pursue a strategy of focusing on the mausoleum and large features market where our product is superior and margins are generally higher 
despite posting a net operating loss for  the retail segment delivered significantly improved results from the million operating loss includes million of restructuring charges and compares favorably with the million loss posted in revenue was down in compared with the decline was on a same store basis 
the gross margin  at in  improved slightly from through training and incentives  we continue to stress with our sales force the importance of developing strong referral sources through outreach programs with funeral homes and cemeteries  and of selling a higher mix of highly customized memorials 
our minimum gross margin target is 
in may  we announced a change in leadership for the retail division and recorded a restructuring charge of million associated with this action 
excluding this charge  retail sg a was lower in than as we continued to identify opportunities to improve our effectiveness through a combination of headcount reductions and related operational enhancements 
critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee and our independent auditor 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  and accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits 
revenue recognition quarry division the granite we quarry is sold both to outside customers and used by our manufacturing group 
our quarry division recognizes revenue from sales of granite blocks to outside customers when the granite is shipped and invoiced from the quarry  except for cases noted below 
we generally provide a discount for domestic customers if payment is made within days of purchase  except in the case of december terms described below 
sales to foreign customers are typically secured by a letter of credit 
at our barre  vermont quarries  we allow customers to purchase granite blocks and request that we store the blocks for them 
many of our customers do not have adequate storage space at their facilities and want to ensure an adequate supply of blocks  especially when the barre quarries are closed from mid december through mid march because of weather 
our quarry division recognizes revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
blocks are sold when the customer selects and identifies the block at the quarry site  requests the block be stored and they have significant business reasons to do so 
at that time  the block is removed from our inventory  the customer s name is printed on the block  and title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
the customer is invoiced and normal payment terms apply  except in the case of december terms described below 
granite blocks owned by customers remain on our property for varying periods of time after title passes to the buyer 
we retain a delivery obligation using our trucks 
however  we consider the earnings process substantially complete because the cost of delivery service is inconsequential less than in relation to the price 
further  under industry terms of trade  title passes and the payment obligation is established when the block is identified at the quarry 
each december  we offer special payment terms to our barre quarries customers 
as noted above  from approximately mid december to approximately mid march  our barre quarries are closed due to weather 
during this time  the quarry customers manufacturing plants remain open  and many prefer to ensure they own blocks of a size and quality selected by them prior to the quarries closure 
all blocks purchased in december are invoiced on or about december and  at that time  the blocks are removed from inventory  the customer s name is printed on the blocks  and title and risk of loss pass to the buyer 
payment terms are one third of the invoice amount on january  one third on february  and one third on march the program provides essentially the normal day payment terms during the months when the barre quarries are closed notwithstanding the customer purchases a three month supply in december and makes payments over days 
customers need not use these special december terms and may buy from inventory during the closure period on a first come  first served basis with the normal day payment terms 
manufacturing division we record revenue related to internally transferred granite only after the granite is manufactured into a finished product and sold to an outside customer 
manufacturing revenues related to outside customers are recorded when the finished product is shipped from our facilities or set in the cemetery  if we are responsible for the setting which is when the risk of ownership transfers  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues related to finished products transferred internally to our owned retail outlets are recorded as revenue by the retail division when ultimately sold to an outside customer 
retail division retail revenues are recorded when the finished monument is set in the cemetery  which is when risk of ownership transfers  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and collectibility is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  sfas no 

such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or change in utilization of property and equipment 
recoverability of the undepreciated cost of property and equipment is measured by comparison of the carrying amount to estimated future undiscounted net cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
those cash flows include an estimated terminal value based on a hypothetical sale at the end of the assets depreciation period 
estimating these cash flows and terminal values requires management to make judgments about the growth in demand for our products  sustainability of gross margins  and our ability to achieve economies of scale 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
valuation of deferred tax assets in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not some portion or all of the current and deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of current and deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
this assessment is made each reporting period 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company believed it was no longer more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax assets 
as such  we adjusted our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
at the end of and  we reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from its us operations in the future 
accounting for pensions and other post employment benefits we provide defined benefit pension and other post employment benefit plans for certain of our employees 
accounting for these plans requires the use of actuarial assumptions including estimates on the expected long term rate of return on assets  discount rates and  to a lesser extent  the rate of increase in health care costs due to the small number of individuals receiving this benefit 
the expected long term rate of return has remained the same at and reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
in we increased the discount rate used to determine our liability in the pension plans from to based on a bond matching model which uses data on individual high quality corporate bonds and the timing and amount of the future benefit payments in our plan to develop a weighted discount rate specific to our plan 
in order to make informed assumptions  we rely on outside actuarial experts as well as public market data and general economic information 
any changes in one or more of these assumptions may materially affect certain amounts reported on our balance sheet 
in particular  a decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets or a decrease in discount rate could result in an increase in our pension liability and a charge to equity as well as increases in pension expenses over time 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r  sfas no 

this statement requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
it also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements has been implemented as of december  the company recognized a reduction of  in prepaid pension costs and intangible assets  an increase of  in accrued pension and post retirement liabilities and a charge of  to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain historical statement of operations data as a percentage of net revenues with the exception of quarry  manufacturing and retail gross profit and sg a  which are shown as a percentage of their respective divisions revenues 
year ended december  statement of operations data net revenues quarry manufacturing retail total net revenues gross profit quarry manufacturing retail total gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative quarry manufacturing retail retail restructuring costs corporate overhead total sg a expenses impairment of note receivable foreign exchange loss adverse judgment and legal expenses total operating expenses loss from continuing operations before interest and income taxes gain on sale of investments interest expense loss from continuing operations before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of income taxes net loss the financial information for and has been reclassified to present the kershaw quarries as discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   revenue declined  gross profit declined and total selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for the year ended december  declined from shipments in were lower than in all quarries except salisbury and gardenia 
the salisbury pink and gardenia white granites are very popular for building purposes and we sell these granites primarily to international customers 
demand for our barre gray quarry  primarily used for memorials  continued to decline 
we believe that imported granites  which generally are less expensive  are being substituted in the lower end of the memorials market 
shipments of our bethel white granite were down in compared with demand for this granite remained strong  but production challenges limited our ability to quarry grade a product  so sales were down 
similarly  low recoveries  development work and lower productivity in our pennsylvania black quarry resulted in less product being available to ship 
finally  the galactic blue granite  which is quarried by our relatively new joint venture in the ukraine  continues to generate interest  however  production has been low as we continue to develop and open the quarry 
gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for the year ended december  declined and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points to from the decline in gross profit was primarily the result of the lower margin at our bethel quarry  which was largely offset by the improved margin at our barre quarry 
sg a expenses in our quarry segment for decreased from primarily due to lower salaries and benefits as the former president of this division retired in and the transition to new leadership was completed 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing group for the year ended december  increased from the increase was primarily a result of increased shipments from our memorials group which more than offset a decline in precision products sales 
gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group declined and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in gross profit margin resulted from the lower proportion of higher margin mausoleum and industrial products sales 
sg a expenses for the manufacturing group were down from the prior year primarily as a result of our decision late in to reduce our general sales staff 
our expenditures for mausoleum and industrial products sales efforts were not affected by these actions 
retail segment analysis revenues in our retail operations for the year ended december  were down from the prior year 
on a same store basis  revenues were down  or million 
sales momentum was stronger in the second half of  with same store sales up  or  from second half gross profit dollars for the retail operations in were down from the level 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue was  up from sg a expenses in retail in were down from the prior year  excluding restructuring costs of  the lower level of expenses for reflects the impact of staff reductions taken at the end of and into early  savings resulting from the restructuring  lower marketing costs  and generally tighter expense control 
these actions were taken to assure that our cost structure in retail is sized consistent with our revenue stream 
as previously announced  we made significant changes in the retail segment early in the second quarter of because of continuing sales declines and margin erosion  management concluded that it was unlikely that there would be significant growth in this division in the near term 
management further concluded that the cost of the infrastructure in the retail division was not sustainable at current revenue and profit levels 
accordingly  four senior positions were eliminated  a more streamlined management structure was put in place and a back to basics philosophy was adopted by the new retail division leadership 
annual savings from the position eliminations are expected to be approximately million 
improvement in revenue and margin  and additional cost reductions are also expected  but can not be quantified 
expenses associated with severance agreements and other restructuring charges amounted to  which is separately disclosed in our consolidated statements of operations 
the payment of these will occur over the twelve month period ending may and is being funded with cash from operations 
consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead declined  or  from the prior year 
in  we recognized an impairment of  on a long term note receivable which dated back to the sale of a manufacturing plant in elberton  georgia in foreign exchange loss in was  compared to  in resulting from the effect of the fluctuating value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
interest expense increased from million to million primarily as a result of higher borrowings  higher interest rates and higher spreads charged by our banks in compared to during  the total debt level rose by million  during it had increased million 
therefore  average borrowings during were higher than the interest rates paid on our credit facility are tied to libor and the prime rate  both of which increased during the spreads over the interest rate index charged by our banks were higher on average throughout as compared with because of the amendments to our credit arrangements caused by our not meeting certain debt covenants 
the income tax expense for was  compared with million for despite consolidated losses in both years 
the tax expense in reflects taxes at our canadian subsidiary 
at the end of the second quarter of  based on the level of taxable income and projections for future taxable income  the company determined it was no longer more likely than not that it would generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax asset 
this resulted in a charge to tax expense of million in the second quarter of this action did not affect the cash taxes paid by the company 
in each subsequent quarter since then  we have reached a similar conclusion  therefore we have continued to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax asset 
we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from the us operation in the future 
we had a gain from discontinued operations of  in as a result of the sale of the kershaw quarries 
this compares to a loss of  in from the kershaw operations 
in december  we sold the kershaw quarries for  recording a gain of  we had no other assets or operations held for sale as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  on a consolidated basis for all segments for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  revenue decreased  gross profit decreased and total sg a expenses increased for reasons discussed in detail in the segment analysis below 
quarry segment analysis revenues in our quarry operations for were million  down or million from this decline was primarily as a result of decreased shipments from our salisbury pink and gardenia white quarries to overseas customers 
shipments from these quarries were down million from levels 
our export shipments declined as a result of several factors  including our customers existing inventory levels as well as what we believe were credit restrictions imposed by the chinese central bank in an effort to slow construction spending 
shipments from our vermont and pennsylvania quarries were down approximately  from levels  despite an improvement in the pace of sales in the fourth quarter  particularly in the bethel  vermont quarry 
gross profit dollars from our quarry operations for decreased  and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased from of revenue for to of revenue for the decreases in gross profit dollars and gross profit as a percentage of revenue were largely a result of higher repair and maintenance expenses  absorption of additional expenses associated with the rockwell quarry acquisition in the second quarter of  write off of retired fixed assets in the pennsylvania quarry  lowered production due to mechanical failure of a derrick in our barre quarry and lower operational efficiencies associated with a decrease in revenue 
sg a expenses in our quarry segment decreased  or  in from levels 
manufacturing segment analysis revenues in our manufacturing operations for increased from primarily as a result of strong shipments of mausoleums as well as an increase in sales of industrial products 
at december   our backlog of mausoleum orders and typical memorial products was million   higher than the december  level 
gross profit dollars from the manufacturing group increased from the level and gross profit as a percentage of manufacturing revenue increased percentage points  to for the increase in gross profit margin is a result of the positive effect higher revenues have on reducing certain fixed costs as a percentage of revenue in our operations  as well as higher revenues from mausoleum and feature memorials which typically have above average gross margins 
manufacturing sg a expenses for increased compared with this was as a result of an increase to the management fee charged to our canadian manufacturing division by the us affiliate which is offset by lower corporate overhead  and the additional people and programs put in place to expand our sales to current authorized retailers and to add new authorized retailers 
we have concluded that this effort has not been effective and have taken steps to reduce the sg a expenses 
retail segment analysis revenues in our retail operations for increased from we believe the increase is a direct result of the initiatives undertaken in to improve our product mix  implement the branding strategy  develop a marketing plan and revamp the retail sales counselor compensation structure 
our order receipts in decreased compared with our backlog of approved and unapproved orders was million at december   down from million at december gross profit dollars from retail operations decreased from levels and gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased percentage points compared with we attribute these declines to errors in our assumptions about pricing and mix of craftsmanship levels when we established our new branding initiative and overhauled our pricing early in we raised and adjusted our pricing and targeted a return to the historical level of or higher gross margin percentage 
sg a expenses from our retail operations increased for compared to and sg a expenses as a percentage of retail revenue increased percentage points from the increase in sg a was a result of the expenses associated with the various investments in people and programs related to changing our product mix  branding strategy  marketing plan  retail sales counselor compensation structure  pricing policy  and other items 
while we continued to focus on the new branding and pricing programs introduced early in  during the second half of the year we developed a retail store staffing plan that  through a combination of headcount reductions and related operational enhancements  focuses on the productivity of our sales force and  we believe  will allow us to operate more efficiently with a smaller managerial staff 
we implemented the plan during the fourth quarter and by the end of the year we had made the associated staffing reductions and we had paid or accrued associated severance costs 
we expected this would reduce retail sg a expenses approximately to in as compared to consolidated items unallocated corporate overhead in was million essentially unchanged from in october  we sold our investment in ffs financial  recording a gain of  foreign exchange losses in were  compared to  in resulting from the effect of the fluctuating value of the us dollar compared to the canadian dollar on transactions that are originated in us dollars in our canadian operations 
interest expense increased from  in to million in as a result of an increase in the amount of debt outstanding during the year and higher interest rates on our credit facilities 
the higher debt levels were due to the operating losses sustained during  the rockwell quarry and the mccolly retail store acquisitions  and changes in working capital 
income tax expense for was million  compared with a benefit of  in in the second quarter of  the company made the determination that  based on the results of the previous three years coupled with current year actual and then projected operating results and the guidance in sfas  we could not estimate that the company will more likely than not generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of the net us deferred tax assets the company has generated over the years 
as such  we adjusted our valuation allowance against the net us deferred tax assets to fully reserve for the entire net us deferred tax assets 
after reviewing the results at the end of the year  we continued to fully reserve for the entire net deferred tax asset 
as required by sfas  we will continue to assess the valuation allowance on a regular basis and may reduce the valuation allowance if and or when the company has taxable income from its us operations in the future 
until or unless that occurs  we will show essentially no tax except for canadian tax expense in periods when we have earnings  until we generate the required taxable income to fully realize the benefit of our net us deferred tax assets 
these actions do not affect the cash taxes paid by the company 
the company s canadian subsidiary provided for income taxes payable in canada of  in compared to  in we had a gain from discontinued operations of  in as a result of reclassifying the results of operations of the autumn rose and kershaw quarries as discontinued 
this compares to a loss of  in from the kershaw operations 
in december  we sold the autumn rose quarry for  with no material gain or loss recognized 
liquidity and capital resources historically  we have met our short term liquidity requirements primarily from cash generated by operating activities and periodic borrowings under the commercial credit facilities described below 
our credit facility with our lenders expires in accordance with its terms on october  and  accordingly  the entire amount due under our credit facility is classified as a current liability as of december  we must enter into a new financing arrangement prior to the expiration of the current credit facility on october  to ensure that we will have adequate liquidity to meet our long term cash requirements 
we plan to begin discussions with our lenders on the renewal of the facility during the second quarter of see item a  risk factors and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in  the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan increased by approximately million primarily as a result of an increase in the discount rate used to calculate the pension benefit obligation from to  and higher actual returns on the plan assets in than in we have historically contributed between  and million per year to the plan and we contributed  in the company is not required to make any additional contributions in  however we expect to contribute  to the defined benefit plan during  which  we believe  we will be able to fund either from cash from operations or borrowing under our credit facilities 
see item a  risk factors and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our primary need for capital will be to maintain and improve our quarrying  manufacturing  and retail facilities 
we have approximately million budgeted for capital expenditures in cash flow at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and a working capital deficit of approximately million  compared to approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital at december  the decrease in working capital is mainly due to the classification of the entire amount due under our credit facility as a current liability 
cash from operations 
net cash used in operating activities was  in compared to million in the primary reason for the change is the lower net losses in  excluding the effect of the significant decrease in deferred tax assets coupled with the decrease in accounts receivable and other current assets and an increase in customer deposits 
along with other working capital changes  the net effect was net cash used in operations of a much smaller amount than the prior year 
net cash used in operating activities was million in compared to  in the primary reason for the change is the lower earnings in coupled with the non cash adjustments primarily from a decrease in customer deposits and pension liabilities as well as other working capital changes  which had the effect of decreasing cash from operations 
cash from investing activities 
cash flows provided by investing activities were  in compared to cash used in investing activities of million in in  proceeds from sale of retail operations in georgia and the kershaw quarries totaled million 
in our capital spending was million compared to million in in we acquired the rockwell quarry and the mccolly retail locations for million 
these were partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our ffs investment of million and retail operations in new jersey for  cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in in  our capital spending was million 
in addition  we used million in cash to make investments  primarily a million investment in ffs 
this cash used was partially offset by the receipt of million primarily from the payment of a note  which we had received in as partial consideration for the sale of our cemeteries 
cash used in investing activities generally comes from either borrowings under our credit facilities or from operations 
cash from financing activities 
financing activities provided million in which included million under our line of credit less million paid on our long term note 
this compares to million provided by financing activities in which included million under our line of credit and million on our long term debt  less million paid on the long term debt and  paid in dividends 
financing activities provided million in as a result of increased borrowings under our line of credit  an increase in borrowing under our long term note as well as cash provided from employees exercising stock options 
this was partially offset by the payment of dividends 
credit facility we have a credit facility with the cit group business credit and chittenden trust company the lenders that is scheduled to expire in october and is secured by substantially all assets of the company located in the united states 
the facility consists of an acquisition term loan line of credit of up to million and a revolving credit facility of up to another million based on eligible accounts receivable  inventory and certain fixed assets 
pursuant to the further amendment defined below  the lenders have placed a reserve of million against availability under the revolving credit facility with the lenders retaining the right to over advance at their discretion 
amounts outstanding were  and  as of december  and  and  as of december   on the revolving credit facility and the term loan line of credit  respectively 
availability under the revolving credit facility was  including the million reserve and  including the million reserve as of december  and december   respectively 
the weighted average interest rate was  and on the revolving credit facility in  and  respectively 
the credit facility loan agreement places restrictions on our ability to  among other things  sell assets  participate in mergers  incur debt  pay dividends  make capital expenditures  repurchase stock and make investments or guarantees  without pre approval by the lenders 
the credit facility agreement also contains certain covenants for a minimum operating cash flow to debt service ratio the ratio and a limit on the total liabilities to net worth ratio of the company 
minimum operating cash flow to debt service ratio 
the facility requires the ratio of the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less taxes paid and capital expenditures  to the sum of interest and scheduled debt repayments be at least for any trailing twelve month period at the end of a quarter 
primarily as a result of significant eurimex arbitration expenses in and operating losses in  and  we have been in violation of this covenant and have received waivers and amendments of this covenant from the lenders  which adjust the required covenant levels through the remaining term of the facility 
in october  the lenders amended the amendment our credit facility and changed the method of calculating the ratio for the trailing four quarters by allowing the company to exclude the  retail restructuring charge taken in the second quarter of the company was in compliance with the ratio covenant  as calculated according to the amendment  at december  due to extremely adverse weather conditions in its various markets during the first quarter of  the company expects to be in violation of the ratio covenant in the first quarter of in anticipation of missing the ratio covenant and in advance of the end of the first quarter  the company has obtained a waiver of the violation of the ratio covenant for the first quarter from the lenders 
under the waiver  the ratio may be as low as to 
after the first quarter of  the company expects to be in compliance with all existing covenants through the remaining term of the credit facility 
total liabilities to net worth ratio 
our credit facility also requires that the ratio of our total liabilities to net worth the leverage ratio not exceed pursuant to the amendment described above  the calculation of the leverage ratio was changed by excluding from that calculation any change in tangible net worth up to a maximum of  directly resulting from the company s compliance with sfas no 
in relevant part  sfas no 
requires us to place on our books certain unrecognized and unfunded retirement liabilities as of december  as of december   we were in compliance with the leverage ratio covenant as amended  and we expect to be in compliance with this covenant throughout the remaining term of the credit facility 
interest rates 
we have a multi tiered interest rate structure on our outstanding debt with the lenders 
we can elect the interest rate structure under the credit facility based on the prime rate or libor for both the revolving credit facility and the term loan 
the incremental rate above or below prime and above libor is based on our funded debt to net worth ratio 
based on this ratio  our current rates are basis points higher than the lowest incremental rates currently available to us 
in addition  the incremental interest rates under our credit facility were increased by a total of basis points during in connection with the amendments noted above 
because the company was in compliance with the terms of the amendments noted above  effective july  our rates were reduced by basis points 
however  in conjunction with the amendment the rates were increased by basis points effective october  the rates in effect as of december  were as follows amount outstanding formula effective rate revolving credit facility million prime pts 
revolving credit facility million libor pts 
term loan a million libor pts 
term loan b million libor pts 
term loan at prime 
million prime pts 
canadian credit facility the company s canadian subsidiary has a line of credit agreement with the royal bank of canada that is renewable annually 
under the terms of this agreement  a maximum of million cdn may be advanced based on eligible accounts receivable  eligible inventory  and tangible fixed assets 
the line of credit bears interest at the us prime rate 
there were no amounts outstanding as of december  and contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total obligations long term debt consists of various notes payable for general business use and acquisitions and estimated interest thereon  including the acquisition term loan line of credit portion of our credit facility 
excluding the obligation associated with the acquisition term loan line of credit portion of our credit facility  the remaining long term debt obligations will be funded from cash flow from operations 
the company expects to begin negotiating with its lenders a renewal of the entire credit facility including the obligation associated with the acquisition term loan line of credit during the second quarter of obligations of million under our revolving credit facility at december  are not included in this table 
operating leases are principally for real estate and vehicles and will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our credit facilities 
the purchase obligation consists of a supply agreement with adams granite co 
the company agreed to purchase a minimum of  of monuments from adams granite each year for a term of seven years with various stipulations as to variations from the minimum order and pricing agreements 
this obligation will be funded from a combination of cash flow from operations and our credit facilities 
we were not in compliance with the agreement for purchases 
the failure to meet the minimum order requirement was waived and the shortfall of  was added to the minimum order obligation for the agreement was entered into on january  and the remaining term is two years 
in addition to the contractual obligations included in the table  we have obligations to fund pension  salary continuation and other post employment benefit plans 
the actual commitments are contingent on certain factors that are uncertain or unknown at this time 
therefore  these obligations are not included in the table 
off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of our operating leases  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  and we do not have  nor do we engage in  transactions with any special purpose entities 
seasonality historically  the company s operations have experienced certain seasonal patterns 
generally  our net sales have been highest in the second or third quarter and lowest in the first quarter of each year due primarily to weather
