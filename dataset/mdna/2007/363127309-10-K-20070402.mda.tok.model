table of contents net operating loss carryforwards as a result of losses in prior years  as of december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes aggregating million 
these net operating loss carryforwards of million  million  million and million  if not utilized  will expire in   and  respectively 
as of december   the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards is approximately million  which is calculated by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of against the net operating loss carryforwards of million 
the company currently has a partial valuation allowance for its net operating loss carryforwards of  based on management s analysis of available evidence  both objective and subjective 
in certain circumstances  section of the internal revenue code may apply to materially limit the amount of our taxable income in a tax year that may be offset by our net operating losses carried forward from prior years the limitation 
the annual section limitation generally is an amount equal to the value of the company immediately before an ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate for the month in which the change occurs eg  if the ownership change occurred in december 
this annual limitation would apply to all years to which the net operating losses can be carried forward 
in general  the application of section occurs when the aggregate stock ownership percentage determined on the basis of value of shareholders has increased by more than percentage points over such shareholders lowest ownership percentages within a testing period generally a three year period ending on the date in which a transaction gives rise to a testing date 
in general  a shareholder is a person who directly or indirectly owns or more of the total value of the instruments that constitute stock for section purposes 
the term shareholder also refers to a group of shareholders that individually own less than of the total value of the outstanding stock and are referred to as a public group 
if a shareholder is an entity ie  a corporation  partnership or trust  then the corporation who has the nol carryforward referred to as a loss corporation is required to look through the entity and through any higher tier entity in order to determine which owners of the entity are indirectly shareholders 
it is the ownership of these ultimate shareholders  including public groups  that is considered when determining whether a greater than percentage point increase has occurred 
a testing date generally occurs whenever the percentage stock ownership by value of any shareholder changes 
thus  a disproportionate issuance of stock to existing shareholders or to new investors would give rise to a testing date  as would the transfer by an existing shareholder of some or all of its stock to a third party or an existing shareholder 
we believe that the transactions described above did not cause a greater than percentage point ownership shift  thus section did not apply and impose a limitation on our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
however  the transactions described above did result in a substantial ownership shift 
future transactions in our capital stock by us or others could affect our ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards 
rating am best is the principal rating agency of the insurance industry 
an insurance company s ability to effectively compete in the market place is in part dependent upon the rating determination of am best 
am best provides ratings of insurance companies based on comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations and expresses its rating as an opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
in november  am best affirmed the pooled rating assignment of our insurance subsidiaries of b fair with a stable outlook 
am best s assigns a b rating to companies that have  in the opinion of am best  a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders  but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions 
a b rating is the seventh out of the possible ratings 

table of contents government regulation our insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by insurance departments of the jurisdictions in which they are domiciled or licensed to transact business 
the nature and extent of such regulation and supervision varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
generally  an insurance company is subject to a higher degree of regulation and supervision in its state of domicile 
state insurance departments have broad administrative power relating to licensing insurers and agents  regulating premium charges and policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  prescribing statutory accounting methods and the form and content of statutory financial reports  and regulating the type and amount of investments permitted 
rate regulation varies from file and use to prior approval to mandated rates 
insurance departments are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that insurance companies maintain adequate capital and surplus and comply with a variety of operational standards 
insurance companies are generally required to file detailed annual and other reports with the insurance department of each jurisdiction in which they conduct business 
insurance departments are authorized to make periodic and other examinations of regulated insurers financial condition and operations to monitor financial stability of the insurers and to ensure adherence to statutory accounting principles and compliance with state insurance laws and regulations 
insurance holding company laws enacted in many jurisdictions grant to insurance authorities the power to regulate acquisitions of insurers and certain other transactions and to require periodic disclosure of certain information 
these laws impose prior approval requirements for certain transactions between regulated insurers and their affiliates and generally regulate dividend and other distributions  including management fees  loans  and cash advances  between regulated insurers and their affiliates 
under state insolvency and guaranty laws  regulated insurers can be assessed or required to contribute to state guaranty funds to cover policyholder losses resulting from the insolvency of other insurers 
insurers are also required by many states  as a condition of doing business in the state  to provide coverage to certain risks which are not insurable in the voluntary market 
these assigned risk plans generally specify the types of insurance and the level of coverage which must be offered to such involuntary risks  as well as the allowable premium 
many states also have involuntary market plans which hire a limited number of servicing carriers to provide insurance to involuntary risks 
these plans  through assessments  pass underwriting and administrative expenses on to insurers that write voluntary coverages in those states 
insurance companies are generally required by insurance regulators to maintain sufficient surplus to support their writings 
although the ratio of writings to surplus that the regulators will allow is a function of a number of factors  including the type of business being written  the adequacy of the insurer s reserves  the quality of the insurer s assets and the identity of the regulator  the annual net premiums that an insurer may write are generally limited in relation to the insurer s total policyholders surplus 
thus  the amount of an insurer s surplus may  in certain cases  limit its ability to grow its business 
the national association of insurance commissioners the naic also has developed a risk based capital rbc program to enable regulators to carry out appropriate and timely regulatory actions relating to insurers that show signs of weak or deteriorating financial condition 
the rbc program consists of a series of dynamic surplus related formulas which contain a variety of factors that are applied to financial balances based on a degree of certain risks  such as asset  credit and underwriting risks 
many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer s ability to exit a market 
for example  certain states limit an auto insurer s ability to cancel or non renew policies 
furthermore  certain states prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more lines of business from the state  except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department 
the state insurance department may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
laws and regulations that limit cancellation or non renewal of policies and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer s ability to exit unprofitable markets 

table of contents regulation of insurance constantly changes as real or perceived issues and developments arise 
some changes may be due to economic developments  such as changes in investment laws made to recognize new investment vehicles  other changes result from such general pressures as consumer resistance to price increases and concerns relating to insurer rating and underwriting practices and solvency 
in recent years  legislation and voter initiatives have been introduced  and in some areas adopted  which deal with use of non public consumer information  use of financial responsibility and credit information in underwriting  insurance rate development  rate determination and the ability of insurers to cancel or non renew insurance policies  reflecting concerns about consumer privacy  coverage  availability  prices and alleged discriminatory pricing 
in addition  from time to time  the us congress and certain federal agencies investigate the current condition of the insurance industry to determine whether federal regulation is necessary 
in some states  the auto insurance industry has been under pressure in past years from regulators  legislators or special interest groups to reduce  freeze  or set rates to or at a level that are not necessarily related to underlying costs  including initiatives to roll back auto and other personal lines rates 
this kind of activity has affected adversely  and in the future may affect adversely  the profitability and growth of the auto insurance business in those jurisdictions  and may limit the ability to increase rates to compensate for increases in costs 
adverse legislative and regulatory activity limiting the ability to price auto insurance adequately  or affecting the insurance operations adversely in other ways  may occur in the future 
the impact of these regulatory changes on us cannot be predicted 
employees as of december   we employed persons  of whom were officers  and were staff and administrative personnel 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents item a 
risk factors readers of this annual report on form k should consider the risk factors described in the following paragraphs in conjunction with the other information included herein 
see also forward looking statements appearing in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we face intense competition from other personal automobile insurance providers 
the nonstandard personal automobile insurance business is highly competitive and  except for regulatory considerations  there are relatively few barriers to entry 
we compete with both large national insurance providers and smaller regional companies 
the largest automobile insurance companies include the progressive corporation  the allstate corporation  state farm mutual automobile insurance company  geico  farmers insurance group  safeco corp  nationwide group and american international group 
our chief competitors include some of these companies as well as mercury general corporation  infinity property casualty corporation  bristol west holdings  inc  affirmative insurance holdings  inc  united automobile insurance group  sentry insurance group and direct general corporation 
some of our competitors spend substantially more on advertising  have more capital  higher ratings and greater resources than we have  may offer a broader range of products  lower prices and down payments than we offer  and may pay higher commissions to agents and offer superior customer service 
some of our competitors that sell insurance policies directly to customers  rather than through agencies or brokerages as we do  may have certain competitive advantages  including increased name recognition among customers  direct relationships with policyholders and potentially lower cost structures 
in addition  it is possible that new competitors will enter the nonstandard automobile insurance market 
our loss of business to competitors could have a material impact on our growth and profitability 
further  competition could result in lower premium rates and less favorable policy terms and conditions including policy claim limits  which could reduce our underwriting margins 
we do not use credit scores in underwriting  unlike many of our competitors  which may result in additional risks in our business 
the property and casualty insurance industry has historically been characterized by cyclical periods of intense price competition due to excess underwriting capacity  as well as periods of shortages of underwriting capacity that allow for attractive premiums and attract additional competitors 
the periods of intense price competition may adversely affect our operating results  and the overall cyclicality of the industry may cause fluctuations in our operating results and affect our ability to manage the business profitably 
our failure to pay claims accurately could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we must accurately evaluate and pay claims that are made under our policies 
many factors affect our ability to pay claims accurately  including but not limited to the training and experience of our claims representatives  our claims organization s culture and the effectiveness of our management  our ability to develop or select and implement appropriate procedures and systems to support our claims functions and other factors 
our failure to pay claims accurately could lead to material litigation  undermine our reputation in the marketplace  impair our image and materially adverse affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  if we do not train new claims employees effectively or lose a significant number of experienced claims employees our claims department s ability to handle an increasing workload could be adversely affected 
in addition to potentially requiring that growth be slowed in the affected markets  we could suffer in decreased quality of claims work  which in turn could lower our operating margins 
we have recently made significant operational changes in management of our claims administration to accelerate the recognition and resolution of claims 
these changes may result in an increase in the amount of aggregate claim settlements and cause our ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense to increase in comparison to prior periods 

table of contents we rely on information technology and telecommunication systems  and the failure of these systems could materially and adversely affect our business 
our business is highly dependent upon the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems 
we rely on these systems to process new and renewal business  provide customer service  make claims payments and facilitate billings  collections and cancellations 
these systems also enable us to perform actuarial and other modeling functions necessary for underwriting and rate development 
the failure of these systems could interrupt our operations or materially impact our ability to evaluate and write new business 
because our information technology and telecommunication systems interface with and depend on third party systems  we could experience service denials if demand for such service exceeds capacity or such third party systems fail or experience interruptions 
if sustained or repeated  a system failure or service denial could result in a deterioration of our ability to write and process new and renewal business and provide customer service or compromise our ability to pay claims in a timely manner 
this outcome could result in a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our profitability and financial condition are affected by the availability of reinsurance 
we utilize catastrophe reinsurance to transfer or cede a portion of the risks related to our nonstandard automobile insurance business through reinsurance arrangements with third parties 
the amount  availability and cost of reinsurance are subject to prevailing market conditions that are beyond our control 
these conditions affect our level of business and profitability 
we have used reinsurance to dispose of certain of our discontinued and runoff businesses 
although reinsurance makes the reinsurer liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred  it does not relieve us of our liability to our policyholders 
at december   we had approximately million in reinsurance receivables  comprised primarily of reserves for future claim payments 
approximately of these receivables were concentrated with reinsurers  all of which were companies rated a or better by am best 
one company with a b rating owed approximately of the reinsurance receivables and one company with a c rating owed approximately of the reinsurance receivables 
five companies with a nr am best rating owed approximately of the reinsurance receivables 
the failure of reinsurers to pay amounts due to us on a timely basis or at all would adversely affect our results of operations 
reinsurance makes the assuming reinsurer liable to the extent of the risks ceded 
we are subject to credit risks with respect to the reinsurers because ceding risks to reinsurers does not relieve our insurance subsidiaries ultimate liability to their insureds 
the insolvency of any reinsurer or the inability of a reinsurer to make payments could have a material adverse effect on our business  our results of operations and our financial condition 
our business is subject to financial and operational risks resulting from our growth 
we limited our business to florida until the fourth quarter of  when we began writing nonstandard personal automobile insurance policies in texas 
in  we began writing nonstandard personal automobile insurance policies in arizona and nevada and in initiated a california program with an independent managing general agency 
we entered the south carolina market in and the new mexico market in significant growth has been realized as a result of these expansion activities  which has increased our operating leverage  claims ratio and the overall financial and operating risk profile 
our current plan is to continue growing in those states and possibly enter additional states in the future 

table of contents our growth strategy necessarily entails increased financial and operational risks and other challenges that are greater than and different from those to which we have previously been subject in writing nonstandard personal automobile insurance 
these risks and challenges include  but are not limited to  the following competitive conditions for our product have intensified recently  and further pressures on pricing are anticipated  generally  new business initially produces higher claim ratios than more seasoned in force business  and this factor is likely to be magnified to the extent that we enter multiple new states and market areas within a short period of time 
furthermore  it amplifies the importance of our ability to assess any new trends accurately and respond effectively  pricing decisions in new states and markets  involving different claims environments  distribution sources and customer demographics  will be made without the same level of experience and data that is available in existing markets  our expected growth will require additional personnel resources  including management and technical underwriting  claims and servicing personnel  relationships with agents and vendors with whom we have not previously done business  and additional dependence on operating systems and technology  and if we grow significantly or if adverse underwriting results occur  additional capital may be required  and such capital may not be available on favorable or acceptable terms 
our ability to maintain sufficient capital and perform successfully will be important factors in determinations of our am best rating  and a reduction in that rating could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
our ability to manage these risks and challenges will determine in large part whether we can continue to operate profitably 
a downgrade in our financial strength ratings may negatively affect our business 
financial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and may be expected to have an effect on an insurance company s sales 
an insurance company s ability to effectively compete in the marketplace is in part dependent upon the rating determination of am best  the principal rating agency of the insurance industry 
am best provides ratings of insurance companies based on comprehensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations and expresses its rating as an opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
in november  the am best rating affirmed the pooled rating assignment of our insurance subsidiaries of b fair with a stable outlook 
am best assigns b and b ratings to companies that have  in the opinion of am best  a fair ability to meet their current obligations to policyholders  but are financially vulnerable to adverse changes in underwriting and economic conditions 
if we do not successfully implement our business plan  if the risks we describe materially and adversely affect our results or financial position or if our written premiums exceed levels deemed prudent by am best  we would face the risk of a downgrade by am best 
a downgrade in our rating may cause our independent agents to limit or stop their marketing of our products and may limit that availability and materially and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and the terms of capital to us 
our success depends on our ability to underwrite risks accurately and to charge adequate rates to policyholders 
our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations depend on our ability to underwrite and set rates accurately for the risks we underwrite 
rate adequacy is necessary to generate sufficient premium to offset claims  claim adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses and to earn a profit 

table of contents our ability to price accurately is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation the availability of sufficient reliable data  our ability to conduct a complete and accurate analysis of available data  our ability to recognize changes in trends in a timely manner and to project both the severity and frequency of losses with reasonable accuracy  uncertainties inherent in estimates and assumptions  generally  our ability to project changes in certain operating expenses with reasonable certainty  the development  selection and application of appropriate rating formulae or other pricing methodologies  our ability to innovate with new pricing strategies and marketing initiatives  and the success of those innovations  our ability to predict policyholder retention accurately  unanticipated court decisions  legislation or regulatory action  ongoing changes in our claim settlement practices  changing driving patterns  unexpected changes in the medical sector of the economy  unanticipated changes in automobile repair costs  automobile parts prices and used car prices  and timely approval of proposed rates by regulatory agencies 
such risks may result in our pricing being based on stale  inadequate or inaccurate data or inappropriate analyses  assumptions or methodologies  and may cause us to estimate incorrectly future changes in the frequency or severity of claims 
as a result  we could underprice risks  which would negatively affect our margins  or we could overprice risks  which could reduce our volume and competitiveness 
in either event  our operating results  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
insurance agents improper use of authority may materially affect our business 
as of december   we marketed our products and services through over  independent agency locations in arizona  florida  nevada  new mexico  south carolina and texas and one independent general agency in california that markets through approximately  independent agency locations 
these agents have the ability to bind us with respect to insurance coverage issued on our behalf 
since the agents are independent  we have only limited ability to exercise control over these agents 
in the event that an agent exceeds its authority by binding us on a risk that does not comply with our underwriting guidelines  we are at risk for that policy until we receive the application and effect a cancellation 
this may result in losses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to comprehensive laws and regulations  and our results may be unfavorably impacted by these laws and regulations 
we are subject to comprehensive laws and governmental regulation and supervision 
most insurance laws and regulations are designed to protect the interests of policyholders rather than the shareholders and other investors of the insurance companies 
these regulations  administered by the department of insurance in each state in which we do business  relate to  among other things establishing mandatory minimum policy limits and coverages  approval of policy forms  rates and rating methodologies  standards of solvency  including risk based capital measurements developed by the national association of insurance commissioners  or the naic  and used by state insurance regulators to identify inadequately capitalized insurance companies  licensing of insurers and their agents  restrictions on the nature  quality and concentration of investments  restrictions on the ability of insurance company subsidiaries to pay dividends  restrictions on transactions between the insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates  requiring certain methods of accounting  periodic examinations of operations and finances  prescribing the form and content of records of financial condition to be filed  requiring reserves for unearned premium  claims and other purposes  sales plans and practices and commission structures  permitted advertising  and market conduct 
state insurance departments also conduct periodic examinations of the affairs of insurance companies and require filing of annual and other reports relating to the financial condition of insurance companies  holding company issues and other matters 
insurance regulations and regulators have an impact on a number of factors that could affect our ability to respond to changes in our competitive environment and which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these factors include regulating our ability to exit a book of business or to exit a state in which we have been producing insurance  our ability to receive adequate premiums to achieve acceptable profitability levels  and the amount of statutory dividends from our subsidiaries which may be needed to pay expenses and dividends 
failure to maintain risk based capital at the required levels or ratios within the naic s usual range could adversely affect our insurance subsidiaries ability to secure regulatory approvals as necessary or appropriate and would materially adversely affect their general business  ability to operate and overall financial condition 

table of contents our business depends on compliance with applicable laws and regulations and our ability to maintain valid licenses and approvals for our operations 
regulatory authorities may deny or revoke licenses for various reasons  including violations of regulations 
changes in the level of regulation of the insurance industry or changes in laws or regulations themselves or interpretations by regulatory authorities  could have a material adverse affect on our operations 
state statutes limit the aggregate amount of dividends that our subsidiaries may pay us  thereby limiting our funds to pay expenses and dividends 
litigation may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as a property and casualty insurance company  we are subject to various claims and litigation seeking damages and penalties  based upon  among other things  payments for claims we have denied and other monetary damages 
in some cases  plaintiffs seek to recover damages far in excess of our policy limits based on assertions of bad faith in the manner in which we have handled particular claims 
some litigation against us could take the form of class action complaints by consumers 
as automobile insurance industry practices and regulatory  judicial and consumer conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge  such as a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting automobile insurers in purported class action litigation relating to claim handling practices and regulatory noncompliance 
these issues can have a negative effect on our business by either extending coverage beyond our underwriting intent or the way we are permitted to price products  limiting the factors we may consider when we underwrite risks  or by requiring us to change our claims handling procedures or our practices for charging fees  or by increasing the size of claims or resulting in other monetary damages 
the damages and penalties in these types of matters can be substantial 
the relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but may include requests for compensatory  statutory and punitive damages 
we and two of our subsidiaries are named as defendants in a purported class action pending in united states district court for the middle district of florida  ft 
myers division 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated certain provisions of florida insurance laws with respect to the manner in which finance charges are imposed on florida residents in connection with installment payments of insurance premiums 
the complaint seeks damages in an unspecified amount in excess of million and other relief 
the office of the new york attorney general and other state attorneys general are investigating certain insurance industry practices 
the new york attorney general has filed a lawsuit against marsh mclennan companies  inc and  in so doing  named various insurance companies who may have had involvement in the insurance industry practices in question 
the investigations appear to center around practices by which other insurance companies paid contingent compensation to insurance brokers based on the volume or profitability of the insurance placed with the insurance company for their clients  allegedly in violation of the brokers duty to act in the best interest of their clients rather than their own undisclosed pecuniary interest 
we were not named in this lawsuit  however  we may become involved at some point in the future 
the expenses and other effects of our potential involvement in this litigation on our business  financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted and may be material 
several of our competitors are named as defendants in a number of putative class action and other lawsuits challenging various aspects of their insurance business operations 
these lawsuits include cases alleging damages as a result of the use of after market parts  total loss evaluation methodology  the use of credit in underwriting and related requirements under the federal fair credit reporting act  the methods used for evaluating and paying certain bodily injury  personal injury protection and medical payment claims  methods of imposing finance charges on installment premiums  and policy implementation and renewal procedures  among other matters 
litigation may be filed against us and or our subsidiaries or disputes may arise in the future concerning these or other business practices 
from time to time  we also may be involved in such litigation or other disputes alleging that our business practices violate the patent  trademark or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
in addition  lawsuits have been filed  and other lawsuits may be filed in the future  against our competitors and other businesses  and although we are not a party to such litigation  the results of those cases may create additional risks for  and or impose additional costs and or limitations on  our subsidiaries business operations 

table of contents lawsuits against us often seek significant monetary damages 
moreover  as courts resolve individual or class action litigation in insurance or related fields  a new layer of court imposed regulation could emerge  resulting in material increases in our costs of doing business 
such litigation is inherently unpredictable 
except to the extent we have established reserves with respect to particular lawsuits that are currently pending against us  we are unable to predict the effect  if any  that these pending or future lawsuits may have on the business  operations  profitability or financial condition 
an adverse resolution of the litigation pending or threatened against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the nonstandard insurance business may become subject to adverse publicity  which may negatively impact our financial condition 
negative publicity arising from attention of consumer advocacy groups  the media or other sources may result in increased regulation and legislative scrutiny of industry practices as well as increased litigation  which could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our results of operations 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by competitive  regulatory or economic conditions that influence the automobile insurance industry in general 
driving patterns  inflation in the cost of automobile repairs and medical care  and increasing litigation of liability claims are some of the more important factors that affect claim trends 
we and other nonstandard automobile insurers are generally unable to increase premiums unless permitted by regulators  typically after the costs associated with the coverage have increased 
accordingly  profit margins generally decline in a period of increasing claim costs  and we may be unable to sustain our policies in force 
catastrophic losses could have a material  adverse effect on our business 
catastrophic losses could occur either as a result of insurance claims or because of interruption in our ability to conduct business efficiently 
property and casualty insurance companies are subject to claims arising from natural and man made catastrophes that may have a significant impact on their business  results of operations and financial condition 
catastrophic losses can be caused by a wide variety of events  including hurricanes  tropical storms  tornadoes  wind  hail  fires  riots  terrorism and explosions  and their incidence and severity are inherently unpredictable 
the extent of claims from a catastrophe is a function of two factors the total amount of an insurance company s exposure in the area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
our policyholders are currently concentrated in geographic areas that are periodically subject to adverse weather and other conditions 
accordingly  the occurrence of a catastrophe in the states in which we operate or in which we may operate in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
separately  a catastrophic interruption of our technology systems could disrupt our operations or prevent us from providing acceptable customer service or managing other aspects of our business effectively 

table of contents our claim and claim adjustment expense may exceed our claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  which could adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
our financial statements include claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for reported and unreported claims which represent our best estimate of what we will ultimately pay on claims and the related costs of adjusting those claims as of the date of our financial statements 
when available  we rely heavily on our historical claim and claim adjustment experience in determining these reserves 
we may not have historical results for new markets  or the historic development of reserves for claim and claim adjustment expense may not accurately reflect future trends 
for example  these estimates are subject to large potential errors because the ultimate disposition of claims incurred before the date of our financial statements  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred  such as jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes  subsequent damage to property  changes in the medical condition of claimants  public attitudes and economic conditions such as inflation  new classes of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in historical data are not yet identifiable  and our inability to predict future events 
our expansion into new markets and states increases the risk that our reserves do not accurately reflect the ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense that we will incur 
there may also be a significant reporting lag between the occurrence of an event and the time it is reported to us 
the inherent uncertainties of estimating our reserves are greater for certain types of liabilities  particularly those in which the various considerations affecting the type of claim are subject to change and in which long periods of time may elapse before a definitive determination of liability is made 
we have recently made significant operational changes in the claims adjustment process  and changing claims trends increase the uncertainties which exist in the estimation process and could lead to inaccurate estimates of claim and claim adjustment expense 
reserve estimates are refined as experience develops and claims are reported and settled 
adjustments to reserves are reflected in the results of the period in which such estimates are changed 
our independent actuary has indicated that there are significant risks and uncertainties that could result in material adverse deviation of our unpaid claim and claim adjustment expenses 
as a result of the factors discussed above  the amount of actual claim and claim adjustment expense that we pay to claimants may be substantially more than the reserves reflected in our financial statements 
our debt service obligations could impede our operations  flexibility and financial performance 
our level of debt could affect our financial performance 
as of december   we had consolidated indebtedness other than trade payables and certain other short term debt of approximately million and additional availability under our credit facility of million 
in addition  borrowings under our credit agreement and the capital securities issued gainsco capital trust i and gainsco statutory trust ii  which were organized by the company  bear interest at rates that fluctuate 
the capital trust and statutory trust are not consolidated with the company 
therefore  increases in interest rates on the obligations under our credit agreement and the capital securities would adversely affect our income and cash flow that would be available for the payment of interest and principal on the loans under our credit agreement 
our interest expense for the year ended december  was  
table of contents our level of debt could have important consequences  including the following we will need to use a portion of the money we earn to pay principal and interest on outstanding amounts due under our credit facility  which will reduce the amount of money available to us for financing our operations and other business activities  we may have a much higher level of debt than certain of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage  we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future  and we could be more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we continue to expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt from our operations 
our ability to meet our expenses and debt service obligations thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  demographic and other factors  including competition 
if we do not have enough money to pay our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity 
in that event  we may not be able to refinance our debt  sell assets  borrow more money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we are subject to restrictive debt covenants  which may restrict our operational flexibility 
our credit facility contains various operating covenants  including among other things  restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends on and redeem capital stock  make other restricted payments  including investments  sell our assets and enter into consolidations  mergers and transfers of all or substantially all of our assets 
these restrictions could limit our ability to take actions that require funds in excess of those available to us 
our credit facility also requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy financial condition tests 
our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that we will meet those ratios and tests 
a breach of any of these covenants  ratios  tests or restrictions could result in an event of default under the credit facility 
if an event of default exists under the credit facility  the lender could elect to declare all outstanding amounts immediately due and payable 
if the lender under our credit facility accelerates the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full that indebtedness and our other indebtedness that would become due as a result of such acceleration 
we may need to raise additional capital 
we may need additional capital to continue growing our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital 
if we are unable to obtain required capital on favorable terms  or at all  we may be forced to change our business plan and may be unable to respond to competitive pressures in our business 
even if we are able to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to the rights of existing investors 
in addition  if we raise capital through senior credit facilities  we would experience risks typically associated with credit borrowings  such as risks of defaults that we are unable to cure  enforcement of any liens or other security interests we may grant and restrictions on our operations  including those that might be required to comply with any financial and non financial covenants 
additional capital could also be dilutive to our common shareholders and result in significantly higher interest expense and indebtedness  thereby reducing the earnings available to common shareholders 

table of contents a change in immigration policies could adversely affect our growth 
we believe that a majority of our current and potential customers is hispanic  and a key element of our growth strategy involves our continued focus on marketing our nonstandard automobile insurance in this market niche 
an important element to this strategy is our belief that a growing percentage of potential customers for personal nonstandard automobile insurance are hispanic 
in recent years  there have been a variety of legislative proposals to limit immigration to the united states or make other policy changes that may be adverse to undocumented immigrants 
if one or more proposals were to be adopted and had the effect of curtailing such immigration or imposing additional requirements on immigrants requiring insurance  this could result in decline in growth of the hispanic market  which may have an adverse effect on our abilities to achieve our growth strategies and our ability to expand our business in the markets in which we currently operate and may operate in the future 
the performance of our portfolio of fixed income and equity securities may affect our profitability  capitalization and financial performance 
we maintain an investment portfolio that currently consists primarily of fixed income securities 
the quality  market value  yield and liquidity of the portfolio may be affected by a number of factors  including the general economic and business environment  changes in the credit quality of the issuer of the fixed income securities  changes in market conditions or disruptions in particular markets  changes in interest rates  or regulatory changes 
these securities are issued by both domestic and foreign entities and are backed either by collateral or the credit of the underlying issuer 
factors such as an economic downturn or political change in the country of the issuer  a regulatory change pertaining to the issuer s industry  deterioration in the cash flows or the quality of assets of the issuer  or a change in the issuer s marketplace may adversely affect our ability to collect principal and interest from the issuer 
both equity and fixed income securities have been affected over the past several years  and may be affected in the future  by significant external events 
examples of such events would include the september terrorist attacks  hurricanes  corporate accounting scandals and temporary or long term disruptions in markets 
credit rating downgrades  defaults  and impairments may result in write downs in the value of the fixed income securities held by the company 
as of december   we held million of fixed income securities  million of which were rated below bbb based on standard poor s credit ratings 
the investments our insurance company subsidiaries hold are highly regulated by specific legislation in oklahoma and texas that governs the type  amount  and credit quality of allowable investments  and the fixed income securities in which we invest are evaluated by the naic s security valuation office the svo 
legislative changes or changes in the svo s evaluations could force us to adjust investment carrying values  with a resulting adverse effect on the level of our statutory capital 
we may use derivative instruments that are hedging in nature in order to manage our interest rate and equity market risk 
although we take precautions to minimize our exposure  our profitability may be adversely affected if a counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults in its payment 
failure to successfully resolve our remaining commercial lines claims could have an adverse affect on our results of operations 
on february   we announced our decision to cease writing commercial insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
as a result  there are no commercial policies remaining in force at december  we continue to settle and reduce our inventory of commercial lines claims 
at december   there were claims associated with our runoff book outstanding  compared to at june  and at december  due to the long tail and litigious nature of these claims  we anticipate that it will take a substantial number of years to complete the adjustment and settlement process with regard to existing claims and the additional claims we expect to receive in the future from our past business writings 
most of the remaining claims are in litigation and our future results may be impacted negatively if we are unable to resolve the remaining claims and new anticipated claims within our established reserve level 

table of contents our success depends on retaining our current key personnel and attracting additional personnel 
our success will depend largely on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management  especially those of robert w 
stallings  our chairman of the board and chief strategic officer  glenn w 
anderson  our president  chief executive officer and director and james r 
reis  our executive vice president 
our business may be adversely affected if the services of these officers or any of our other key personnel become unavailable to us 
we have entered into employment agreements with messrs 
stallings  anderson and reis 
even with these employment agreements  there is a risk that these individuals will not continue to serve for any particular period of time 
we may hire additional key employees and officers to support our business growth  our focus on the nonstandard personal automobile insurance business  our expansion into new geographic markets and the improvement and enhancement of our systems and technologies 
hiring management personnel is very competitive in our industry due to the limited number of people available with the necessary skills  experience and understanding of our business procedures and the necessary leadership ability to guide us through the strategic development initiatives contemplated in the immediate years ahead 
in  we adopted a new long term focused system of performance based equity compensation for key personnel 
pursuant to such plan  the compensation committee  all of whose members are independent  is authorized to offer performance based incentive grants and potentially issue up to of our outstanding common stock over time based on achievement of performance targets 
in  the compensation committee approved grants of up to  restricted stock units which may be earned by the achievement of specified performance criteria during the period from to our inability to attract  train or retain the number of highly qualified personnel that our business needs may cause our business and prospects to suffer 
we cannot be certain that the net operating loss tax carryforwards will continue to be available to offset our tax liability 
as of december   we had net operating loss tax carryforwards for federal income tax purposes  which we refer to as nols  of approximately  in order to utilize the nols  we must generate taxable income which can offset such carryforwards 
the nols will expire if not used 
the availability of nols to offset taxable income would be substantially reduced if we were to undergo an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code 
we will be treated as having had an ownership change if there is more than a change in stock ownership during a three year testing period by shareholders 
the nols will expire in various amounts  if not used  between and we cannot assure you that we would prevail if the irs were to challenge the availability of the nols 
if the irs were successful in challenging our nols  all or some portion of the nols would not be available to offset any future consolidated income 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  and the volume of trading in our common stock is very low 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of insurance companies  including nonstandard automobile insurance companies  have been especially volatile 
such fluctuations can result from  among other things quarterly variations in operating results  changes in market valuations of other similar companies  announcements by us or our competitors of new products  contracts  acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  
table of contents additions or departures of key personnel  significant sales of common stock by insiders or others or the perception that such sales could occur  general economic trends and conditions  deterioration in the trading market for our common stock  and future issuances of stock or debt securities to fund our anticipated growth 
in addition  the stock market has periodically experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall and could negatively affect an investment in our common stock regardless of our performance 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock  including us  have been the object of securities class action litigation 
securities class action litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
certain of our executives and directors own a majority of our outstanding capital stock  and therefore exercise voting control over the company 
our executive officers and directors  together with our largest shareholder  beneficially own a majority of our outstanding common stock as of december   they potentially have the power to control the actions of the company with respect to items requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors  the adoption of amendments to our articles of incorporation and bylaws  and the approval of mergers or other significant corporate transactions 
their interests in approving such actions might not be aligned with the interests of other owners of our common stock

business operations overview the company is engaged in the property and casualty insurance business through its insurance company and managing general agency subsidiaries 
insurance operations include ongoing nonstandard personal auto insurance and the runoff of the commercial lines business  which was discontinued in the principal sources of revenues for the company are premiums on nonstandard personal auto insurance  net investment income from the company s investment portfolio and fee income from insurance agency operations 
the company s current vision is to grow the nonstandard personal auto business in target states to establish a broader and more geographically diversified earnings base 
significant growth at higher levels of operating leverage could enable the company to materially increase its profitability  if it is able to achieve that growth with favorable profit margins  but it also has the potential to cause material and adverse effects on our financial condition and results if not profitably managed 
the company limited its nonstandard personal auto insurance business to florida until the fourth quarter of  when it began writing policies in texas 
the company began writing policies in arizona and nevada in  in california  with an independent managing general agency  in  and in south carolina in  and we are entering new mexico in the first quarter of the company markets its policies through  independent agency locations in arizona  florida  nevada  new mexico  south carolina and texas and one general agency in california that markets through approximately  independent agency locations 
beginning in  significant growth has been realized as a result of these expansion activities  which has increased the operating leverage  the claims ratio and the overall financial and operational risk profile of the company 
the following table presents selected financial information in thousands of dollars years ended december  gross premiums written earned premiums net income before federal income taxes federal income tax benefit net income net income available to common shareholders gaap c cae ratio gaap expense ratio gaap combined ratio c cae is an abbreviation for claims and claims adjustment expenses  stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 
the expense and combined ratios do not reflect expenses of the holding company 
commissions  change in deferred acquisition costs  underwriting expenses and operating expenses insurance subsidiaries only are offset by agency revenues and are stated as a percentage of net premiums earned 

table of contents the company incurred substantial costs throughout and in amounts greater than in previous periods to build its nonstandard personal auto insurance operations 
these expenditures include but are not limited to hiring  relocation and incremental office space and wage and benefit costs  including costs for qualified additional personnel  furniture  fixtures  equipment  software and systems  additional marketing costs  such as agency compensation incentives  advertising and promotional expenses  including the daytona prototype series racing team sponsorship  increased audit fees  and financing costs and higher fees for services  and non cash expenses associated with the company s long term incentive compensation plan 
the company believes it is pursuing a strategy that has the potential to build a substantially larger  competitively distinctive and successful franchise in the nonstandard personal auto business over time and is endeavoring to manage its investments and risks to achieve this result 
these risks and other challenges  occurring in rapidly changing economic  competitive  regulatory and claims environments  are greater than and in some cases different from those to which the company has previously been subject in writing nonstandard personal auto insurance 
the company s operating and financial results vary from period to period as a result of numerous factors inherent in the insurance business  many of which are affected by such changes 
until  the company limited its growth due primarily to capital constraints 
however  capital restructuring transactions  along with key investments in operations  have permitted management to pursue a more aggressive  geographically diversified expansion plan beginning in in the first quarter of  the company issued million of year subordinated debentures  which enabled the company to redeem its outstanding series a preferred stock due in january  and provided additional capital of million 
in the fourth quarter of  the company issued million of year subordinated debentures  which the company intends to use the proceeds for general corporate purposes 
see capital transaction subordinated debentures 
discontinuance of commercial lines on february   the company announced its decision to cease writing commercial insurance due to continued adverse claims development and unprofitable results 
the discontinuance of writing commercial lines resulted in the company ceasing to be approved to write insurance in several states  however  this state action has not materially restricted the geographic expansion of the company s nonstandard personal auto lines thus far 
the company continues to settle and reduce its inventory of commercial lines claims 
at december   there were claims associated with the company s runoff book outstanding  compared to as of december  as of december   in respect of its runoff lines  the company had  in net unpaid claims and claims adjustment expenses c cae compared to  as of december  for the periods presented  the company has recorded favorable development in unpaid c cae from the runoff lines with the settlement and reduction in the inventory of commercial lines claims 
see results of operations claims and claims adjustment expenses 
due to the long tail and litigious nature of these claims  the company anticipates it will take a substantial number of years to complete the adjustment and settlement process with regard to existing claims and the additional claims it expects to receive in the future from its past business writings 
most of the remaining claims are in suit and the company s future results may or may not be impacted either negatively or positively based on its ability to settle the remaining claims and new anticipated claims within its established reserve level

for  the contribution to the premium increase by regions was southeast  south central  southwest and west 
net premiums earned increased in and in primarily as a result of the growth in gross premiums written 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  policy fees were recorded as premiums and recognized over the period of the policy  previously they were recorded in agency revenues and recognized as written 
net investment income increased  in primarily due to the increase in investments and the increase in bonds available for sale  which provide higher returns than short term investments

the company recorded net realized capital gains of   and  in  and  respectively 
variability in the timing of net realized capital gains and losses should be expected 
agency revenues increased  in and  in primarily as a result of the increase in writings

this item is primarily comprised of recognition of the deferred reinsurance gain from the reserve reinsurance cover agreement 
at december    remained to be recognized in other income in the future 

table of contents claims and claims adjustment expenses increased  in and increased  in the c cae ratio was in versus in and in the increase in the ratio for was primarily due to higher estimated ultimate liabilities in the nonstandard personal auto line which included a provision for extra contractual obligations on known claims  offset by favorable development of  in estimated ultimate liabilities in the runoff lines 
the decrease in the c cae ratio in was primarily related to favorable development in estimated ultimate liabilities of approximately  in the runoff lines 
the c cae ratio for nonstandard personal auto was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in this ratio from to was primarily due to higher estimated ultimate liabilities on business written in generally  new business initially produces higher claim ratios than more seasoned in force business  see item a 
risk factors 
the higher c cae ratios occurred primarily in the southeast and south central regions 
during  the company began implementing improved claim practices in each of the major regions claims departments in order to ultimately decrease the average time from when a claim occurs to when it is settled 
the company believes that  over the long term  timeliness in the settlement of claims is likely to produce the most favorable claim results for the company 
however  when this practice is initially implemented  it can cause an increase in the c cae and introduce greater uncertainty into the process of setting reserves 
the increase in c cae ratio from to was primarily due to favorable development in estimated ultimate liabilities in which recurred at a lower level of magnitude in than in and to generally higher ratios on new business 
with regard to environmental and product liability claims  the company has an immaterial amount of exposure 
the company did not provide environmental impairment coverage and excluded pollution and asbestos related coverages in its policies 
a portion of the company s remaining claims are related to construction defects 
inflation impacts the company by causing higher claim settlements than may have originally been estimated 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
policy acquisition costs include commission expense  change in deferred policy acquisition costs  premium taxes and regulatory fees and assessments 
the increase in and is primarily due to the increase in premium writings 
the ratio of policy acquisition costs to net premiums earned was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the southeast region  which generally has a lower policy acquisition costs ratio than the other regions  comprising a smaller portion of the mix in than in as a result of significant growth in the south central region 
the increase in interest expense is related to interest on the subordinated debentures issued in and the outstanding note payable 
see capital transaction subordinated debentures 
underwriting and operating expenses increased  in from and increased  in from primarily due to additional expenses incurred in the infrastructure expansion for increased premium production capability  specifically additional personnel 
the increase also includes non cash compensation expense of approximately million and million in and  respectively  associated with the grant of restricted shares and restricted share units of common stock under the company s long term incentive compensation plan 
in  the company began to achieve economies of scale from its infrastructure expansion 
underwriting and operating expenses as a percent of net premiums earned and agency revenues were for and for and the company recorded a deferred tax benefit in and primarily as a result of a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred federal income taxes of million and million  respectively

liquidity and capital resources parent company gan provides administrative and financial services for its wholly owned subsidiaries 
gan needs cash during primarily for administrative expenses and interest on the subordinated debentures and the note payable 
gan raised approximately in net proceeds as a result of its issuance of million in subordinated debentures in december  which it intends to use for general corporate purposes 
another source of cash to meet obligations is statutorily permitted dividend payments from its insurance subsidiary  general agents  an oklahoma corporation 
statutes in oklahoma restrict the payment of dividends by the insurance company to the available surplus funds 
the maximum amount of cash dividends that general agents may declare without regulatory approval in any month period is the greater of net income for the month period ended the previous december or ten percent of policyholders surplus as of the previous december for  the maximum amount of cash dividends that general agents may pay without regulatory approval is approximately  in addition  we have a credit arrangement with a commercial bank which can be used to provide for holding company funds 
gan believes its cash and short term investments should be sufficient to meet its expected obligations for net operating loss carryforwards as a result of losses in prior years  as of december  the company has net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes aggregating  these net operating loss carryforwards of    and  if not utilized  will expire in   and  respectively 
the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards is  which is calculated by applying the federal statutory income tax rate of against the net operating loss carryforwards of  the company currently has a partial valuation allowance for its net operating loss carryforwards of  based on management s analysis of available evidence  both objective and subjective 

table of contents deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has recorded a substantial gross deferred tax asset related to the expected realization of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
due to the uncertainty of utilization of the company s net operating losses and in consideration of other factors  management recorded a full valuation allowance on the gross deferred tax asset in the company considers available evidence  both objective and subjective  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of available evidence  both objective and subjective  as of the end of the fourth quarter of  it was considered more likely than not that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not required  resulting in the release of a portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets and generating a million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  management s analysis of available evidence  both objective and subjective  concluded it was more likely than not that additional portions of this asset would be used in future periods so the valuation allowance was reduced by million  producing a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of as of december   the company believes it is more likely than not that the amount of the deferred tax asset recorded will ultimately be recovered 
however  should circumstances cause this belief to change  the tax provision would increase in the period in which determination that recovery is not likely occurred 
as of december   the net deferred tax asset before valuation allowance was  and the valuation allowance was  in certain circumstances  section of the internal revenue code may apply to materially limit the amount of the company s taxable income that may be offset in a tax year by the company s net operating losses carried forward from prior years the limitation 
the annual limitation generally is an amount equal to the value of the company immediately before an ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate for the month in which the change occurs eg  if the ownership change occurred in december 
this annual limitation would apply to all years to which the net operating losses can be carried forward 
in general  the application of section occurs when the aggregate stock ownership percentage determined on the basis of value of shareholders has increased by more than percentage points over such shareholders lowest ownership percentages within a testing period generally a three year period ending on the date in which a transaction gives rise to a testing date 
in general  a shareholder is a person who directly or indirectly owns or more of the total value of the instruments that constitute stock for section purposes 
the term shareholder also refers to a group of shareholders that individually own less than of the total value of the outstanding stock and are referred to as a public group 
if a shareholder is an entity ie  a corporation  partnership or trust  then the corporation who has the nol carryforward referred to as a loss corporation is required to look through the entity and through any higher tier entity in order to determine which owners of the entity are indirectly shareholders 
it is the ownership of these ultimate shareholders  including public groups  that is considered when determining whether a greater than percentage point increase has occurred 
a testing date generally occurs whenever the percentage stock ownership by value of any shareholder changes 
thus  a disproportionate issuance of stock to existing shareholders or to new investors would give rise to a testing date  as would the transfer by an existing shareholder of some or all of its stock to a third party or an existing shareholder 
the company believes that the transactions described above did not cause a greater than percentage point ownership shift  thus section did not apply and impose a limitation on our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
however  the transactions described above did result in a substantial ownership shift 
future transactions in common stock by the company or others could affect the company s ability to utilize the net operating loss carryforwards

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company s critical accounting policies are described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments bonds available for sale are stated at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of comprehensive income 
short term investments are stated at cost 
the specific identification method is used to determine costs of investments sold 
provisions for possible losses are recorded only when the values have experienced impairment considered other than temporary by a charge to realized losses resulting in a new cost basis of the investment 
the company s policy is to review investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each investment has experienced an other than temporary impairment 
interest rate fluctuations and credit quality of the issuer impact the variability in the fair value 
see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of variability of estimates 
deferred policy acquisition costs and policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs are principally commissions  premium taxes  marketing and underwriting expenses which are deferred 
policy acquisition costs are principally commissions and premium taxes and the change in deferred policy acquisition costs that are charged to operations over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
the company utilizes investment income when assessing recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
recoverability is based upon assumptions as to claims ratios  investment income and maintenance expenses and would vary with changes in these estimates 

table of contents goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired 
the goodwill recorded is related to the acquisition of the lalande group 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but rather is subject to an annual impairment test  or earlier if certain factors are present  based on its estimated fair value 
therefore  impairment losses could be recorded in future periods 
these procedures require the gan to calculate the fair value of goodwill  compare the results to its carrying value and record the amount of any shortfall as an impairment charge 
gan performed this test as of december   using a variety of methods  including estimates of future discounted cash flows and comparisons of the market value to its major competitors as well as the overall market 
the test results indicated that there was no impairment loss at december  unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses accidents generally result in insurance companies paying under the insurance policies written by them amounts to individuals or companies for the risks insured 
months and sometimes years may elapse between the occurrence of an accident  reporting of the accident to the insurer and payment of the claim 
insurers record a liability for estimates of claims that will be paid for accidents reported to them  which are referred to as case reserves 
in addition  since accidents are not always reported promptly upon the occurrence and because the assessment of existing known claims may change over time with the development of new facts  circumstances and conditions  insurers estimate liabilities for such items  which are referred to as ibnr reserves incurred but not reported 
the company maintains reserves for the payment of claims and claim adjustment expenses for both case and ibnr under policies written by its subsidiaries 
these claims reserves are estimates  at a given point in time  of amounts that the company expects to pay on incurred claims based on facts and circumstances then known 
the amount of case claim reserves is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding the claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of claim 
the amount of ibnr claims reserves is determined on the basis of historical information and anticipated future conditions by lines of insurance and actuarial review 
reserves for claim adjustment expenses are intended to cover the ultimate costs of settling claims  including investigation and defense of lawsuits resulting from such claims 
inflation is implicitly reflected in the reserving process through analysis of cost trends and review of historical reserve results 
the process of establishing claims reserves is imprecise and reflects significant judgmental factors 
in many liability cases  significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of an insured claim and the settlement of the claim 
the actual emergence of claims and claim adjustment expenses may vary  perhaps materially  from the company s estimates thereof  because a estimates of claims and claim adjustment expense liabilities are subject to large potential errors of estimation as the ultimate disposition of claims incurred prior to the financial statement date  whether reported or not  is subject to the outcome of events that have not yet occurred eg  jury decisions  court interpretations  legislative changes even after coverage is written and reserves are initially set that broaden liability and policy definitions and increase the severity of claims obligations  subsequent damage to property  changes in the medical condition of claimants  public attitudes and social economic conditions such as inflation  b estimates of claims do not make provision for extraordinary future emergence of new classes of claims or types of claims not sufficiently represented in the company s historical data base or which are not yet quantifiable  and c estimates of future costs are subject to the inherent limitation on the ability to predict the aggregate course of future events 

table of contents ultimate liability may be greater or lower than current reserves 
reserves are monitored by the company using new information on reported claims and a variety of statistical techniques 
the company does not discount to present value that portion of its claim reserves expected to be paid in future periods 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred income tax items are accounted for under the asset and liability method which provides for temporary differences between the reporting of earnings for financial statement purposes and for tax purposes  primarily deferred policy acquisition costs  the discount on unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses  net operating loss carry forwards and the nondeductible portion of the change in unearned premiums 
deferred tax assets are evaluated and a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company has recorded a substantial gross deferred tax asset related to the expected realization of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes 
due to the uncertainty of utilization of the company s net operating losses and in consideration of other factors  management recorded a full valuation allowance on the gross deferred tax asset in the company considers available evidence  both objective and subjective  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
as a result of available evidence  both objective and subjective  as of the end of the fourth quarter of  it was considered more likely than not that a full valuation allowance for deferred tax assets was not required  resulting in the release of a portion of the valuation allowance previously recorded against deferred tax assets and generating a million tax benefit in the fourth quarter of in the fourth quarter of  management s analysis of available evidence  both objective and subjective  concluded it was more likely than not that additional portions of this asset would be used in future periods so the valuation allowance was reduced by million  producing a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of as of december   the company believes it is more likely than not that the amount of the deferred tax asset recorded will ultimately be recovered 
however  should circumstances cause this belief to change  the tax provision would increase in the period in which determination that recovery is not likely occurred

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of economic losses due to adverse changes in the estimated fair value of a financial instrument as the result of changes in equity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company s consolidated balance sheets include assets whose estimated fair values are subject to market risk 
the primary market risk to the company is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturities 
the company has no foreign exchange  commodity or equity risk 

table of contents interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity investments  all of which are available for sale and not for trading purposes  are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in interest rates typically result in decreases and increases in the fair value of these investments 
most of the company s investable assets are in the portfolios of the insurance company subsidiaries and come from premiums paid by policyholders 
these funds are invested predominately in high quality fixed maturities with relatively short durations and short term investments 
the fixed maturity portfolio had an average duration of years at december  the fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as interest rates rise  fair values decline and as interest rates fall  fair values rise 
the changes in the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is managed with consideration given to the estimated duration of the company s liabilities 
the company has investment policies that limit the maximum duration and maturity of the fixed maturity portfolio 
the company utilizes the modified duration method to estimate the effect of interest rate risk on the fair values of its fixed maturity portfolio 
the usefulness of this method is to a degree limited  as it is unable to accurately incorporate the full complexity of market interactions
