we can borrow money under our credit agreement to pay distributions  which would reduce the amount of credit available to operate our business 
our partnership agreement allows us to make working capital borrowings under our credit agreement to pay distributions 
accordingly  we can make distributions on all our units even though cash generated by our operations may not be sufficient to pay such distributions 
we are required to reduce our borrowings to zero under that portion of our credit agreement that is available to pay the minimum quarterly distribution for a period of at least consecutive days once each month period 
for more information  please read item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources credit agreement and note of notes to financial statements 
cost reimbursements due our general partner and its affiliates will reduce cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
prior to making any distribution on the common units  we reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all expenses they incur on our behalf  which is determined by our general partner in its sole discretion 
these expenses include all costs incurred by the general partner and its affiliates in managing and operating us  including costs for rendering corporate staff and support services to us 
we are managed and operated by directors and executive officers of our general partner 
in addition  the majority of our operating personnel are employees of our general partner 
please read item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
the reimbursement of expenses and payment of fees  if any  to our general partner and its affiliates could adversely affect our ability to pay cash distributions to our unitholders 
unitholders may not have limited liability if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
a general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
our partnership is organized under delaware law  and we conduct business in a number of other states 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business 
a unitholder could be liable for our obligations as if he were a general partner if a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state s partnership statute  or a unitholder s right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner  approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions 
under certain circumstances  unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act  we may not make a distribution to unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution  limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
purchasers of units who become limited partners are liable for the obligations of the transferring limited partner to make contributions to us that are known to the purchaser of units at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non recourse to us are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  there is no restriction in the partnership agreement on the ability of the members of our general partner from transferring their respective membership interests in our general partner to a third party 
the new members of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with their own choices and control the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers of our general partner 
certain members of the slifka family and their affiliates may engage in activities that compete directly with us 
certain members of the slifka family and their affiliates are subject to the noncompete provisions in the omnibus agreement 
the omnibus agreement does not prohibit certain affiliates of our general partner from owning certain assets or engaging in certain businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us 
please read item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence omnibus agreement 
tax risks our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service were to treat us as a corporation or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the internal revenue service irs on this or any other tax matter affecting us 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of  and would likely pay state tax at varying rates 
distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses  deductions or credits would flow through to unitholders 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be substantially reduced 
thus  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of the common units 
current law may change  causing us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to entity level taxation 
for example  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity  the cash available for distribution to unitholders would be reduced 
the partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts will be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 
we have a subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes and subject to corporate level income taxes 
we conduct all or a portion of our operations of our end user business through a subsidiary that is organized as a corporation 
we may elect to conduct additional operations through this corporate subsidiary in the future 
this corporate subsidiary is subject to corporate level tax  which reduces the cash available for distribution to us and  in turn  to unitholders 
if the irs were to successfully assert that this corporation has more tax liability than we anticipate or legislation was enacted that increased the corporate tax rate  our cash available for distribution to unitholders would be further reduced 
if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely impacted  and the costs of any contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to unitholders 
we have not requested any ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the tax positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  because the costs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner  the costs of any contest with the irs will result in a reduction in cash available for distribution 
unitholders may be required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because unitholders are treated as partners to whom we allocate taxable income  which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income  whether or not they receive cash distributions from us 
unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from their share of our taxable income 
tax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be different than expected 
if a unitholder sells his common units  he will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and his tax basis in those common units 
because distributions to a unitholder in excess of the unitholder s allocable share of our net taxable income decreases the unitholder s tax basis in his common units  the amount of such prior excess distributions will  in effect  become taxable income to him if the common units are sold at a price greater than his tax basis in the common units  even if the price he receives is less than his original cost 
furthermore  a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be taxed as ordinary income to the unitholder due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our non recourse liabilities  if a unitholder sells his units  he may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash he receives from the sale 
tax exempt entities and foreign persons face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts known as iras  and non us persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  are unrelated business taxable income and taxable to them 
distributions to non us persons are reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non us persons are required to file the us federal income tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
we treat each purchaser of common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could decrease the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units  we adopted depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could decrease the amount of tax benefits available to unitholders 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from a unitholder s sale of common units and have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to unitholders tax returns 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  unitholders may be subject to other taxes  such as state and local income taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
unitholders may be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions 
further  unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
as of december   we conducted business in states  some of which may impose a state income tax 
we may own property or conduct business in other states or foreign countries in the future 
it is the unitholder s responsibility to file all federal  state and local tax returns 
item b 
unresolved staff comments

item legal proceedings 
general although we may  from time to time  be involved in litigation and claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business  we do not believe that we are a party to any litigation that will have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
except as described below  we are not aware of any significant legal or governmental proceedings against us  or contemplated to be brought against us 
we maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles as our general partner believes are reasonable and prudent 
however  we can provide no assurance that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices 
environmental global companies llc  in addition to several affiliates  has been named as one of over defendants in two lawsuits alleging methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe contamination of groundwater in massachusetts 
mtbe is an oxygenate that has been used extensively to reduce motor vehicle tailpipe emissions 
in the cases of town of duxbury  et al 
v 
amerada hess corp  et al  filed december   and city of lowell v 
amerada hess corp  et al  filed december   plaintiffs allege that manufacturers  refiners and others involved in the distribution of gasoline containing mtbe are liable for the costs of investigating possible mtbe groundwater contamination  treating such contaminated groundwater where found  and related relief including treble damages and injunctive relief 
the plaintiffs in these cases generally claim to be public water providers or municipal or other government authorities 
these cases have been consolidated in multi district litigation with over other mtbe cases in federal court in the southern district of new york 
we intend to vigorously defend these cases 
we do not believe that these cases will have a material impact on our operations although we can provide no assurances in this regard 
on november   a consent decree was lodged by the us department of justice in the federal district court for massachusetts whereby global companies llc and global petroleum corp 
settled alleged violations of clean air act regulations related to fuel quality specifications 
this consent decree was entered by the court on january  as part of this settlement  global companies llc has paid a  civil penalty and instituted a compliance program for three years to ensure compliance with clean air act fuel quality specifications 
the alleged violations stemmed from the importation of finished conventional gasoline  which was not a substantial part of our operations at the time of the alleged violations 
we do not believe that compliance with the terms of the consent decree will result in material costs 
in november  the epa  region iii epa  region iii notified global companies llc  as the operator of a petroleum marketing and bulk storage terminal in macungie  pennsylvania of epa s intention to negotiate an administrative order on consent aoc with global companies llc and the previous owner and owners of an adjacent terminal to investigate and remediate petroleum in the soil and groundwater at the two sites 
we are continuing to work with the other companies  including the previous owner of our terminal  to negotiate an aoc with epa 
while we cannot predict the outcome of these negotiations and any subsequent environmental investigation of these sites  we do not expect that this outcome will have a material adverse effect on us 
other on september   the office of the attorney general of the commonwealth of massachusetts issued a civil investigative demand to us in connection with an investigation of gasoline distributors and retailers in massachusetts in the wake of hurricane katrina 
we believe that the attorney general s office has issued similar demands to other distributors and retailers 
we have taken steps to comply with the demand 
while we cannot predict the outcome of the investigation  we do not expect that the outcome will have a material adverse effect on us 
item submission of matters to a vote of security holders 
no matter was submitted to a vote of security holders during the fourth quarter of part ii item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities our common units trade on the new york stock exchange under the symbol glp 
the closing sale price per common unit on march  was 
at the close of business on march   based upon information received from our transfer agent and brokers and nominees  we had approximately  common unitholders  including beneficial owners of common units held in street name 
the following table sets forth the range of the daily high and low sales prices per common unit as quoted on the new york stock exchange and the cash distributions per common unit for the periods indicated 
price range cash distribution high low per common unit fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter fourth quarter cash distributions declared in one calendar quarter are paid in the following calendar quarter 
on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared this distribution for the period from october  through december  which was paid on february  this distribution reflects the pro rata portion of the quarterly distribution rate of  covering the period from the closing of the initial public offering  october  through december  we intend to consider cash distributions to unitholders on a quarterly basis  although there is no assurance as to the future cash distributions since they are dependent upon future earnings  cash flow  capital requirements  financial condition and other factors 
our credit agreement prohibits us from making cash distributions if any potential default or event of default  as defined in the credit agreement  occurs or would result from the cash distribution 
within days after the end of each quarter  we will distribute all of our available cash as defined in our partnership agreement to unitholders of record on the applicable record date 
the amount of available cash generally is all cash on hand at the end of the quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business  comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments  or other agreements  or provide funds for distributions to our unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters  plus all cash on hand on the date of determination of available cash for the quarter resulting from working capital borrowings made after the end of the quarter 
working capital borrowings as defined in our partnership agreement are generally borrowings that are made under our revolving credit facility and in all cases are used solely for working capital purposes or to pay distributions to partners 
affiliates of the slifka family own  subordinated units 
during the subordination period  the common units will have the right to receive distributions of available cash from operating surplus in an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution of per quarter  plus any arrearages in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units from prior quarters  before any distributions of available cash from operating surplus may be made on the subordinated units 
these units are deemed subordinated units because for a period of time  referred to as the subordination period  the subordinated units will not be entitled to receive any distributions until the common units have received the minimum quarterly distribution and any arrearages from prior quarters 
furthermore  no arrearages will be paid on the subordinated units 
the practical effect of the subordinated units is to increase the likelihood that during the subordination period there will be available cash to be distributed on the common units 
the subordination period will extend until the first day of any quarter beginning after september  that each of the following tests are met distributions of available cash from operating surplus on each of the outstanding common units and subordinated units and general partner units equaled or exceeded the minimum quarterly distribution for each of the three consecutive  non overlapping four quarter periods immediately preceding that date  the adjusted operating surplus as defined in our partnership agreement generated during each of the three consecutive  non overlapping four quarter periods immediately preceding that date equaled or exceeded the sum of the minimum quarterly distributions on all of the outstanding common units and subordinated units during those periods on a fully diluted basis and the related distribution on the general partner units during those periods  and there are no arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units 
if the unitholders remove the general partner without cause  the subordination period may end before september  in addition  if the tests for ending the subordination period are satisfied for any three consecutive four quarter periods ending on or after september   of the subordinated units will convert into an equal number of common units 
similarly  if those tests are also satisfied for any three consecutive four quarter periods ending on or after september   an additional of the subordinated units will convert into an equal number of common units 
the second early conversion of subordinated units may not occur  however  until at least one year following the end of the period for the first early conversion of subordinated units 
we will make distributions of available cash from operating surplus for any quarter during any subordination period in the following manner firstly  to the common unitholders  pro rata  and to the general partner  until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter  secondly  to the common unitholders  pro rata  and to the general partner  until we distribute for each outstanding common unit an amount equal to any arrearages in payment of the minimum quarterly distribution on the common units for any prior quarters during the subordination period  thirdly  to the subordinated unitholders  pro rata  and to the general partner  until we distribute for each subordinated unit an amount equal to the minimum quarterly distribution for that quarter  and thereafter  cash in excess of the minimum quarterly distributions is distributed to the unitholders and the general partner based on the percentages below 
the general partner  global gp llc  is entitled to incentive distributions if the amount we distribute with respect to any quarter exceeds specified target levels shown below total quarterly distribution marginal percentage interest in distributions target amount unitholders general partner minimum quarterly distribution first target distribution up to second target distribution above up to third target distribution above up to thereafter above the equity compensation plan information required by item d of regulation s k in response to this item is incorporated by reference from item  security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management equity compensation plan table

overview general we own  control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products in the northeast 
we are one of the largest wholesale distributors of gasoline  distillates such as home heating oil  diesel and kerosene and residual oil to wholesalers  retailers and commercial customers in the northeast 
in  we sold approximately billion of refined petroleum products and small amounts of natural gas 
we purchase our refined petroleum products primarily from domestic and foreign refiners  traders and producers and sell these products in two segments  wholesale and commercial 
like most independent marketers of refined petroleum products  we base our pricing on spot physical prices and routinely use the nymex or derivatives to hedge our commodity risk inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives  we maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations 
we earn a margin by selling the product for physical delivery to third parties 
products and operational structure our products include gasoline  distillates and residual oil 
we sell gasoline to unbranded retail gasoline stations and resellers 
the distillates we sell are used primarily for fuel for trucks and off road construction equipment and for space heating of residential and commercial buildings 
we sell residual oil to major housing units  such as public housing authorities  colleges and hospitals and large industrial facilities that use processed steam in their manufacturing processes 
in addition  we sell bunker fuel  which we can custom blend  to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets 
our business is divided into two segments wholesale 
this segment includes sales of gasoline  distillates and residual oil to unbranded retail gasoline stations and other resellers of transportation fuels  home heating oil retailers and wholesale distributors 
commercial 
this segment includes sales and deliveries of unbranded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and small amounts of natural gas to customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial customers  either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms 
this segment also purchases  custom blends  sells and delivers bunker fuel and diesel to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets generally by barges 
our business activities are substantially comprised of purchasing  terminalling  storing and selling refined petroleum products 
we believe that the combination of our terminalling and storage activities  together with our marketing activities  provides a balance that has a stabilizing effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
our results of operations are less weather sensitive than they have been in the past 
in  our volume in transportation fuels  which represents a growing portion of our sales and is not impacted by weather conditions  exceeded our home heating oil volumes 
the increase in the non weather sensitive components of our business helps to partially offset the economic impact that warmer weather conditions may have on our home heating oil and residual oil sales 
in addition  substantial portions of our heating oil are sold on a forward fixed basis 
in a contango market when product prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current month for delivery to customers at higher prices in future months 
in a backwardated market when product prices for future deliveries are lower than for current deliveries because of our high turnover of inventory  we are able to minimize our inventories and commodity risk while attempting to maintain or increase net product margins 
outlook this section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future  both in the short term and in the long term 
our results of operations and financial condition depend in part upon the following we commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions  though there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers of terminalling  storage and or marketing assets and related businesses 
in an effort to prudently and economically leverage our asset base  knowledge base and skill sets  management has also expanded its efforts to pursue businesses that are closely related to or significantly intertwined with our existing lines of business 
our growth may depend on our ability to make accretive acquisitions 
we may be unable to make such accretive acquisitions for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them  we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or we are outbid by competitors 
in addition  we may consummate acquisitions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive  but that ultimately may not be accretive 
if any of these events were to occur  our future growth would be limited 
we can give no assurance that our current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms that are favorable to us 
our financial results are generally better in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
demand for some refined petroleum products  specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes  is generally higher during november through march than during april through october 
we obtain a significant portion of our sales during these winter months 
therefore  our results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally better than for the second and third quarters 
with lower cash flow during the second and third calendar quarters  we may be required to borrow money in order to pay the minimum quarterly distribution to our unitholders 
warmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and residual oil 
because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter  warmer than normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in one or more regions in which we operate can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales 
energy efficiency  new technology and alternative fuels  natural gas in particular  could reduce demand for our products 
increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil 
consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades 
we could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government mandated controls or regulation further promoting the use of cleaner fuels 
due in part to support for conversion to natural gas on environmental grounds  some industrial residual oil users have switched to natural gas 
those end users who are dual fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas 
during a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas  dual fuel customers may switch to natural gas or  over the long term  may convert to natural gas 
such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
new  stricter environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regulating product quality specifications and other environmental matters 
the trend in environmental regulation is towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations 
we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
however  there can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith 
results of operations evaluating our results of operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include net product margin  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  operating expenses  heating degree days  adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit  ebitda and distributable cash flow 
net product margin we view net product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review net product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
we define net product margin as our sales minus product costs 
sales include sales of unbranded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and natural gas 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products that we sell and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
gross profit we define gross profit as our sales minus product costs and terminal depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales 
sales include sales of unbranded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and natural gas 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products that we sell and all associated costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a expenses include marketing costs  corporate overhead  employee salaries and benefits  pension and k plan expenses  discretionary bonuses  non interest financing costs  professional fees and information technology expenses 
employee related expenses including employee salaries  discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes  and benefits  pension and k plan expenses are paid by our general partner which  in turn  is reimbursed for these expenses by us 
operating expenses operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals used in our business 
lease payments and storage expenses  maintenance and repair  utilities  taxes  labor and labor related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our system but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
degree day a degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption 
degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of f 
each degree of temperature above f is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below f is counted as one heating degree day 
degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long term multi year average  or normal  to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual 
degree days are officially observed by the national weather service and officially archived by the national climatic data center 
for purposes of evaluating our results of operations  we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the national weather service at its logan international airport station in boston  massachusetts 
adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit we use adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit to measure our financial performance on a per unit basis 
adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit is defined as net income after adding back the theoretical amount allocated to the general partner s interest as provided under emerging issues task force eitf  participating securities and the two class method under fasb statement no 
eitf  divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted limited partner units during the period 
net income per diluted limited partner unit as dictated by eitf is theoretical and pro forma in nature and does not reflect the economic probabilities of whether earnings for an accounting period would or could be distributed to unitholders 
the partnership agreement does not provide for the quarterly distribution of net income  rather  it provides for the distribution of available cash  which is a contractually defined term that generally means all cash on hand at the end of each quarter after establishment of sufficient cash reserves required to operate our business 
accordingly  the distributions we historically paid and will pay in future periods are not impacted by net income per diluted limited partner unit as dictated by eitf however  adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income per diluted limited partner unit or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our adjusted net income per diluted limited partner unit may not be comparable to the adjusted net incomer per diluted limited partner unit or similarly titled measure of other companies 
ebitda ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts  to assess our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements  our financial performance without regard to financing methods  capital structure  income taxes or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners  our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale marketing and distribution of refined petroleum products business  without regard to financing methods and capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and operating income  and these measures may vary among other companies 
therefore  ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
distributable cash flow distributable cash flow also is an important non gaap financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distribution 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
however  distributable cash flow is a non gaap financial measure and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies

capital improvement expenditures include expenditures to acquire assets to grow our business and to expand existing facilities  such as projects that increase operating capacity by increasing tankage or adding terminals 
we had approximately million in capital improvement expenditures for the year ended december  to increase our operating capacity and capabilities 
we did not incur capital improvement expenditures in the years ended december  and repair and maintenance expenses associated with existing assets that are minor in nature and do not extend the useful life of existing assets are charged to operating expenses as incurred 
we anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will be funded with cash generated by operations 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquid assets  cash flow from operations  borrowing capacity under our credit agreement and the ability to issue additional common units and or debt securities under our shelf registration to meet our financial commitments  debt service obligations  contingencies and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  we are subject to business and operational risks that could adversely affect our cash flow 
a material decrease in our cash flows would likely produce a corollary adverse effect on our borrowing capacity

for a complete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations affecting our business  please read items and  business and properties environmental 
critical accounting policies and estimates a summary of the significant accounting policies that we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our consolidated combined financial statements is detailed in note of notes to financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the use of estimates 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis 
these estimates are based on our knowledge and understanding of current conditions and actions that we may take in the future 
changes in these estimates will occur as a result of the passage of time and the occurrence of future events 
subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
inventory we hedge substantially all of our inventory purchases through futures and swap agreements 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized currently in earnings  resulting in inventory approximating lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
in addition to our own inventory  we have exchange agreements with unrelated third party suppliers  whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and replace it at a later date 
similarly  these suppliers may draw inventory from us and replace it at a later date 
positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable 
negative exchange balances are accounted for as accounts payable 
exchange transactions are valued using current quoted market prices 
leases we have a throughput agreement with global petroleum corp  one of our affiliates  with respect to the revere terminal in revere  massachusetts 
this agreement is accounted for as an operating lease

our leases are accounted for under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  which requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
revenue recognition sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products and natural gas and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery  net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of sale based on the estimated future outcome 
we also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale  which are included in cost of sales 
the amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis  such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers 
bad debt provisions are included in selling  general and administrative expense 
revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements  which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products of a desired quality or reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets 
in accordance with eitf no 
 accounting for purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty  any net differential for exchange agreements is recorded as an adjustment of inventory costs in the purchases component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
derivative financial instruments we account for our derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure the instruments at fair value 
the fair value of our derivatives is determined through the use of independent markets and is based upon the prevailing market prices of such instruments at the date of valuation 
we enter into futures contracts for the receipt or delivery of refined petroleum products in future periods 
the contracts are entered into in the normal course of business to reduce risk of loss on inventory on hand  which could result through fluctuations in market prices 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized currently in earnings 
we also use futures contracts and swaps to hedge exposure under forward purchase and sale commitments 
these agreements are intended to hedge the cost component of virtually all of our forward commitments 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as offsetting gains or losses on the forward fixed purchase and sale commitments  are recognized currently in earnings 
gains and losses on net product margin from forward fixed purchase and sale contracts are reflected in earnings as these contracts mature 
we also market and sell natural gas 
we generally conduct business by entering into forward purchase commitments for natural gas only when we simultaneously enter into arrangements for the sale of product for physical delivery to third party users 
we generally take delivery under our purchase commitments at the same location as we deliver to third party users 
through these transactions  which establish an immediate margin  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between firm forward purchase and sales commitments 
natural gas is generally purchased and sold at fixed prices and quantities 
current price quotes from actively traded markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts fair value 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized currently in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
environmental and other liabilities we record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes 
we provide for losses associated with environmental remediation obligations when such losses are probable and reasonably estimable 
estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
we are subject to other contingencies  including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters  including  among others  environmental matters  contract and employment claims 
environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses we previously owned 
further  due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations  there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated 
recent accounting pronouncements a description and related impact expected from the adoption of certain new accounting pronouncements is provided in note of notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and commodity risk 
we utilize various derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity risk 
because the outstanding amount under our credit facility fluctuates due to commodity prices and the seasonality of our business  we have chosen currently and historically not to enter into any hedging instruments related to our variable rate debt 
interest rate risk we utilize variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our current credit facility and term loan 
therefore  from time to time  we may utilize interest rate swaps and collars to hedge interest obligations on specific and anticipated debt issuances 
we had no interest rate hedging instruments outstanding as of december  borrowings under our working capital revolving credit  acquisition credit and revolving credit facilities currently bear interest at our option at the eurodollar rate  plus  or  respectively  the cost of funds rate  plus  or  respectively  and the bank s base rate the average rate for the year ended december  was 
as of december   we had total borrowings outstanding under our working capital revolving credit facility of million 
the impact of a increase in the interest rate on this amount of debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in our results of operations  of approximately million annually  assuming  however  that our indebtedness remained constant throughout the year 
commodity risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to refined petroleum products in storage and expected purchases and sales of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures and option contracts traded on the nymex and over the counter transactions  including swap contracts entered into with established financial institutions and other credit approved energy companies 
our policy is generally to purchase only products for which we have a market and to structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect the profit we receive 
while our policies are designed to minimize market risk  some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our product purchase activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of refined petroleum products 
we enter into future contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on our purchase and fixed forward sales of refined petroleum products 
any hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in our results of operations 
we utilize the nymex  which is a regulated exchange for energy products that it trades  thereby reducing potential delivery and supply risks 
generally  our practice is to close all nymex positions rather than to make or receive physical deliveries 
with respect to other energy products  we enter into derivative agreements with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile  in order to hedge market fluctuations and or lock in margins relative to our commitments 
at december   the fair value of all of our commodity risk derivative instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a price decrease are shown in the table below in thousands loss gain fair value after fair value at effect of december  price decrease nymex contracts swaps  options and other  net the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at december  for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the spot market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
we have a daily margin requirement to maintain a cash deposit with our broker based on the prior day s market results on open futures contracts 
the balance of this deposit will fluctuate based on our open market positions and the commodity exchange s requirements 
the required brokerage margin balance was million at december  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties of forward contracts  options and swap agreements  but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties 
futures contracts  the primary derivative instrument utilized  are traded on regulated exchanges  greatly reducing potential credit risks 
exposure on swap and certain option agreements is limited to the amount of the recorded fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
we utilize primarily one broker  a major financial institution  for all derivative transactions and the right of offset exists 
accordingly  the fair value of all derivative instruments is displayed on a net basis
