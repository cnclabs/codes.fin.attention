table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview genaera corporation is a biopharmaceutical company committed to developing medicines for serious diseases to address substantial unmet medical needs 
research and development efforts are focused on obesity  anti angiogenesis and respiratory diseases 
we have four products in development addressing substantial unmet medical needs in major pharmaceutical markets 
since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales 
we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities  research and development collaboration payments and related equity investments 
we have incurred a loss in each year since our inception and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we will need to raise additional funds in the future to continue our operations 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the previous three years in the period ended december  the financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting policies important to our financial condition and results of operations that require management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized at the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through development collaboration is recognized on a straight line basis over the development period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as liabilities until earned 
payments received that are refundable also are classified as liabilities until the refund provision expires 
we make an estimate as to the appropriate deferral period for recognition of revenue on any collaborative fees received 
changes in these estimates due to the evolution of the development program can have a significant effect on the timing of when revenue is recorded 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees and facility costs 
research and development expenses consist of independent research and development contract costs  contract manufacturing costs and costs associated with collaborative research and development arrangements 
in addition  we fund research and development at other research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable 
research and development expenses also include external activities  such as investigator sponsored trials 
all such costs 
table of contents are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the initiation of certain contracts  we must make an estimate as to the duration and expected completion date of the contract  which may require a change due to accelerations  delays or other adjustments to the contract period or work performed 
changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on the amount of research and development costs in a specific period 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation using the modified prospective method set forth by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost for all stock based awards be measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with the company s valuation technique previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
such amounts  net of estimated forfeitures  will be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated method under sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense was recorded for the excess of the stock s quoted market price at the time of grant over the amount an employee had to pay to acquire the stock 
because our equity compensation plans require stock options to be granted at prices equal to or above the fair market value of the company s common stock on the grant dates  no compensation expense related to employee options was recorded prior to january  under the intrinsic value method 
results of operations vs 
revenues we have received no revenues to date from product sales 
revenues recorded to date have consisted principally of revenues recognized under collaborations with third parties 
in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with medimmune to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
medimmune provided funding of million  payable in eight equal quarterly installments through april the r d funding 
in addition  medimmune reimburses external costs for certain research and development activities and for patent prosecution expenses 
we could also receive up to million of additional funding based on successful completion of future milestones 
in august  we received the first of such milestone payments as a result of the initiation of phase i clinical trials 
in december  we received a milestone payment as a result of the initiation of phase ii clinical trials 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue related to external cost reimbursements million and milestone payments million 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue related to external cost reimbursements 
in february  we received a phase ii small business innovative research sbir program grant from the national institutes of health nih in the amount of million to support its aminosterol research program 
the grant extended over a two year period  which ended in february in february  we notified the nih of a no cost extension of the original budget period by twelve months 
as a result of the notification  the grant was extended through february we recognized million as revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  in april  we received a phase i sbir program grant from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases of the nih in the amount of million to support its trodusquemine formerly 
table of contents trodulamine program 
the grant extended over a one year period which ended in march in march  we notified the nih of a no cost extension to the original budget period by twelve months 
as a result of the notification  the grant was extended to march we recognized million of revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  we recognized no revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  in september  we received a phase i sbir program grant from the national eye institute of the nih in the amount of million to support its aminosterols for age related macular degeneration program 
the grant extended over a one year period  which ended in august in august  we notified the nih of a no cost extension to the original budget period by twelve months 
as a result of the notification  the grant was extended to august we recognized million of revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  we recognized no revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  in february  we entered into an agreement to provide pexiganan cream to a research facility for its conduct of a research study 
as a result of this agreement  we recognized  as revenue in the year ended december  research and development expenses our current research and development programs include trodusquemine msi for the treatment of obesity and metabolic disorders  squalamine lactate  lomucin talniflumate  il and other programs consisting of other aminosterols for the treatment of inflammatory disorders and locilex pexiganan cream for the treatment of infectious disease 
the following table illustrates our research and development projects and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status trodusquemine research preclinical active squalamine squalamine phase ii active evizon squalamine phase ii iii inactive lomucin phase ii active il phase ii active other programs other aminosterols research active locilex cream phase iii inactive in january  we announced the termination of our evizon clinical development program for the treatment of wet amd 
due to slower than expected enrollment  reporting of the one year outcomes from the study will not occur before in april  we entered into a collaborative agreement with medimmune to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
research and development expenses for each of our projects consist of both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies for each project 
we also may incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  clinical development and manufacturing costs and consulting costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 

table of contents we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses in thousands incurred during the years ended december  and for our significant groups of research and development projects 
years ended december  squalamine program expenses lomucin program expenses il program expenses trodusquemine program expenses other program expenses indirect expenses research and development expenses decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to decreases in clinical trial costs million  third party contract research million  manufacturing million  consulting expenses million and research and development supplies million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of wet amd  decreases in clinical trial costs million related to our lomucin program and decreases in third party contract research million related to our il program 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in personnel costs million  manufacturing expenses million  third party contract research million and costs for consulting million related to our trodusquemine obesity therapeutic program  as well as increases in personnel costs million and manufacturing expenses million related to our lomucin program 
in addition  indirect expenses increased primarily due to stock based compensation expense for stock options from the adoption of sfas r million  increased temporary labor million and increased equipment rental and maintenance million 
the costs incurred to date on each of our development projects are not reasonably estimable because work on one program often supports or enhances another program 
for example  it is not possible to separate the time and resources spent in development of squalamine lactate as a product candidate to treat wet amd and as a product candidate to treat cancer because i early research and development efforts devoted to cancer research led to development of our product candidate squalamine lactate trade name evizon for amd  ii clinical trial work pursuant to genaera s ind application for cancer forms part of the safety data base for the ind it filed with the fda for wet amd  iii our manufacturing development for squalamine lactate supports both the amd and cancer programs  iv trodusquemine and squalamine are synthesized from the same starting material and a significant number of steps in the synthesis are identical  and v nonclinical testing conducted supports all regulatory filings and proposed indications for squalamine 
the level of research and development expenses in future periods will depend principally upon the progress of our research and development programs and our capital resources 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
preclinical and clinical studies may yield varying results that could delay  limit or prevent a program s advancement through the various stages of product development and significantly impact the costs to be incurred and the time involved in bringing a program to completion 
such delays  limitations or prevention of a program s advancement could harm our financial condition and operating results and inhibit our ability to raise additional funds to support ongoing operations 
the nature of costs incurred in the future will also vary depending upon the stage of the product candidate s development 
product candidates in the research stage often require significant laboratory work to develop and prepare the product candidate for preclinical testing and for testing in humans 
costs for such work typically 
table of contents include our staff  our facilities  lab supplies and equipment and fees to contract research facilities supervised by our personnel 
all products to be tested in humans require preclinical testing and often require additional nonclinical testing while clinical trials are in process to fulfill regulatory requirements 
preclinical and nonclinical work requires expenditures for staffing and facilities 
costs will also be incurred for work done by contract research facilities under our supervision 
early stage products require development of manufacturing methods  supporting analytical and research work and qualifying vendors  including contract manufacturers 
products in human testing  particularly later stage trials  require manufacturing more significant quantities of product 
the costs of conducting clinical trials include fees to contract research organizations to conduct the trials  payments to physicians and research centers  and payments for a wide range of services to prepare for clinical trials  support the trials and manage data gathered in the trials 
internal costs for clinical trials include staffing and infrastructure to design  adapt and manage the trials  as well as managing vendors providing supporting services 
smaller but continuing costs throughout the clinical trials process also include quality control and regulatory compliance activities conducted by genaera staff and through contractors under our supervision 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
general and administrative costs increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due principally to increases in stock based compensation expense for stock options from the adoption of sfas r million and increases in investor and public relations expense million due to the transition to a new investor and public relations service provider 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in personnel costs million  severance costs million  bonus expense million and restricted stock compensation expense million associated with the resignation of our previous chief executive officer in interest income and other we recognized interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from cash and investments 
interest income increased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates

table of contents research and development expenses we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses in thousands incurred during the years ended december  and for our significant groups of research and development projects 
years ended december  squalamine program expenses lomucin program expenses il program expenses other program expenses indirect expenses research and development expenses increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to increases in clinical trial costs million  personnel costs million and costs for research and development supplies million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of age related macular degeneration  as well as increases in clinical trial costs million related to our lomucin program 
in addition  indirect expenses increased million as a result of increased overhead  such as utilities  insurance and general facilities costs related to additional personnel 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in third party contract research million  manufacturing million and consulting expenses million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of age related macular degeneration  decreases in manufacturing expenses million related to our lomucin program  as well as decreases in other program expenses million 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
general and administrative costs increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due principally to increases in personnel as a result of our expanded development efforts million  payment related to the resignation of the company s prior chief executive officer million and increased consulting expenses million 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in patent filing fees million and decreased investor relations expenses million 
interest income and other we recognized interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from cash and investments 
interest income increased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to higher average investment balances and higher interest rates 
we recognized a loss on the write off of fixed assets of million in the year ended december  as a result of the sale of excess research equipment 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary use of cash was to fund our research and development operations 
current liabilities decreased by million from million at december  to million at december   due primarily to a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses resulting from the timing and magnitude of our current research and development contracts 

table of contents our capital expenditure requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements  the demand for products based on our technology  if and when such products are approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  our goal is to conduct significant research  pre clinical development  clinical testing and manufacturing activities over the next several years 
we expect that these activities  together with projected general and administrative expenses  will result in continued and significant losses 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of our securities totaling approximately million since our initial public offering in december and including the proceeds from the following private placements of our securities  net of costs  in  and million january  million november  million september  and million june in addition to the above  we have funded our operations from contract and grant revenues  research and development expense reimbursements  interest income  lease financing and debt financing 
we regularly explore alternative means of financing our operations and seek funding through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  collaborative arrangements with third parties and other strategic alliances and business transactions 
we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds  and may be unable to obtain sufficient funding in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain funding  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate research and development programs or enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize potential products or technologies that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or seek other arrangements 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
additional factors that may impact our ability to raise capital are described under risk factors 
in june  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock for net proceeds of million 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  are sufficient to meet our research and development goals and sustain operations through contractual cash obligations the table below sets forth our contractual obligations at december  in thousands cash payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease on building operating leases and maintenance contracts on equipment total contractual cash obligations this table does not include various agreements that we have entered into for services with third party vendors  including agreements to conduct clinical trials  to manufacture product candidates  and for consulting and other contracted services  due to the cancelable nature of the services 
we accrue the costs of these agreements based on estimates of work completed to date 
the lease provides for an annual rent escalation of  beginning on december  and an additional rent escalation of beginning on december

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with interest rate changes 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we invest in only us government  government agency  corporate and bank or institutional money market funds with investment standards comparable to our investment policy 
the policy limits the amount of credit exposure we may have to any one issue  issuer or type of investment other than us government debt 
as of december   our portfolio investments consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents and million in us treasury or us government agency debt instruments having a maturity of less than one year 
due to the nature of our investment portfolio  management believes that a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that if the average annualized yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
correspondingly  if the average annualized yield of our investments had increased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have increased by million 
this estimate assumes that the increase occurred on the first day of and increased the annualized yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exchange rate risk
