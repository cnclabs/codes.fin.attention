business strategy  potential corporate restructuring the key elements of our business strategy have included using our resources to grow our restaurant and asset management businesses  evaluating and making various acquisitions and business combinations  whether in the restaurant industry  the asset management industry or other industries  building strong operating management teams for each of our businesses and providing strategic leadership and financial resources to enable these management teams to develop and implement specific  growth oriented business plans 
the implementation of this business strategy may result in increases in expenditures for  among other things  acquisitions and  over time  marketing and advertising 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
unless circumstances dictate otherwise  it is our policy to publicly announce an acquisition or business combination only after an agreement with respect to such acquisition or business combination has been reached 
we are continuing to explore a possible corporate restructuring that is expected to involve the disposition of our asset management operations  whether through a sale of our ownership interest in deerfield  a spin off of our ownership interest in deerfield to our stockholders or such other means as our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interests of our stockholders 
any such corporate restructuring is currently expected to  and any other form of corporate restructuring could  involve nelson peltz  our chairman and chief executive officer  peter w 
may  our president and chief operating officer  edward p 
garden  our vice chairman  and certain other senior officers and employees of triarc no longer being officers and employees of triarc  in which case it is expected that triarc would be led by the current management team of arby s 
in connection with the potential restructuring  in addition to our regular quarterly dividends  in we declared and paid special cash dividends aggregating per share on each outstanding share of our class a common stock and class b common stock  series the special cash dividends were paid in three installments of per share on each of march  july and december  options for our remaining non restaurant net assets are also under review and could include the allocation of these net assets between our two businesses arby s and deerfield and or additional special dividends or distributions to our stockholders 
depending on the nature of the restructuring  various arrangements relating to the affected businesses could be necessary  the cost of which has not been determined 
among other things  we have employment agreements and severance arrangements with certain of our executive officers and corporate employees 
if we proceed with a restructuring  we would incur significant severance or contractual settlement payments under these agreements and arrangements  which would result in triarc being relieved of its long term obligations under the employment agreements 
in the case of messrs 
peltz and may  the amount of such payments would be subject to negotiation and approval by a special committee comprised of independent members of our board of directors  which is considering these matters 
there can be no assurance that a corporate restructuring will occur or the form  terms or timing of such restructuring if it does occur 
our board of directors has not reached any definitive conclusions concerning the form  scope  benefits or timing of the corporate restructuring 
on november   messrs 
peltz  may and garden collectively  the principals started a series of equity investment funds the funds that are separate and distinct from triarc and that are being managed by the principals and certain other senior officers and employees of triarc the employees through a management company the management company formed by the principals 
the investment strategy of the funds is to achieve capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of publicly traded companies and effecting positive change through active hands on influence and involvement 
in contrast  deerfield is an asset manager focusing on fixed income and credit related strategies with approximately billion of assets under management as of december   none of which was invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
before agreeing to acquire more than of the outstanding securities of a company in the quick service restaurant segment in which arby s operates  the principals have agreed to offer us such acquisition opportunity 
the principals and employees continue to serve as officers and employees of  and receive compensation from  triarc 
triarc is making available the services of the principals and the employees  as well as certain support services including investment research  legal  accounting and administrative services  to the management company 
the length of time that these management services will be provided has not yet been determined 
triarc is being reimbursed by the management company for the allocable cost of these services  including an allocable portion of base salaries  rent and various overhead costs for periods both before and after the launch of the funds 
such allocated costs amounted to million for the year ended december  in addition  certain of the incentive compensation paid by triarc to messrs 
peltz and may and all of the incentive compensation paid by triarc to mr 
garden and the employees reflects an allocation of their time between the services that they provided in to triarc and to the management company 
as a result of this allocation  triarc reduced its incentive compensation expense in by an aggregate of approximately million 
a special committee comprised of independent members of our board of directors has reviewed and considered the support service arrangements and allocations  and the compensation committee and the performance compensation subcommittee  as applicable  have approved the amounts of the incentive compensation paid by triarc to the principals and the employees 
at december   our consolidated indebtedness was approximately million  including approximately million of debt of our restaurant subsidiaries 
the debt of our restaurant subsidiaries has neither been guaranteed by triarc nor secured by triarc s cash  cash equivalents or investments 
fiscal year we use a week fiscal year convention for triarc and most of our subsidiaries whereby our fiscal year ends each year on the sunday that is closest to december of that year 
each fiscal year generally is comprised of four week fiscal quarters  although in some years one quarter represents a week period

business segments restaurant franchising and operations arby s the arby s restaurant system through arby s restaurant group  inc arg and its subsidiaries  we participate in the quick service restaurant segment of the restaurant industry as the franchisor of the arby s restaurant system and  as of december   the owner and operator of  arby s restaurants 
we acquired our company owned arby s restaurants principally through the acquisitions of sybra  inc in december and the rtm restaurant group in july we acquire additional company owned restaurants from time to time through acquisitions as well as the development and construction of new restaurants 
there are approximately  arby s restaurants in the united states and canada and arby s is the largest restaurant franchising system specializing in the roast beef sandwich segment of the quick service restaurant industry 
according to nation s restaurant news  arby s is the th largest quick service restaurant chain in the united states 
as of december   there were  company owned arby s restaurants and  arby s restaurants owned by franchisees 
of the  franchisee owned restaurants   operated within the united states and operated outside the united states 
arg also owns the tj cinnamons concept  which consists of gourmet cinnamon rolls  gourmet coffees and other related products  and the pasta connection concept  which includes pasta dishes with a variety of different sauces 
as of december   there were a total of tj cinnamons outlets  of which are multi branded with domestic arby s restaurants  and nine pasta connection outlets  all of which are multi branded with domestic arby s restaurants 
arg is not currently offering to sell any additional pasta connection franchises 
as of december   arg also owned and operated one arby s market fresh unit 
developed as a test design  the arby s market fresh unit features an expansion of arby s successful market fresh line of premium sandwiches and salads within an in line shopping center 
in addition to various slow roasted roast beef sandwiches  arby s offers an extensive menu of chicken  turkey and ham sandwiches  side dishes and salads 
in  arby s introduced its market fresh line of premium sandwiches on a nationwide basis 
since its introduction  the arby s market fresh line has grown to include fresh salads made with premium ingredients such as fresh apples  dried cranberries  corn salsa and black beans 
arby s also offers market fresh wrap sandwiches with the same ingredients as its market fresh sandwiches inside a tortilla wrap 
during the first quarter of  arby s replaced its entire line of chicken products with arby s chicken naturals  a line of menu offerings made with percent all natural chicken breast that is not altered or injected with added water  salt or phosphates 
in the fourth quarter of  arby s began serving french fries with zero grams of trans fat 
to accomplish this  arby s worked with its french fry suppliers to eliminate the use of hydrogenated oil during the par frying process at the supplier level  allowing arby s to become the first national quick service restaurant chain to announce the elimination of trans fat oils in french fries from supplier to restaurant 
that transition is expected to be fully implemented in all domestic arby s locations by the end of the second quarter of during  arg opened new arby s restaurants and two arby s market fresh test restaurants and closed ten generally underperforming arby s restaurants  two underperforming arby s market fresh test restaurants and two tj cinnamons outlets located in arby s units

risk factors our restaurant business is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings  which may be affected by factors beyond our control 
overview as the franchisor of the arby s restaurant system  arg  through its subsidiaries  owns and licenses the right to use the arby s brand name and trademarks in the operation of arby s restaurants 
arg provides arby s franchisees with services designed to increase both the revenue and profitability of their arby s restaurants 
the more important of these services are providing strategic leadership for the brand  product development  quality control  operational training and counseling regarding site selection 
the revenues from our restaurant business are derived from three principal sources franchise royalties received from all arby s franchised restaurants  up front franchise fees from restaurant operators for each new unit opened  and sales at company owned restaurants 
references herein to arg may include one or more of arg s subsidiaries  as applicable 
arby s restaurants arby s opened its first restaurant in boardman  ohio in as of december   arg and arby s franchisees operated arby s restaurants in states  the district of columbia and four foreign countries 
as of december   the six leading states by number of operating units were ohio  with restaurants  michigan  with restaurants  indiana  with restaurants  florida  with restaurants  texas  with restaurants  and georgia  with restaurants 
the country outside the united states with the most operating units is canada with restaurants as of december  arby s restaurants in the united states and canada typically range in size from  square feet to  square feet 
at december   approximately of freestanding system wide restaurants including approximately of freestanding company owned restaurants featured drive thru windows 
restaurants typically have a manager  at least one assistant manager and as many as full and part time employees 
staffing levels  which vary during the day  tend to be heaviest during the lunch hours 
the following table sets forth the number of arby s restaurants at the beginning and end of each year from to restaurants open at beginning of period restaurants opened during period restaurants closed during period restaurants open at end of period during the period from december  through december   new arby s restaurants were opened and generally underperforming arby s restaurants were closed 
we believe that closing underperforming arby s restaurants has contributed to an increase in the average annual unit sales volume of the arby s system  as well as to an improvement of the overall brand image of arby s 
as of december   arg owned or operated  domestic arby s restaurants 
of these  restaurants   were freestanding units  were in shopping malls  were in office buildings urban in line locations  were in convenience stores  were in travel plazas and were in strip center locations 
franchise network arg seeks to identify potential franchisees that have experience in owning and operating quick service restaurant units  have a willingness to develop and operate arby s restaurants and have sufficient net worth 
arg identifies applicants through its website  targeted mailings  maintaining a presence at industry trade shows and conventions  existing customer and supplier contacts and regularly placed advertisements in trade and other publications 
prospective franchisees are contacted by an arg sales agent and complete an application for a franchise 
as part of the application process  arg requires and reviews substantial documentation  including financial statements and documents relating to the corporate or other business organization of the applicant 
franchisees that already operate one or more arby s restaurants must satisfy certain criteria in order to be eligible to enter into additional franchise agreements  including capital resources commensurate with the proposed development plan submitted by the franchisee  a commitment by the franchisee to employ trained restaurant management and to maintain proper staffing levels  compliance by the franchisee with all of its existing franchise agreements  a record of operation in compliance with arby s operating standards  a satisfactory credit rating and the absence of any existing or threatened legal disputes with arby s 
the initial term of the typical traditional franchise agreement is years 
arg currently does not offer any financing arrangements to franchisees seeking to build new franchised units 
in  arg terminated a program offered through cit group to provide remodel financing to arby s franchisees  with arg having no financial obligations under the program 
arg continues to evaluate potential new financial programs to assist franchisees in remodeling existing arby s restaurants 
as of december   canadian franchisees have committed to open two arby s restaurants over the next two years 
during  one new arby s unit was opened in canada and four arby s units in canada were closed 
during  no other arby s units were opened or closed outside the united states 
arg offers franchises for the development of both single and multiple traditional restaurant locations 
both new and existing franchisees may enter into either a development agreement  which requires the franchisee to develop two or more arby s restaurants in a particular geographic area within a specified time period  or a license option agreement that grants the franchisee the option  exercisable for a one year period  to build an arby s restaurant on a specified site 
all franchisees are required to execute standard franchise agreements 
arg s standard us franchise agreement for new arby s franchises currently requires an initial  franchise fee for the first franchised unit and  for each subsequent unit and a monthly royalty payment equal to of restaurant sales for the term of the franchise agreement 
franchisees typically pay a  commitment fee  which is credited against the franchise fee during the development process for a new restaurant 
because of lower royalty rates still in effect under earlier agreements  the average royalty rate paid by us franchisees was approximately in and and in franchised restaurants are required to be operated under uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection  quality and preparation of menu items  signage  decor  equipment  uniforms  suppliers  maintenance and cleanliness of premises and customer service 
arg monitors franchisee operations and inspects restaurants periodically to ensure that company practices and procedures are being followed 
acquisitions and dispositions of arby s restaurants as part of arg s continuous efforts to enhance the arby s brand  grow the arby s system and improve arby s system operations  arg from time to time acquires or sells individual or multiple arby s restaurants 
arg may use such transactions as a way of further developing a targeted market 
for example  arg may sell a number of restaurants in a particular market to a franchisee and obtain a commitment from the franchisee to develop additional restaurants in that market 
or  arg may acquire restaurants from a franchisee demonstrating a limited desire to grow and then seek to further penetrate that market through the development of additional company owned restaurants 
arg believes that dispositions of multiple restaurants at once can also be an effective strategy for attracting new franchisees who seek to be multiple unit operators with the opportunity to benefit from economies of scale 
in addition  arg may acquire restaurants from a franchisee who wishes to exit the arby s system 
when arg acquires underperforming restaurants  it seeks to improve their results of operations and then either continues to operate them as company owned restaurants or re sells them to new or existing franchisees 
advertising and marketing arby s advertises nationally on several cable television networks 
in addition  from time to time  arby s will sponsor a nationally televised event or participate in a promotional tie in for a movie 
locally  arby s primarily advertises through regional network and cable television  radio and newspapers 
the afa service corporation the afa  an independent membership corporation in which every domestic arby s franchisee is required to participate  was formed to create advertising and perform marketing for the arby s system 
the afa is funded primarily through member contributions 
arg and arby s franchisees contribute of net sales of their domestic arby s restaurants to the afa 
arg and arby s franchisees are also required to contribute incremental dues to the afa equal to of net sales of their domestic arby s restaurants to help fund national advertising programs bringing their total contribution to the afa for advertising and marketing to of net sales 
effective october  arg and the afa entered into a management agreement that arg believes enables a closer working relationship between arg and the afa  allows for improved collaboration on strategic marketing decisions and creates certain operational efficiencies  thus benefiting the arby s system as a whole 
pursuant to the management agreement  arg assumed general responsibility for the day to day operations of the afa  including preparing annual operating budgets  developing the brand marketing strategy and plan  recommending advertising agencies and media buying agencies  and implementing all marketing media plans 
arg performs these tasks subject to the approval of the afa s board of directors 
in addition to these responsibilities  arg is obligated to pay for the general and administrative costs of the afa  other than the cost of an annual audit of the afa and certain other expenses specifically retained by the afa 
arg incurred expenses of approximately million to cover the afa s general and administrative costs for  a portion of which was offset by the afa s payment of million to arg  as required under the management agreement 
the afa is required to pay an additional million and  to arg in and  respectively  to defray a portion of these costs 
beginning in and for each year thereafter  the afa will no longer be required to make any such payments to arg 
under the management agreement  arg is also required to provide the afa with appropriate office space at no cost to the afa 
the management agreement with the afa continues in effect until terminated by either party upon one year s prior written notice 
in addition  the afa may terminate the management agreement upon six months prior written notice if there is a change in the identity of any two of the individuals holding the titles of chief executive officer  chief operating officer or chief administrative officer of arg in any period of months 
in addition to their contributions to the afa  arg and arby s franchisees are also required to spend a reasonable amount  but not less than of net sales of their arby s restaurants  for local advertising 
this amount is divided between i individual local market advertising expenses and ii expenses of a cooperative area advertising program 
contributions to the cooperative area advertising program  in which both company owned and franchisee owned restaurants participate  are determined by the local cooperative participants and are generally in the range of to of net sales 
in december  arby s announced that in it will be a primary sponsor of roush racing s nascar team led by driver matt kenseth and his ford race car in busch series events and one nextel cup series event 
the arby s nascar relationship will be supported through national and local television advertising  radio  print  in store merchandising and the arby s website 
provisions and supplies as of december   two independent meat processors supplied all of arby s beef for roasting in the united states 
franchise operators are required to obtain beef for roasting from these approved suppliers 
arcop  inc  a not for profit purchasing cooperative  negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of arg and arby s franchisees 
suppliers to the arby s system must comply with united states department of agriculture usda and united states food and drug administration fda regulations governing the manufacture  packaging  storage  distribution and sale of all food and packaging products 
franchisees may obtain other products  including food  ingredients  paper goods  equipment and signs  from any source that meets arg s specifications and approval 
through arcop  arg and arby s franchisees purchase food  beverage  proprietary paper and operating supplies under national contracts employing volume purchasing 
quality assurance arg has developed a quality assurance program designed to maintain standards and the uniformity of menu offerings at all arby s restaurants 
arg assigns a quality assurance employee to each of the independent facilities that process beef for domestic arby s restaurants 
the quality assurance employee inspects the beef for quality and uniformity and to assure compliance with quality and safety requirements of the usda and the fda 
in addition  arg periodically evaluates randomly selected samples of beef and other products from its supply chain 
each year  arg representatives conduct unannounced inspections of operations of a number of franchisees to ensure that arg policies  practices and procedures are being followed 
arg field representatives also provide a variety of on site consulting services to franchisees 
arg has the right to terminate franchise agreements if franchisees fail to comply with quality standards 
trademarks arg  through its subsidiaries  owns several trademarks that we consider to be material to our restaurant business  including arby s  arby s market fresh  market fresh  tj cinnamons  horsey sauce  sidekickers and arby s chicken naturals 
arg s material trademarks are registered in the us patent and trademark office and various foreign jurisdictions 
our registrations for such trademarks in the united states will last indefinitely as long as arg continues to use and police the trademarks and renew filings with the applicable governmental offices 
there are no pending challenges to arg s right to use any of its material trademarks in the united states 
competition arby s faces direct and indirect competition from numerous well established competitors  including national and regional non burger sandwich chains  such as panera bread  subway and quiznos  as well as hamburger chains  such as mcdonald s  burger king and wendy s  and other quick service restaurant chains  such as taco bell  chick fil a and kentucky fried chicken 
in addition  arby s competes with locally owned restaurants  drive ins  diners and other similar establishments 
key competitive factors in the quick service restaurant industry are price  quality of products  quality and speed of service  advertising  name identification  restaurant location and attractiveness of facilities 
arby s also competes within the food service industry and the quick service restaurant sector not only for customers  but also for personnel  suitable real estate sites and qualified franchisees 
many of the leading restaurant chains have focused on new unit development as one strategy to increase market share through increased consumer awareness and convenience 
this has led to increased competition for available development sites and higher development costs for those sites 
this has also led some competitors to employ other strategies  including frequent use of price discounting and promotions and heavy advertising expenditures 
continued price discounting in the quick service restaurant industry and the re emphasis on value menus could have an adverse impact on us 
in addition  the growth of fast casual chains and other in line competitors could cause some fast food customers to trade up to a more traditional dining out experience while keeping the benefits of quick service dining 
other restaurant chains have also competed by offering higher quality sandwiches made with fresh ingredients and artisan breads 
several chains have also sought to compete by targeting certain consumer groups  such as capitalizing on trends toward certain types of diets eg  low carbohydrate or low trans fat by offering menu items that are specifically identified as being consistent with such diets 
additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have recently come from operators outside the restaurant industry 
several major grocery chains now offer fully prepared food and meals to go as part of their deli sections 
some of these chains also have in store cafes with service counters and tables where consumers can order and consume a full menu of items prepared especially for that portion of the operation 
additionally  convenience stores and retail outlets at gas stations frequently offer sandwiches and other foods 
many of our competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do 
governmental regulations various state laws and the federal trade commission regulate arg s franchising activities 
the federal trade commission requires that franchisors make extensive disclosure to prospective franchisees before the execution of a franchise agreement 
several states require registration and disclosure in connection with franchise offers and sales and have franchise relationship laws that limit the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or to withhold consent to the renewal or transfer of these agreements 
in addition  arg and arby s franchisees must comply with the federal fair labor standards act and the americans with disabilities act the ada  which requires that all public accommodations and commercial facilities meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons  and various state and local laws governing matters that include  for example  the handling  preparation and sale of food and beverages  minimum wages  overtime and other working and safety conditions 
compliance with the ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of fines by the us government or an award of damages to private litigants 
as described more fully under item legal proceedings  one of arg s subsidiaries was a defendant in a lawsuit alleging failure to comply with title iii of the ada at approximately company owned restaurants acquired as part of the july acquisition of the rtm restaurant group 
under a court approved settlement of that lawsuit  we estimate that arg will spend approximately million per year of capital expenditures over an eight year period beginning in to bring these restaurants into compliance with the ada  in addition to paying certain legal fees and expenses 
we do not believe that the costs related to this matter or any other costs relating to compliance with the ada will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we cannot predict the effect on our operations  particularly on our relationship with franchisees  of any pending or future legislation

the structured loan fund representing approximately million in assets under management is invested mainly in bank loans 
of the three hedge funds  dcm manages one fund representing approximately million in assets under management mainly pursuant to arbitrage strategies  one fund representing approximately million in assets under management mainly pursuant to a flight to quality strategy  and one fund representing approximately million in assets under management mainly pursuant to global macro strategies 
the arbitrage and flight to quality strategy hedge funds invest mainly in government securities and related instruments  such as interest rate swaps and futures contracts 
the global macro fund invests in various instruments  such as options  currencies  fixed income instruments and futures contracts 
advisory fees dcm s revenue consists predominantly of investment advisory fees from the accounts it manages 
dcm receives a periodic management fee from each account that generally is based on the net assets of the account 
this fee ranges from approximately to per year of the net principal balance for cdos  per year of net assets for hedge funds  per year of net assets for the reit  per year of net assets for the structured loan fund  and to per year of net assets for the managed accounts 
dcm is also entitled to a performance fee from many of its accounts  generally based upon a percentage of the annual net profits generated by the account in the case of the hedge funds or the returns to certain investors in the case of the cdos 
dcm also receives from certain cdos a structuring fee  which is a one time fee for dcm s services in assisting in structuring the cdo  payable upon formation of the cdo 
dcm receives its advisory fees pursuant to investment management agreements entered into with its clients 
the terms of these agreements vary  ranging from contracts that are continuous but terminable by the client to those that have terms ranging from one to three years subject to renewal upon expiration of the initial terms 
in general  these agreements are terminable by the clients  in most cases only for cause but in some instances without cause 
under dcm s investment management agreement with the reit  at the end of the initial term of the agreement which occurs on december  or at the end of any one year renewal term thereafter  dcm can be removed as manager by a vote of at least two thirds of the reit s independent directors or holders of at least a majority of the outstanding common stock of the reit based upon unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to the reit or a determination that the management fees payable to dcm are not fair subject to dcm s right to prevent such a termination by accepting a reduction of management fees that at least two thirds of the reit s independent directors determine to be fair 
during  dcm generated approximately of its revenue from managing the reit 
marketing dcm markets its cdo and reit management services to institutions that organize and act as selling or placement agents for cdos and reits 
dcm markets its hedge fund and separate account management services directly to existing and prospective investors in the hedge funds and separate accounts 
dcm also markets its services through presentations to investment advisory consultants to pension plans and other institutional investors 
dcm s asset management services are marketed privately rather than through general advertising or solicitation 
competition the principal markets for dcm s asset management services are high net worth individual and institutional investors that wish to allocate a portion of their investment capital to alternative fixed income asset management strategies 
dcm competes for such clients with numerous other asset managers  some of which like dcm concentrate on fixed income instruments and others that are more diversified 
the factors considered by clients in choosing dcm or a competing asset management firm include the past performance of the accounts managed by the firm  the background and experience of its key portfolio management personnel  its reputation in the fixed income asset management industry  its advisory fees  and the structural features of the investment products such as cdos and hedge funds that it offers 
some of dcm s competitors have greater portfolio management resources than dcm  have managed client accounts for longer periods of time or have other competitive advantages over dcm 
governmental regulations dcm is registered with the sec as an investment adviser and with the us commodity futures trading commission as a commodity pool operator and commodity trading advisor 
dcm is also a member of the national futures association  the self regulatory organization for the us commodity futures industry 
in these capacities  dcm is subject to various regulatory requirements and restrictions with respect to its asset management activities in addition to other laws  such as regulations relating to promotional materials  the custody of client funds  allocation of investment opportunities among client accounts  recordkeeping  supervision  the establishment of compliance procedures  investing in securities by dcm employees  conflicts of interest  the prevention of money laundering  and ethical standards 
in addition  investment vehicles managed by dcm  such as hedge funds and the reit  are subject to various securities and other laws 
in  deerfield formed dcm europe  a united kingdom based subsidiary  in order to expand dcm s overseas business 
dcm europe is subject to significant regulation by the united kingdom financial services authority under the uk financial services and markets act of while dcm believes that it and the investment vehicles it manages are substantially in compliance with all applicable regulatory and other legal requirements  dcm and such investment vehicles may incur significant additional costs to comply with such requirements and any additional requirements that may be imposed in the future 
however  we do not believe that any such cost increase would materially affect the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other services in connection with its management of client investment vehicles  dcm typically provides other services to those vehicles in addition to investment advice  such as selecting the brokerage firms and counterparties through which the vehicles conduct their investing and assisting the vehicles in obtaining the financing needed to leverage their investing 
also  dcm provides day to day administrative services to the reit in addition to managing its investment portfolio 
intellectual property we have developed rights in the trademarks and trade names deerfield and deerfield capital management  which we consider to be material to our business 
we have licensed the triarc and deerfield names to the reit on a non exclusive basis 
under our license agreement with the reit  these licenses may be terminated if an affiliate of triarc or deerfield  as applicable  ceases to serve as investment manager of the reit 
general environmental matters our past and present operations are governed by federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances 
these laws and regulations provide for significant fines  penalties and liabilities  sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted 
we similarly cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with any environmental laws or regulations or to satisfy any claims relating to environmental laws or regulations 
we believe that our operations comply substantially with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
accordingly  the environmental matters in which we are involved generally relate either to properties that our subsidiaries own  but on which they no longer have any operations  or properties that we or our subsidiaries have sold to third parties  but for which we or our subsidiaries remain liable or contingently liable for any related environmental costs 
our company owned arby s restaurants have not been the subject of any material environmental matters 
based on currently available information  including defenses available to us and or our subsidiaries  and our current reserve levels  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of the environmental matter discussed below or in which we are otherwise involved will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
in  a vacant property owned by adams packing association  inc adams packing  an inactive subsidiary of ours  was listed by the united states environmental protection agency on the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability information system  which we refer to as cerclis  list of known or suspected contaminated sites 
the cerclis listing appears to have been based on an allegation that a former tenant of adams packing conducted drum recycling operations at the site from some time prior to until the late s 
the business operations of adams packing were sold in december in february  adams packing and the florida department of environmental protection  which we refer to as the florida dep  agreed to a consent order that provided for development of a work plan for further investigation of the site and limited remediation of the identified contamination 
in may  the florida dep approved the work plan submitted by adams packing s environmental consultant and the work under that plan has been completed 
adams packing submitted its contamination assessment report to the florida dep in march in august  the florida dep agreed to a monitoring plan consisting of two sampling events  which occurred in january and june  and the results were submitted to the florida dep for its review 
in november  adams packing received a letter from the florida dep identifying certain open issues with respect to the property 
the letter did not specify whether any further actions are required to be taken by adams packing and adams packing has sought clarification from  and continues to expect to have additional conversations with  the florida dep in order to attempt to resolve the matter 
based on provisions made prior to of approximately million for costs associated with this matter  and after taking into consideration various legal defenses available to us  including adams packing  adams packing has provided for its estimate of its remaining liability for completion of this matter 
accordingly  this matter is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations legal and environmental matters 
seasonality our consolidated results are not significantly impacted by seasonality 
however  our restaurant revenues are somewhat lower in our first quarter 
further  while our asset management business is not directly affected by seasonality  our asset management revenues likely will be higher in our fourth quarter as a result of our revenue recognition accounting policy for incentive fees related to certain funds managed by deerfield  which fees are usually based upon calendar year performance and are recognized when the amounts become fixed and determinable upon the close of a performance fee measurement period 
employees as of december   we had a total of  employees  including  salaried employees and  hourly employees 
of these  are employed by triarc   are employed by arg and are employed by deerfield 
as of december   none of our employees was covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
item a 
risk factors 
we wish to caution readers that in addition to the important factors described elsewhere in this form k  the following important factors  among others  sometimes have affected  or in the future could affect  our actual results and could cause our actual consolidated results during  and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
risks related to triarc a substantial amount of our shares of class a common stock and class b common stock is concentrated in the hands of certain stockholders 
as of february   nelson peltz  our chairman and chief executive officer  and peter may  our president and chief operating officer  beneficially owned shares of our outstanding class a common stock and class b common stock  series  that collectively constituted approximately of our class a common stock  of our class b common stock and of our total voting power 
messrs 
peltz and may may from time to time acquire additional shares of class a common stock  including by exchanging some or all of their shares of class b common stock for shares of class a common stock 
additionally  we may from time to time repurchase shares of class a common stock or class b common stock 
such transactions could result in messrs 
peltz and may together owning more than a majority of our outstanding voting power 
if that were to occur  messrs 
peltz and may would be able to determine the outcome of the election of members of our board of directors and the outcome of corporate actions requiring majority stockholder approval  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
they would also be in a position to prevent or cause a change in control of us 
in addition  to the extent we issue additional shares of our class b common stock for acquisitions  financings or compensation purposes  such issuances would not proportionally dilute the voting power of existing stockholders  including messrs 
peltz and may 
our success depends substantially upon the continued retention of certain key personnel 
we believe that over time our success has been dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our and our subsidiaries senior management teams 
the failure by us to retain members of our and or our subsidiaries senior management teams could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts we have undertaken to increase the efficiency and profitability of our businesses 
specifically  in the event a corporate restructuring is not completed  the loss of nelson peltz  our chairman and chief executive officer  or peter may  our president and chief operating officer  or other members of our senior management team could adversely affect us 
we are continuing to explore a possible corporate restructuring that is expected to involve the disposition of our asset management operations  whether through a sale of our ownership interest in deerfield  a spin off of our ownership interest in deerfield to our stockholders or such other means as our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interests of our stockholders 
if the corporate restructuring is completed  it is currently anticipated that triarc would be renamed arby s and would be led by arg s current chief executive officer  roland smith  and the remainder of arg s management team 
following the corporate restructuring  although messrs 
peltz and may will continue to be large stockholders and directors of arby s  it is currently expected that they and other members of our existing senior management team would no longer be involved as senior executives of arby s and the success of the arby s business would depend to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of arby s senior management team 
see item business business strategy  potential corporate restructuring 
equity investment funds started by the principals may create a conflict of interests between the funds and us 
on november   the principals started the funds  which are separate and distinct from us and are being managed by the principals and the employees through the management company 
although the principals and the employees continue to serve as officers and employees of  and receive compensation from  us  we are making the services of the principals and the employees available to the management company 
consequently  the principals and the employees are no longer providing their services exclusively to us 
triarc is being reimbursed by the management company for the allocable cost of these and other support services being made available to the management company 
the arrangement by which the principals and the employees provide these services was reviewed and considered by a special committee comprised of independent directors of our board of directors 
see item business business strategy  potential corporate restructuring 
the investment strategy of the funds is to achieve capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of publicly traded companies and effecting positive change through active hands on influence and involvement 
in contrast  deerfield is an asset manager focusing on fixed income and credit related strategies with approximately billion of assets under management as of december   none of which was invested in equity securities of publicly traded companies 
although neither the funds nor deerfield currently plans to change its investment strategy  a change in investment strategy by either party in the future may create conflicts of interest between the funds and us 
the funds have invested and may continue to invest from time to time in companies that compete with arby s or deerfield 
in addition  while the principals have agreed to offer us the opportunity to acquire more than of the outstanding securities of a company in the quick service restaurant segment  if we decline to exercise such opportunity  the funds could consummate such an acquisition 
we have broad discretion in the use of our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash equivalents  investments other than investments held in deferred compensation trusts and receivables from sales of investments  net of liabilities related to investments 
the foregoing amounts do not reflect regular quarterly cash dividends of per share on our class a common stock and per share on our class b common stock that were declared on february  and are scheduled to be paid on march  in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
we have not otherwise designated any specific use for our cash  cash equivalents and investment position 
in connection with the potential corporate restructuring  in addition to expected significant severance or contractual settlement payments  options for our remaining non restaurant net assets are under review and could include the allocation of such assets between our businesses arby s and deerfield and or additional special dividends or distributions to our stockholders 
acquisitions have been a key element of our business strategy  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition targets in the future and that we will be able to successfully integrate any future acquisitions into our existing operations 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties assimilating new operations and products 
in addition  acquisitions may require significant management time and capital resources 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions on satisfactory terms  that any acquisition would result in long term benefits to us or that management would be able to manage effectively the resulting business 
future acquisitions  if any  are likely to result in the incurrence of additional indebtedness  which could contain restrictive covenants  or the issuance of additional equity securities  which could dilute our existing stockholders 
we cannot assure you that our proposed corporate restructuring will be successfully implemented 
we are continuing to explore the feasibility  as well as the risks and opportunities  of a possible corporate restructuring that is expected to involve the disposition of our asset management operations  whether through a sale of our ownership interest in deerfield  a spin off of our ownership interest in deerfield to our stockholders or such other means as our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interests of our stockholders 
there can be no assurance that the corporate restructuring will occur or the form  terms or timing of such restructuring if it does occur 
our failure to implement these transactions timely and economically could materially increase our costs and impair our results of operations 
even if the restructuring is completed  there can be no assurance that the expected benefits to triarc and its stockholders would be realized 
our investment of excess funds may be subject to risk  particularly due to use of leverage and the riskiness of underlying assets 
from time to time we place our excess cash in investment funds managed by third parties including the management company 
some of these funds use substantial leverage in their trading  including through the use of borrowed funds  total return swaps and or other derivatives 
the use of leverage generates various risks  including the exacerbation of losses  increased interest expense in the case of leverage through borrowing  and exposure to counterparty risk in the case of leverage through derivatives 
however  volatility in the value of a fund is a function not only of the amount of leverage employed but also of the riskiness of the underlying investments 
therefore  the greater the amount of leverage used by a fund and the greater the riskiness of a fund s underlying assets  the greater the risk associated with our investment in such fund 
in the future  we may have to take actions that we would not otherwise take so as not to be subject to tax as a personal holding company 
if at any time during the last half of our taxable year  five or fewer individuals own or are deemed to own more than of the total value of our shares and if during such taxable year we receive or more of our gross income  as specially adjusted  from specified passive sources  we would be classified as a personal holding company for us federal income tax purposes 
if this were the case  we would be subject to additional taxes at the rate of on a portion of our income  to the extent this income is not distributed to stockholders 
we do not currently expect to have any liability in for tax under the personal holding company rules 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not become liable for such tax in the future 
because we do not wish to be classified as a personal holding company or to incur any personal holding company tax  we may be required in the future to take actions that we would not otherwise take 
these actions may influence our strategic and business decisions  including causing us to conduct our business and acquire or dispose of investments differently than we otherwise would 
our certificate of incorporation contains certain anti takeover provisions and permits our board of directors to issue preferred stock and additional series of class b common stock without stockholder approval 
certain provisions in our certificate of incorporation are intended to discourage or delay a hostile takeover of control of us 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of shares of blank check preferred stock and additional series of class b common stock  which will have such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors is empowered  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock and or class b common stock with dividend  liquidation  conversion  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of our class a common stock and class b common stock  series the preferred stock and additional series of class b common stock could be used to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of us that is determined by our board of directors to be undesirable 
although we have no present intention to issue any shares of preferred stock or additional series of class b common stock  we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future 
risks related to arby s our restaurant business is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings  which may be affected by factors beyond our control 
our restaurant business derives earnings from sales at company owned restaurants  franchise royalties received from all arby s restaurants and up front fees from restaurant operators for each new unit opened 
growth in our restaurant revenues and earnings is significantly dependent on new restaurant openings 
numerous factors beyond our control may affect restaurant openings 
these factors include but are not limited to our ability to attract new franchisees  the availability of site locations for new restaurants  the ability of potential restaurant owners to obtain financing  the ability of restaurant owners to hire  train and retain qualified operating personnel  the availability of construction materials and labor  construction and development costs of new restaurants  particularly in highly competitive markets  the ability of restaurant owners to secure required governmental approvals and permits in a timely manner  or at all  and adverse weather conditions 
although as of december   franchisees had signed commitments to open arby s restaurants over the next six years and have made or are required to make non refundable deposits of  per restaurant  we cannot assure you that franchisees will meet these commitments and that they will result in open restaurants 
see item business business segments restaurant franchising and operations arby s franchise network 
arby s franchisees could take actions that could harm our business 
arby s franchisees are contractually obligated to operate their restaurants in accordance with the standards arg sets in its agreements with them 
arg also provides training and support to franchisees 
however  franchisees are independent third parties that arg does not control  and the franchisees own  operate and oversee the daily operations of their restaurants 
as a result  the ultimate success and quality of any franchise restaurant rests with the franchisee 
if franchisees do not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with arg s standards  the arby s image and reputation could be harmed  which in turn could hurt arg s business and operating results 
arg s success depends on arby s franchisees participation in arg s strategy 
arby s franchisees are an integral part of arg s business 
arg may be unable to successfully implement arg s brand strategies that it believes are necessary for further growth if arby s franchisees do not participate in that implementation 
the failure of arg s franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations such as quality  service and cleanliness would have a negative impact on arg s success 
arg s financial results are affected by the financial results of arby s franchisees 
arg receives revenue in the form of royalties and fees from arby s franchisees  which are generally based on a percentage of sales at franchised restaurants 
accordingly  a substantial portion of arg s financial results is to a large extent dependent upon the operational and financial success of arby s franchisees  including their implementation of arg s strategic plans 
if sales trends or economic conditions worsen for arby s franchisees  their financial results may worsen and arg s collection rates may decline 
when arg divests company owned restaurants  arg is often required to remain responsible for lease payments for these restaurants to the extent that the relevant franchisees default on their leases 
additionally  if arby s franchisees fail to renew their franchise agreements  or if arg is required to restructure its franchise agreements in connection with such renewal  it would result in decreased revenues for arg 
arg may be unable to manage effectively its strategy of acquiring and disposing of arby s restaurants  which could adversely affect arg s business and financial results 
arg s strategy of acquiring arby s restaurants from franchisees and eventually re franchising these restaurants by selling them to new or existing franchisees is dependent upon the availability of sellers and buyers as well as arg s ability to negotiate transactions on terms that arg deems acceptable 
in addition  the operations of restaurants that arg acquires may not be integrated successfully  and the intended benefits of such transactions may not be realized 
acquisitions of arby s restaurants pose various risks to arg s on going operations  including diversion of management attention to the integration of acquired restaurant operations  increased operating expenses and the inability to achieve expected cost savings and operating efficiencies  exposure to liabilities arising out of sellers prior operations of acquired restaurants  and incurrence or assumption of debt to finance acquisitions or improvements and or the assumption of long term  non cancelable leases 
in addition  engaging in acquisitions and dispositions places increased demands on arg s operational  financial and management resources and may require arg to continue to expand these resources 
if arg is unable to manage the acquisition and disposition strategy effectively  its business and financial results could be adversely affected 
arg does not exercise ultimate control over advertising and purchasing for the arby s restaurant system  which could hurt sales and the arby s brand 
arby s franchisees control the provision of national advertising and marketing services to the arby s franchise system through afa service corporation the afa  a company controlled by arby s franchisees 
subject to arg s right to protect its trademarks  and except to the extent that arg participates in the afa through its company owned restaurants  the afa has the right to approve all significant decisions regarding the national marketing and advertising strategies and the creative content of advertising for the arby s system 
although arg has entered into a management agreement pursuant to which arg  on behalf of the afa  manages the day to day operations of the afa  many areas are still subject to ultimate approval by the afa s independent board of directors and the management agreement may be terminated by either party for any reason upon one year s prior notice 
see item business business segments restaurant franchising and operations arby s advertising and marketing 
in addition  local cooperatives run by operators of arby s restaurants in a particular local area including arg make their own decisions regarding local advertising expenditures  subject to spending the required minimum amounts 
arg s lack of control over advertising could hurt sales and the arby s brand 
in addition  although arg ensures that all suppliers to the arby s system meet quality control standards  arby s franchisees control the purchasing of food  proprietary paper  equipment and other operating supplies from such suppliers through arcop  inc  a not for profit entity controlled by arby s franchisees 
arcop negotiates national contracts for such food  equipment and supplies 
arg is entitled to appoint one representative on the board of directors of arcop and participate in arcop through its company owned restaurants  but otherwise does not control the decisions and activities of arcop except to ensure that all suppliers satisfy arby s quality control standards 
if arcop does not properly estimate the needs of the arby s system with respect to one or more products  makes poor purchasing decisions  or decides to cease its operations  system sales and operating costs could be adversely affected and the financial condition of arg or the financial condition of arby s franchisees could be hurt 
shortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of perishable food products could damage the arby s brand reputation and adversely affect arg s operating results 
arg and arby s franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of perishable food products that meet arg s specifications 
shortages or interruptions in the supply of perishable food products caused by unanticipated demand  problems in production or distribution  disease or food borne illnesses  inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients  which would likely lower arg s revenues  damage arby s reputation and otherwise harm arg s business 
additional instances of mad cow disease or other food borne illnesses  such as bird flu or salmonella  could adversely affect the price and availability of beef  poultry or other meats and create negative publicity  which could result in a decline in sales 
instances of mad cow disease or other food borne illnesses  such as bird flu  salmonella  e coli or hepatitis a  could adversely affect the price and availability of beef  poultry or other meats  including if additional incidents cause consumers to shift their preferences to other meats 
as a result  arby s restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are additional instances of mad cow disease or other food borne illnesses 
in addition to losses associated with higher prices and a lower supply of our food ingredients  instances of food borne illnesses could result in negative publicity for arby s 
this negative publicity  as well as any other negative publicity concerning food products arby s serves  may reduce demand for arby s food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to arby s restaurants 
a decrease in guest traffic to arby s restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity could result in a decline in sales at company owned restaurants or in arg s royalties from sales at franchised restaurants 
changes in consumer tastes and preferences and in discretionary consumer spending could result in a decline in sales at company owned restaurants and in the royalties that arg receives from franchisees 
the quick service restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes  national  regional and local economic conditions  discretionary spending priorities  demographic trends  traffic patterns and the type  number and location of competing restaurants 
arg s success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
accordingly  arg may experience declines in sales during economic downturns 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending or a decline in family food away from home spending could hurt arg s revenues  results of operations  business and financial condition 
in addition  if company owned and franchised restaurants are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends  arg and arby s franchisees may lose customers and the resulting revenues from company owned restaurants and the royalties that arg receives from its franchisees may decline 
changes in food and supply costs could harm arg s results of operations 
arg s profitability depends in part on its ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs 
any increase in food prices  especially that of beef or chicken  could harm arg s operating results 
while fuel price increases have increased the costs of transportation and distribution generally  arg s commodity prices have largely been unaffected by these distribution cost increases in due to purchase contracts for commodities  which are managed by arcop  that have allowed only limited increases for distribution costs 
as these contracts expire and are replaced in  arg expects to experience more variability in its commodity prices 
in addition  arg is susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of other factors beyond its control  such as weather conditions  food safety concerns  product recalls and government regulations 
for example  increased demand for ethanol as a fuel alternative has increased the cost of corn  which is also used as feed in the production of beef and chicken 
therefore  increases in the cost of corn could increase arg s food costs and harm its operating results 
arg cannot predict whether it will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting its purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could adversely affect arg s operating results 
in addition  arg may not seek to or be able to pass along price increases to its customers 
competition from other restaurant companies could hurt arg 
the market segments in which company owned and franchised arby s restaurants compete are highly competitive with respect to  among other things  price  food quality and presentation  service  location  and the nature and condition of the restaurant facility 
arby s restaurants compete with a variety of locally owned restaurants  as well as competitive regional and national chains and franchises 
several of these chains compete by offering high quality sandwiches and or menu items that are targeted at certain consumer groups 
additionally  many of our competitors have introduced lower cost  value meal menu options 
arg s revenues and those of arby s franchisees may be hurt by this product and price competition 
moreover  new companies  including operators outside the quick service restaurant industry  may enter arby s market areas and target arby s customer base 
for example  additional competitive pressures for prepared food purchases have come from deli sections and in store cafes of several major grocery store chains  as well as from convenience stores and casual dining outlets 
such competitors may have  among other things  lower operating costs  lower debt service requirements  better locations  better facilities  better management  more effective marketing and more efficient operations 
all such competition may adversely affect arg s revenues and profits by reducing revenues of company owned restaurants and royalty payments from franchised restaurants 
many of arg s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than arg  which may allow them to react to changes in pricing and marketing strategies in the quick service restaurant industry better than arg can 
current arby s restaurant locations may become unattractive  and attractive new locations may not be available for a reasonable price  if at all 
the success of any restaurant depends in substantial part on its location 
there can be no assurance that current arby s locations will continue to be attractive as demographic patterns change 
neighborhood or economic conditions where arby s restaurants are located could decline in the future  thus resulting in potentially reduced sales in those locations 
in addition  rising real estate prices  particularly in the northeastern region of the us  may restrict the ability of arg or arby s franchisees to purchase or lease new desirable locations 
if desirable locations cannot be obtained at reasonable prices  arg s ability to effect its growth strategies will be adversely affected 
arg s business could be hurt by increased labor costs or labor shortages 
labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company owned restaurants 
arg devotes significant resources to recruiting and training its managers and hourly employees 
increased labor costs due to competition  increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs or other factors would adversely impact arg s cost of sales and operating expenses 
in addition  arg s success depends on its ability to attract  motivate and retain qualified employees  including restaurant managers and staff 
if arg is unable to do so  its results of operations may be hurt 
arg s leasing and ownership of significant amounts of real estate exposes it to possible liabilities and losses  including liabilities associated with environmental matters 
as of december   arg leased or owned the land and or the building for over  arby s restaurants 
accordingly  arg is subject to all of the risks associated with leasing and owning real estate 
in particular  the value of our real property assets could decrease  and arg s costs could increase  because of changes in the investment climate for real estate  demographic trends  supply or demand for the use of the restaurants  which may result from competition from similar restaurants in the area  and liability for environmental matters 
arg is subject to federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations concerning the discharge  storage  handling  release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances 
these environmental laws provide for significant fines  penalties and liabilities  sometimes without regard to whether the owner  operator or occupant of the property knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
third parties may also make claims against owners  operators or occupants of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of  or actual or alleged exposure to  such substances 
a number of arg s restaurant sites were formerly gas stations or are adjacent to current or former gas stations  or were used for other commercial activities that can create environmental impacts 
arg may also acquire or lease these types of sites in the future 
arg has not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of all of its properties 
arg may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at its leased and owned properties  and any such liabilities identified in the future could cause arg to incur significant costs  including costs associated with litigation  fines or clean up responsibilities 
arg leases real property generally for initial terms of years 
many leases provide that the landlord may increase the rent over the term of the lease 
most leases require arg to pay all of the costs of insurance  taxes  maintenance and utilities 
arg generally cannot cancel these leases 
if an existing or future restaurant is not profitable  and arg decides to close it  arg may nonetheless be committed to perform its obligations under the applicable lease including  among other things  paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
in addition  as each of arg s leases expires  arg may fail to negotiate renewals  either on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could cause arg to close stores in desirable locations 
complaints or litigation may hurt arg 
occasionally  arg s customers file complaints or lawsuits against it alleging that arg is responsible for an illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to an arby s restaurant  or alleging that there was a problem with food quality or operations at an arby s restaurant 
arg is also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including personal injury claims  contract claims  claims from franchisees and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters 
arg could also become subject to class action lawsuits related to these matters in the future 
regardless of whether any claims against arg are valid or whether arg is found to be liable  claims may be expensive to defend and may divert management s attention away from operations and hurt arg s performance 
a judgment significantly in excess of arg s insurance coverage for any claims could materially adversely affect arg s financial condition or results of operations 
further  adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may hurt arg and arby s franchisees 
additionally  the restaurant industry has been subject to a number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers 
adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm the reputation of arby s restaurants  even if the allegations are not directed against arby s restaurants or are not valid  and even if arg is not found liable or the concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants 
moreover  complaints  litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of arby s franchisees could also hurt arg s business as a whole 
arg s current insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims it may file 
arg currently maintains insurance customary for businesses of its size and type 
however  there are types of losses it may incur that cannot be insured against or that arg believes are not economically reasonable to insure  such as losses due to natural disasters or acts of terrorism 
in addition  arg currently self insures a significant portion of expected losses under its workers compensation  general liability and property insurance programs 
unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying arg s reserves for these losses could result in materially different amounts of expense under these programs  which could harm arg s business and adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
changes in governmental regulation may hurt arg s ability to open new restaurants or otherwise hurt arg s existing and future operations and results 
each arby s restaurant is subject to licensing and regulation by health  sanitation  safety and other agencies in the state and or municipality in which the restaurant is located 
there can be no assurance that arg and or arby s franchisees will not experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new restaurants  which could delay the opening of such restaurants in the future 
in addition  more stringent and varied requirements of local and tax governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new restaurants in particular locations 
arg  and arby s franchisees  are also subject to the fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the ada  family leave mandates and a variety of other laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters 
as described more fully under item legal proceedings  one of our subsidiaries was a defendant in a lawsuit alleging failure to comply with title iii of the ada at approximately company owned restaurants acquired as part of the rtm acquisition in july under a court approved settlement of that lawsuit  arg estimates that it will spend approximately million per year of capital expenditures over an eight year period beginning in to bring these restaurants into compliance with the ada  in addition to paying certain legal fees and expenses 
arg cannot predict the amount of any other future expenditures that may be required in order to permit company owned restaurants to comply with any changes in existing regulations or to comply with any future regulations that may become applicable to arg s business 
arg s operations could be influenced by weather conditions 
weather  which is unpredictable  can impact arby s restaurant sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for arby s restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm in the northeast or midwest or a hurricane in the southeast can shut down an entire metropolitan area  resulting in a reduction in sales in that area 
our first quarter includes winter months and historically has a lower level of sales at company owned restaurants 
because a significant portion of arg s restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi fixed in nature  the loss of sales during these periods hurts arg s operating margins  and can result in restaurant operating losses 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison may not be a good indication of arg s performance or how it may perform in the future 
due to the concentration of arby s restaurants in particular geographic regions  arg s business results could be impacted by the adverse economic conditions prevailing in those regions regardless of the state of the national economy as a whole 
as of december  arg and arby s franchisees operated arby s restaurants in states  the district of columbia and four foreign countries 
as of december   the six leading states by number of operating units were ohio  with restaurants  michigan  with restaurants  indiana  with restaurants  florida  with restaurants  texas  with restaurants  and georgia  with restaurants 
this geographic concentration can cause economic conditions in particular areas of the country to have a disproportionate impact on arg s overall results of operations 
arg believes that the adverse economic conditions in ohio and michigan  two states that have a significant number of arby s restaurants  have adversely impacted its results of operations 
it is possible that adverse economic conditions in those two states or in other states or regions that contain a high concentration of arby s restaurants could have a material adverse impact on arg s results of operations in the future 
arg and its subsidiaries are subject to various restrictions  and substantially all of their assets are pledged  under a credit agreement 
under its credit agreement  substantially all of the assets of arg and its subsidiaries other than real property are pledged as collateral security 
the credit agreement also contains financial covenants that  among other things  require arg and its subsidiaries to maintain certain financial ratios and restrict their ability to incur debt  pay dividends or make other distributions  enter into certain fundamental transactions including sales of assets and certain mergers and consolidations and create or permit liens 
if arg and its subsidiaries are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments of interest or principal under  or are unable to comply with covenants of  the credit agreement  they would be in default under the terms of the credit agreement  which would  under certain circumstances  permit the lenders to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness

risks related to deerfield dcm may lose client assets  and thus fee revenue  for various reasons 
dcm s success depends on its ability to earn investment advisory fees from the client accounts it manages 
such fees generally consist of payments based on the amount of assets in the account management fees  and on the profits earned by the account or the returns to certain investors in the accounts performance fees 
if there is a reduction in an account s assets  there will be a corresponding reduction in dcm s management fees from the account  and a likely reduction in dcm s performance fees if any relating to the account  since the smaller the account s asset base the smaller will be the potential profits earned by the account 
there could be a reduction in an account s assets as the result of investment losses in the account  the withdrawal by investors of their capital in the account  or both 
except for the reit  investors in the accounts managed by dcm have various types of withdrawal rights  ranging from the right of investors in separate accounts to withdraw any or all of their capital on a daily basis  the right of investors in hedge funds to withdraw their capital on a monthly or quarterly basis  and the right of investors in cdos to terminate the cdo in specified situations 
investors in hedge funds and managed accounts might withdraw capital for many reasons  including their dissatisfaction with the account s performance  adverse publicity regarding dcm  dcm s loss of key personnel  errors in reporting to investors account values or account performance  other matters resulting from problems in dcm s systems technology  investors desire to invest the capital elsewhere  and their need in the case of investors that are themselves investment funds for the capital to fund withdrawals by their investors 
dcm could experience a major loss of account assets  and thus advisory fee revenue  at any time 
poor investment performance could lead to a loss of clients and a decline in dcm s revenues 
investment performance is a key factor for the retention of client assets  the growth of dcm s assets under management and the generation of management fee revenue 
poor investment performance could impair dcm s revenues and growth because existing clients might withdraw funds in favor of better performing products  which would result in lower investment management fees for dcm  dcm s subordinate management fees for a cdo may be deferred  dcm s ability to attract funds from existing and new clients might diminish  and dcm might earn minimal or no performance fees 
the failure of dcm s investment products to perform well both on an absolute basis and in relation to competing products  therefore  could have a material adverse effect on dcm s business 
dcm derives a substantial portion of its revenues from contracts that may be terminated on short notice 
dcm derives a substantial portion of its revenues from investment management agreements with accounts that generally have the right to remove dcm as the investment manager of the account and replace it with a substitute investment manager 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated for various reasons  including failure to follow the account s investment guidelines  fraud  breach of fiduciary duty and gross negligence  or may not be renewed 
with respect to dcm s agreements with some of the cdos it manages  dcm can be removed without cause by investors that hold a specified amount of the securities issued by the cdo 
all of dcm s agreements with cdos allow investors that hold a specified amount of securities issued by the cdo to remove dcm for cause  which typically includes dcm s violation of the management agreement or the cdo s indenture  dcm s breach of its representations and warranties under the agreement  dcm s bankruptcy or insolvency  dcm s fraud or a criminal offense by dcm or its employees  and the failure of certain of the cdo s performance tests 
with respect to dcm s investment management agreement with the reit  at the end of the initial term of the agreement which occurs on december  or at the end of any one year renewal term thereafter  dcm can be removed as manager by a vote of at least two thirds of the reit s independent directors or holders of at least a majority of the outstanding common stock of the reit based upon unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to the reit or a determination that the management fees payable to dcm are not fair subject to dcm s right to prevent such a termination by accepting a reduction of management fees that at least two thirds of the reit s independent directors determine to be fair 
during  dcm generated approximately of its revenue from managing the reit 
dcm s investment management agreements with separate accounts are typically terminable by the client without penalty on days notice or less 
dcm may not be able to replace these agreements on favorable terms 
the revenue loss that would result from any such termination could have a material adverse effect on dcm s business 
dcm could lose client assets as the result of the loss of key dcm personnel 
dcm generally assigns the management of its investment products to specific teams  consisting of dcm portfolio management and other personnel 
the loss of a particular member or members of such a team for example  because of resignation or retirement could cause investors in the product to withdraw  to the extent they have withdrawal rights  all or a portion of their investment in the product  and adversely affect the marketing of the product to new investors and the product s performance 
in the case of some accounts  such as certain cdos  dcm can be removed as investment manager upon its loss of specified key employees 
in addition to the loss of specific portfolio management team members  the loss of one or more members of dcm s senior management involved in supervising the portfolio teams could have similar adverse effects on dcm s investment products 
dcm may need to offer new investment strategies and products in order to continue to generate revenue 
the segments of the asset management industry in which dcm operates are subject to rapid change 
investment strategies and products that had historically been attractive to investors may lose their appeal for various reasons 
thus  strategies and products that have generated fee revenue for dcm in the past may fail to do so in the future 
in such case dcm would have to develop new strategies and products in order to retain investors or replace withdrawing investors with new investors 
it could be both expensive and difficult for dcm to develop new strategies and products  and there is no assurance that dcm would be successful in this regard 
in addition  alternative asset management products represent a substantially smaller segment of the overall asset management industry than traditional asset management products such as many corporate bond funds 
dcm s inability to expand its offerings beyond alternative asset management products could inhibit its growth and harm its competitive position in the investment management industry 
changes in the fixed income markets could adversely affect dcm 
dcm s success depends largely on the attractiveness to institutional investors of investing in the fixed income markets  and changes in those markets could significantly reduce the appeal of dcm s investment products to such investors 
such changes could include increased volatility in the prices of fixed income instruments  periods of illiquidity in the fixed income trading markets  changes in the taxation of fixed income instruments  significant changes in the spreads in the fixed income markets the amount by which the yields on particular fixed income instruments exceed the yields on benchmark us treasury securities  and the lack of arbitrage opportunities between us treasury securities and their related instruments such as interest rate swap and futures contracts 
the fixed income markets can be highly volatile  and the prices of fixed income instruments may increase or decrease for many reasons beyond dcm s control or ability to anticipate  including economic and political events and acts of terrorism 
any adverse changes in the fixed income markets could reduce dcm s revenues 
the narrowing of cdo spreads could make it difficult for dcm to launch new cdos 
it is important for dcm to be able to launch new cdo products from time to time  both to expand its cdo activities which are a major part of dcm s business and to replace existing cdos as they are terminated or mature 
the ability to launch new cdos is dependent on  among other factors  the amount by which the interest earned on the collateral held by the cdo such as bank loans or corporate bonds exceeds the interest payable by the cdo on the debt obligations it issues to investors 
if these spreads are not wide enough  the proposed cdo will not be attractive to investors and thus cannot be launched 
there may be sustained periods when such spreads will not be sufficient for dcm to launch new cdo products  which could have a material adverse effect on dcm s business 
dcm could lose client assets as the result of adverse publicity 
asset managers such as dcm can be particularly vulnerable to losing clients because of adverse publicity 
asset managers are generally regarded as fiduciaries  and if they fail to adhere at all times to a high level of honesty  fair dealing and professionalism they can incur large and rapid losses of client assets 
accordingly  a relatively small lapse in this regard  particularly if it resulted in a regulatory investigation or enforcement proceeding  could materially hurt dcm s business 
dcm could incur losses due to trading errors 
dcm could make errors in placing transaction orders for client accounts  such as purchasing a security for an account whose investment guidelines prohibited the account from holding the security  purchasing an unintended amount of the security  or placing a buy order when dcm intended to place a sell order 
if the transaction resulted in a loss for the account  dcm might be required to reimburse the account for the loss  or dcm might choose to do so for client relations purposes 
such reimbursements could be substantial 
dcm could lose management fee income from its cdos because of payment defaults by issuers of collateral held by the cdos or the triggering of certain structural protections built into cdos 
pursuant to the investment management agreements between dcm and the cdos it manages  dcm s management fee from the cdo is generally subject to a waterfall structure  under which dcm will not receive all or a portion of its fees if  among other things  the cdo does not have sufficient cash flows from its underlying collateral such as corporate bonds or bank loans to pay the required interest on the notes it has issued to investors and certain expenses 
this could occur if there are defaults by issuers of the collateral on their payments of principal or interest relating to the collateral 
in that event  dcm s management fees would be deferred until funds are available to pay the fees  if such funds become available 
in addition  many cdos have structural provisions meant to protect investors from deterioration in the credit quality of the underlying collateral pool 
if those provisions are triggered  then certain portions of dcm s management fees may be deferred indefinitely 
dcm may be unable to increase its assets under management in certain of its investment vehicles  or it may have to reduce such assets  because of capacity constraints 
a number of dcm s investment vehicles are limited in the amount of client assets they can accommodate by the amount of liquidity in the instruments traded by such vehicles  the arbitrage opportunities available in those instruments  or other factors 
thus  dcm may manage investment vehicles that are relatively successful but that cannot accept additional capital because of such constraints 
in addition  dcm might have to reduce the amount of assets managed in investment vehicles that face capacity constraints 
changes in the fixed income markets could materially reduce capacity  such as an increase in the number of asset managers using the same or similar strategies as dcm 
the fixed income investment management market is highly competitive and dcm may lose client assets due to competition from other asset managers who have greater resources than dcm does or who are able to offer services and products at more competitive prices 
the alternative asset management industry is highly competitive 
many firms offer similar and additional investment management products and services to the same clients that dcm targets 
dcm currently focuses almost exclusively on fixed income securities and related financial instruments in managing client accounts 
dcm has limited experience in investing in equity securities 
this is in contrast to numerous other asset managers with comparable assets under management  which have significant background and experience in both the equity and debt markets 
in addition  many of dcm s competitors have or may in the future develop greater financial and other resources  more extensive distribution capabilities  more effective marketing strategies  more attractive fund structures and broader name recognition 
dcm s competitors may be able to use these resources and capabilities to place dcm at a competitive disadvantage in retaining assets under management and achieving increased market penetration 
also  dcm may be at a disadvantage in competing with other asset managers that are subject to less regulation and thus less restricted in their client solicitation and portfolio management activities  and dcm may be competing for non us clients with asset managers that are based in the jurisdiction of the prospective client s domicile 
because barriers to entry into the alternative asset management business are low  dcm may face increased competition from many new entrants into dcm s relatively limited market of providing fixed income asset management services to institutional clients 
also  dcm is a relatively recent entrant into the reit management business and dcm competes in this area against numerous firms that are larger  more experienced or both 
additionally  if other asset managers offer services and products at more competitive prices than dcm offers  dcm may not be able to maintain its current fee structure 
although dcm s investment management fees vary from product to product  historically dcm has competed primarily on the performance of its products and not on the level of its investment management fees relative to those of its competitors 
in recent years  however  despite the fact that alternative asset managers typically charge higher fees than traditional managers  particularly with respect to hedge funds and similar products  there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry generally 
in order to maintain its fee structure in a competitive environment  dcm must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay dcm s fees 
dcm cannot assure you that it will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow dcm to maintain its current fee structure 
fee reductions on existing or future business could have a material adverse effect on dcm s profit margins and results of operations 
changes in laws  regulations or government policies affecting dcm s businesses could limit its revenues  increase its costs of doing business and materially and adversely affect its business 
dcm s business is subject to extensive government regulation 
this regulation is primarily at the federal level  through regulation by the sec under the investment advisers act of  as amended  and regulation by the commodity futures trading commission  or cftc  under the commodity exchange act  as amended 
dcm is also regulated by state regulators 
the investment advisers act imposes numerous obligations on investment advisers including anti fraud prohibitions  advertising and custody requirements  disclosure obligations  compliance program duties and trading restrictions 
the cftc regulates commodity futures and option markets and imposes numerous obligations on the industry 
dcm is registered with the cftc as both a commodity trading advisor and a commodity pool operator and certain of its employees are registered with the cftc as associated persons 
dcm is also a member of the national futures association  the self regulatory organization for the us commodity futures industry  and thus subject to its regulations 
if dcm fails to comply with applicable laws or regulations  dcm could be subject to fines  censure  suspensions of personnel or other sanctions  including revocation of its registration as an investment adviser  commodity trading advisor or commodity pool operator 
changes in laws  regulations or government policies could limit dcm s revenues  increase its costs of doing business and materially adversely affect its business 
dcm europe s business is subject to extensive government regulation  primarily by the united kingdom financial services authority under the uk financial services and markets act of such regulation is generally similar to the regulation governing dcm 
the non us domiciled investment funds that dcm manages are regulated in the jurisdiction of their domicile 
changes in the laws or government policies of these foreign jurisdictions could limit dcm s revenues from these funds  increase dcm s costs of doing business in these jurisdictions and materially adversely affect dcm s business 
the level of investor participation in dcm s products may also be affected by the regulatory and self regulatory requirements and restrictions applicable to dcm s products and investors  the financial reporting requirements imposed on dcm s investors and financial intermediaries  and the tax treatment of dcm s products 
adverse changes in any of these areas may result in a loss of existing investors or difficulties in attracting new investors 
other risks we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brands and hurt our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights  service marks  trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our brands and other intellectual property 
the success of our business strategy depends  in part  on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both existing and new markets 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate  or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  either in print or on the internet  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  including the failure of our brands to achieve and maintain market acceptance 
this could harm our image  brand or competitive position and  if we commence litigation to enforce our rights  cause us to incur significant legal fees 
we franchise our restaurant brands to various franchisees 
while we try to ensure that the quality of our brands is maintained by all of our franchisees  we cannot assure you that these franchisees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property or the reputation of the arby s restaurant system 
we have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
the trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the united states in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries 
we cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the united states and foreign countries will be adequate 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
in addition  we cannot assure you that third parties will not claim infringement by us in the future 
any such claim  whether or not it has merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause delays in introducing new menu items or investment products or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
as a result  any such claim could harm our business and cause a decline in our results of operations and financial condition 
one of our subsidiaries remains contingently liable with respect to certain obligations relating to a business that we have sold 
in july  we sold of our then remaining interest in national propane partners  lp and a sub partnership  national propane  lp to columbia energy group  and retained less than a special limited partner interest in amerigas eagle propane  lp formerly known as national propane  lp and as columbia propane  lp as part of the transaction  our subsidiary  national propane corporation  agreed that while it remains a special limited partner of amerigas  it would indemnify the owner of amerigas for any payments the owner makes under certain debt of amerigas aggregating approximately million as of december   if amerigas is unable to repay or refinance such debt  but only after recourse to the assets of amerigas 
either national propane corporation or amerigas propane  lp  the owner of amerigas  may require amerigas to repurchase the special limited partner interest 
however  we believe it is unlikely that either party would require repurchase prior to as either amerigas propane  lp would owe us tax indemnification payments or we would accelerate payment of deferred taxes  which amount to approximately million as of december   associated with our sale of the propane business 
although we believe that it is unlikely that we will be called upon to make any payments under the indemnification described above  if we are required to make such payments it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
in  a number of class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of our stockholders in the court of chancery of the state of delaware in and for new castle county 
each of these actions named triarc  messrs 
peltz and may and the other then directors of triarc as defendants 
in  certain plaintiffs in these actions filed a consolidated amended complaint alleging that our tender offer statement filed with the sec in  pursuant to which we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock  failed to disclose material information 
the amended complaint sought  among other relief  monetary damages in an unspecified amount 
in  the plaintiffs agreed to stay this action pending determination of a related stockholder action that was subsequently dismissed in october and is no longer being appealed 
on october   plaintiffs filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the action as moot  but to retain jurisdiction for the limited purpose of considering a subsequent application by plaintiffs for legal fees and expenses 
the plaintiffs motion to dismiss the action as moot was granted on october  on december   plaintiffs filed a motion seeking  in fees and  for reimbursement of expenses 
on february   defendants filed papers in opposition to plaintiffs motion 
on march   the court entered an order awarding plaintiffs  in fees and expenses 
on april   defendants filed a notice of appeal 
on june   the parties entered into an agreement pursuant to which  among other things  triarc paid the  of fees and expenses awarded by the court and the defendants withdrew their appeal 
in november  access now  inc and edward resnick  later replaced by christ soter tavantzis  on their own behalf and on the behalf of all those similarly situated  brought an action in the united states district court for the southern district of florida against rtm operating company rtm  which became a subsidiary of ours following our acquisition of the rtm restaurant group in july the complaint alleged that the approximately arby s restaurants owned by rtm and its affiliates failed to comply with title iii of the ada 
the plaintiffs requested class certification and injunctive relief requiring rtm and such affiliates to comply with the ada in all of their restaurants 
the complaint did not seek monetary damages  but did seek attorneys fees 
without admitting liability  rtm entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs on a class wide basis  which was approved by the court on august  the settlement agreement calls for the restaurants owned by rtm and certain of its affiliates to be brought into ada compliance over an eight year period at a rate of approximately restaurants per year 
the settlement agreement also applies to restaurants subsequently acquired by rtm and such affiliates 
arg estimates that it will spend approximately million per year of capital expenditures over an eight year period beginning in to bring the restaurants into compliance under the settlement agreement  in addition to paying certain legal fees and expenses 
in addition to the legal matters described above and the environmental matter described under item business general environmental matters  we are involved in other litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses 
we and our subsidiaries have reserves for all of our legal and environmental matters aggregating million as of december  although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and some of these matters may be disposed of unfavorably to us  based on our currently available information  including legal defenses available to us and or our subsidiaries  and given the aforementioned reserves  we do not believe that the outcome of these legal and environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

although we currently intend to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends  there can be no assurance that any additional regular quarterly cash dividends will be declared or paid or the amount or timing of such dividends  if any 
any future dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on such factors as our earnings  financial condition  cash requirements and other factors 
we have no class of equity securities currently issued and outstanding except for our class a common stock and class b common stock  series however  we are currently authorized to issue up to million shares of preferred stock 
because we are a holding company  our ability to meet our cash requirements  including required interest and principal payments on our indebtedness  is primarily dependent upon our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  cash flows from our subsidiaries  including loans  cash dividends and reimbursement by subsidiaries to us in connection with providing certain management services  and payments by subsidiaries under certain tax sharing agreements

the ability of any of our subsidiaries to pay cash dividends or make any loans or advances to us is also dependent upon the respective abilities of such entities to achieve sufficient cash flows after satisfying their respective cash requirements  including debt service  to enable the payment of such dividends or the making of such loans or advances

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of triarc companies  inc  which we refer to as triarc  and its subsidiaries should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
certain statements we make under this item constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements and projections in part i preceding item introduction and executive overview we currently operate in two business segments 
we operate in the restaurant business through our franchised and company owned arby s restaurants and  effective with the july acquisition of deerfield company llc  which we refer to as deerfield  in the asset management business 
on july  we completed the acquisition of a capital interest in deerfield  in a transaction we refer to as the deerfield acquisition 
deerfield  through its wholly owned subsidiary deerfield capital management llc  is an asset manager offering a diverse range of fixed income and credit related strategies to institutional investors 
deerfield provides asset management services for investors through collateralized debt obligation vehicles  which we refer to as cdos  and investment funds and private investment accounts  which we refer to as funds  including deerfield triarc capital corp  a real estate investment trust formed in december  which we refer to as the reit 
deerfield s results of operations  less applicable minority interests  and cash flows are included in our consolidated results subsequent to the july  date of the deerfield acquisition and our and consolidated results for the full years 
see below under presentation of financial information 
on july  we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the equity interests or the assets of the entities comprising the rtm restaurant group  arby s largest franchisee with arby s restaurants in states as of that date  in a transaction we refer to as the rtm acquisition 
accordingly  rtm s results of operations and cash flows are included in our consolidated results subsequent to the july  date of the rtm acquisition and are included in our consolidated results for the full year 
commencing on july   royalties and franchise and related fees from rtm are eliminated in consolidation 
in our restaurant business  we derive revenues in the form of royalties and franchise and related fees and from sales by our company owned restaurants 
while of our existing arby s royalty agreements and all of our new domestic royalty agreements provide for royalties of of franchise revenues  our average royalty rate was for the year ended december  in our asset management business  we derive revenues in the form of asset management and related fees from our management of cdos  funds and the reit  and we may expand the types of investments that we offer and manage 
we derive investment income principally from the investment of our excess cash 
in that regard  we invested in several funds managed by deerfield  including deerfield opportunities fund  llc  which we refer to as the opportunities fund  and dm fund llc  which we refer to as the dm fund 
we invested million in the opportunities fund in october we invested million in the dm fund in march through a partial transfer from our investment in the opportunities fund 
we redeemed our investments in the opportunities fund and the dm fund effective september  and december   respectively 
the opportunities fund through september   and the dm fund through december   were accounted for as consolidated subsidiaries of ours  with minority interests to the extent of participation by investors other than us 
the opportunities fund was a multi strategy hedge fund that principally invested in various fixed income securities and their derivatives and employed substantial leverage in its trading activities which significantly impacted our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
we also have an investment in the reit which is managed by deerfield 
when we refer to deerfield  we mean only deerfield company  llc and not the opportunities fund  the dm fund or the reit 
our goal is to enhance the value of our company by increasing the revenues of the arby s restaurant business and deerfield s asset management business 
we are continuing to focus on growing the number of restaurants in the arby s system  adding new menu offerings and implementing operational initiatives targeted at improving service levels and convenience 
we continue to grow deerfield s assets under management by utilizing the value of its historically profitable investment advisory brand and increasing the types of assets under management  thereby increasing deerfield s asset management fee revenues 
we are continuing to explore a possible corporate restructuring involving our asset management business and other non restaurant net assets 
see liquidity and capital resources potential corporate restructuring for a detailed discussion of the potential corporate restructuring and certain potential impacts thereof on our results of operations and our liquidity and capital resources 
in recent years our restaurant business has experienced the following trends growing us adult population  our principal customer demographic  addition of selected higher priced quality items to menus  which appeal more to adult tastes  increased consumer preference for premium sandwiches with perceived higher levels of freshness  quality and customization along with increased competition in the premium sandwich category which has constrained the pricing of these products  increased price competition  as evidenced by value menu concepts  which offer comparatively lower prices on some menu items  combination meal concepts  which offer a complete meal at an aggregate price lower than the price of the individual food and beverage items  the use of coupons and other price discounting and many recent product promotions focused on the lower prices of certain menu items  increased competition among quick service restaurant competitors and other businesses for available development sites  higher development costs associated with those sites and higher borrowing costs in the lending markets typically used to finance new unit development  increased availability to consumers of new product choices  including additional healthy products focused on freshness driven by a greater consumer awareness of nutritional issues as well as new products that tend to include larger portion sizes and more ingredients  and a wider variety of snack products and non carbonated beverages  competitive pressures from operators outside the quick service restaurant industry  such as the deli sections and in store cafes of several major grocery store chains  convenience stores and casual dining outlets offering prepared food purchases  higher fuel prices  although moderating in recent months  which cause a decrease in many consumers discretionary income  increase our utility costs and are likely to increase the cost of commodities we purchase following the expiration in of our current distribution contracts which contain limits on distribution cost increases  extended hours of operation by many quick service restaurants including both breakfast and late night hours  federal  state and local legislative activity  such as minimum wage increases  mandated health and welfare benefits and restrictions on the use in prepared foods of certain unhealthy fatty acids  commonly referred to as trans fats  which could continue to result in increased wages and related fringe benefits  including health care and other insurance costs  higher packaging costs and higher food costs  competitive pressures from an increasing number of franchise opportunities seeking to attract qualified franchisees  and economically weak conditions in the michigan and ohio regions where a disproportionate number of our company owned restaurants are located 
we experience the effects of these trends directly to the extent they affect the operations of our company owned restaurants and indirectly to the extent they affect sales by our franchisees and  accordingly  the royalties and franchise fees we receive from them 
in recent years  our asset management business has experienced the following trends growth in the hedge fund market as investors appear to have increased their investment allocations to hedge funds  with particular interest recently in hedge strategies that focus on specific areas of growth in domestic and foreign economies such as oil  commodities  interest rates  equities and other specific areas  although such growth has moderated somewhat recently reflecting the recent performance of certain funds and the competitive market  increased demand for securities  partly due to an increase in the number of hedge funds  resulting in higher purchase prices of certain securities and  during periods of asset liquidation by those hedge funds  potentially lower sales prices  which can negatively impact our returns  short term interest rates continue to increase more significantly than long term interest rates  representing a flatter yield curve  resulting in higher funding costs for our securities purchases  which can negatively impact our margins within our managed funds  potentially lowering our asset management fees and assets under management  and increased merger and acquisition activity  resulting in additional risks and opportunities in the credit markets 
presentation of financial information we report on a fiscal year consisting of or weeks ending on the sunday closest to december however  deerfield  the opportunities fund and dm fund report or reported on a calendar year ending on december our fiscal year contained weeks and each of our and fiscal years contained weeks 
in this discussion  we refer to the additional week in as the rd week in our fiscal year commenced on december  and ended on january  except that for this period  deerfield and the opportunities fund are included commencing july  and october   respectively  through their calendar year end of december  our fiscal year commenced on january  and ended on january  except that a rtm is included commencing july  and b deerfield  the opportunities fund and  commencing march   the dm fund are included on a calendar year basis 
our fiscal year commenced on january  and ended on december  except that a deerfield and the dm fund are included on a calendar year basis and b the opportunities fund is included from january  through its september  redemption date 
all references to years relate to fiscal years rather than calendar years  except for deerfield  the opportunities fund and the dm fund 
results of operations presented below is a table that summarizes our results of operations and compares the amount of the change between and  which we refer to as the change  and and  which we refer to as the change 
change change in millions revenues net sales royalties and franchise and related fees asset management and related fees costs and expenses cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization cost of services  excluding depreciation and amortization advertising and promotions general and administrative  excluding depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs facilities relocation and corporate restructuring loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights operating profit loss interest expense insurance expense related to long term debt loss on early extinguishments of debt investment income  net gain on sale of unconsolidated businesses other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests provision for benefit from income taxes minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes loss from operations gain on disposal income loss from discontinued operations net income loss compared with net sales our net sales  which were generated entirely from our company owned restaurants  increased million to  million for from million for  primarily due to the effect of including rtm in our results for all of but only for the portion of following the july  acquisition date 
in addition  net sales were favorably affected by net company owned restaurants added during same store sales of our company owned restaurants increased one percent in when we refer to same store sales  we mean only sales of those restaurants which were open during the same months in both of the comparable periods 
same store sales of our company owned restaurants were positively impacted by our marketing initiatives  including value oriented menu offerings  an enhanced menu board design and new promotions  the launch in march of arby s chicken naturals  a line of menu offerings made with percent all natural chicken breast and selective price increases implemented in november partially offsetting these positive factors was the effect of higher fuel prices on consumers discretionary income which we believe had a negative impact on our sales beginning in the second half of  although the effect moderated in the second half of same store sales growth of our company owned restaurants was less than the same store sales growth of our franchised restaurants discussed below primarily due to the introduction and use throughout of local marketing initiatives by our franchisees similar to those initiatives which we were already using for company owned restaurants in  including more effective local television advertising and increased couponing  and the disproportionate number of company owned restaurants in the economically weaker michigan and ohio regions which continue to underperform the system 
we currently anticipate positive same store sales growth for of both company owned and franchised restaurants  although not necessarily in the first quarter and despite the weak economy in michigan and ohio  driven by the anticipated performance of various initiatives such as a value program which offers a flexible combination of selected menu items for a discounted price  planned additions of new limited time menu items  the full year effect of the selective price increases that were implemented in november and new product introductions 
in addition to the anticipated positive effect of same store sales growth  net sales should also be positively impacted by an increase in company owned restaurants 
we presently plan to open approximately new company owned restaurants in we continually review the performance of any underperforming company owned restaurants and evaluate whether to close those restaurants  particularly in connection with the decision to renew or extend their leases 
specifically  we have restaurant leases that are scheduled for renewal or expiration during we currently anticipate the renewal or extension of all but approximately of those leases 
royalties and franchise and related fees our royalties and franchise and related fees  which were generated entirely from the franchised restaurants  decreased million to million for from million for  reflecting million of royalties and franchise and related fees from rtm recognized in for the period prior to the rtm acquisition whereas royalties and franchise and related fees from rtm are eliminated in consolidation for the full year of aside from the effect of the rtm acquisition  royalties and franchise and related fees increased million in  reflecting a million improvement in royalties due to a increase in same store sales of the franchised restaurants in as compared with  a million net increase in royalties from the franchised restaurants opened in  with generally higher than average sales volumes  and the restaurants sold to franchisees in replacing the royalties from the generally underperforming restaurants closed and the elimination of royalties from restaurants we acquired from franchisees in and a million increase in franchise and related fees 
the increase in same store sales of the franchised restaurants reflects the factors affecting same store sales of our company owned restaurants as well as the additional factors affecting the franchised restaurants compared with our company owned restaurants discussed above under net sales 
we expect that our royalties and franchise and related fees will increase during as compared with  although not necessarily in the first quarter  due to anticipated positive same store sales growth of franchised restaurants from the expected performance of the various initiatives described above under net sales and the positive effect of net new restaurant openings by our franchisees 
asset management and related fees our asset management and related fees  which were generated entirely from the management of cdos and funds by deerfield  increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase reflects a million increase in incentive fees from funds other than the reit  principally related to one of the funds which experienced improved performance  including the impact of higher assets under management  million in management and related fees from new cdos and funds  a million increase in management and incentive fees from the reit principally reflecting the full year effect in of a million increase in assets under management for the reit resulting from an initial public stock offering in june  a million increase in incentive fees from cdos principally due to the recognition of contingent fees upon the early termination of a particular cdo and a million increase in management fees principally reflecting higher assets under management of previously existing cdos and funds other than the reit 
assets under management for the reit were million as of september   upon which we receive a per annum management fee and a quarterly incentive fee if a specified rate of return is met 
incentive fees are based upon the performance of the funds and cdos and  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  are recognized when the amounts become fixed and determinable upon the close of a performance period for the funds and the achievement of performance targets for the cdos 
we expect that our asset management and related fees will increase during as compared with due to anticipated growth in assets under management from our existing funds and the addition of new cdos and funds planned for cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization our cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization resulted entirely from the company owned restaurants 
cost of sales increased million to million for from million for  resulting in a gross margin of for each year 
we define gross margin as the difference between net sales and cost of sales divided by net sales 
the increase in cost of sales is primarily attributable to the full year effect in of the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition and the effect of the net restaurants added in our overall gross margin was positively affected by the inclusion of restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition with their higher gross margins for the full year compared with only the portion of following the july  acquisition date  our continuing implementation of the more effective operational procedures of the rtm restaurants at the restaurants we owned prior to the rtm acquisition  increased beverage rebates resulting from the agreement for pepsi beverage products effective january  and decreases in our cost of beef 
these positive effects were substantially offset by the effect of increased price discounting principally in the second half of associated with our value oriented menu offerings 
the gross margin for the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition was significantly higher than that of the restaurants we owned prior to the rtm acquisition principally due to rtm s more effective operational procedures as well as higher average unit sales volumes which result in more favorable cost leverage 
we anticipate that our gross margin in will be relatively consistent with as a result of the positive effects of our continuing implementation of the more efficient operational procedures of rtm throughout our other company owned restaurants  cost savings from certain new commodity supply contracts negotiated by our purchasing cooperative and the full year effect on our net sales of the selective price increases that were implemented in november  all of which will be substantially offset by the effects of our continued use of value oriented menu offerings  anticipated cost increases as new distribution contracts are entered into in early reflecting the effects of higher fuel costs and our efforts to eliminate non naturally occurring trans fats from our products 
cost of services  excluding depreciation and amortization our cost of services  excluding depreciation and amortization  which resulted entirely from the management of cdos and funds by deerfield  increased million  or  to million for from million for principally due to the hiring of additional personnel to support our current and anticipated growth in assets under management and increased incentive compensation levels 
we expect that our cost of services will increase in as compared with in proportion with the anticipated growth in asset management and related fees discussed above 
the increased cost of services will reflect additional headcount planned for in addition to the full year impact of the personnel hired during as well as related incentive compensation 
our royalties and franchise and related fees have no associated cost of services 
advertising and promotions our advertising and promotions expenses consist of third party costs for local and national television  radio  direct mail and outdoor advertising as well as point of purchase materials and local restaurant marketing 
these expenses increased million principally due to the full year effect on advertising and promotions in of the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition 
however  advertising and promotions expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased slightly from in to in general and administrative  excluding depreciation and amortization our general and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization increased million  reflecting a million increase in general and administrative expenses of our restaurant segment principally relating to the full year effect of the rtm acquisition on such increase in our restaurant segment reflects a million increase in salaries and incentive compensation as a result of increased headcount due to the rtm acquisition and the strengthening of the infrastructure of our restaurant segment  a million increase in fringe benefits  recruiting  travel  training and other employee related costs resulting from the increased headcount  a million increase in costs related to outside consultants that we utilized to assist with the integration of rtm  including compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and the integration of computer systems  a million increase in severance and related charges of which million was in connection with the replacement of three senior restaurant executives during our second quarter and a million increase in employee share based compensation resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment  which we refer to as sfas r  which we adopted effective january  see discussion in following paragraphs 
aside from the increase attributable to our restaurant segment  general and administrative expenses decreased million primarily due to an million decrease in share based compensation see the discussion in the following paragraphs  a million increase in the reimbursement of our expenses by a management company  which we refer to as the management company  formed by our chairman and chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  whom we refer to as the executives  and our vice chairman  all of whom we refer to as the principals  for the allocable cost of services provided by us to the management company and a million decrease in deferred compensation expense  from million in to million in the deferred compensation expense represents the net increase in the fair value of investments in two deferred compensation trusts  which we refer to as the deferred compensation trusts  for the benefit of the executives  as explained in more detail below under income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 
the decrease from includes the effect of a million impairment charge related to a significant decline in value of one of the investments in the deferred compensation trusts recognized in with a corresponding equal reduction of investment income  net 
as indicated above  effective january   we adopted sfas r which revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation  which we refer to as sfas as a result  we now measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments  including grants of employee stock options and restricted stock  based on the fair value of the award at the date of grant rather than its intrinsic value  the method we previously used 
we are using the modified prospective application method under sfas r and have elected not to use retrospective application 
thus  amortization of the fair value of all nonvested grants as of january   as determined under the previous pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas  except as adjusted for estimated forfeitures  is included in our results of operations commencing january   and prior periods are not restated 
employee stock compensation grants or grants modified  repurchased or cancelled on or after january  are valued in accordance with sfas r 
had we used the fair value alternative under sfas during  our pretax compensation expense using the black scholes merton option pricing model would have been million higher  or million after taxes and minority interests  determined from the pro forma disclosure in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation grants which is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
the adoption of sfas r may also materially affect our share based compensation expense in future periods as a result of any share based compensation grants subsequent to december  the company s total share based compensation included in general and administrative expenses decreased million  reflecting a million increase in our restaurant segment more than offset by an million decrease excluding our restaurant segment as disclosed above 
the million net decrease principally reflects a million provision in for the intrinsic value of stock options exercised by the executives that were replaced by us on the date of exercise  as compared with a million provision in for the fair value of stock options granted by us to replace stock options exercised by two senior executive officers other than the executives  in each case for our own tax planning reasons 
we also recognized million of lower share based compensation on equity instruments of certain subsidiaries and our contingently issuable performance based restricted shares of our class a and class b common stock granted in due to the declining amounts of compensation expense  which is recognized ratably over their vesting periods  principally as a result of vesting during these decreases were partially offset by the additional compensation expense of million for the fair value of stock options recognized in under sfas r 
depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs our depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs increased million  principally reflecting the full year effect in of the rtm acquisition and  to a much lesser extent  a million increase in asset impairment charges principally related to underperforming restaurants and early termination of certain asset management contracts for cdos 
facilities relocation and corporate restructuring the charges of million in included million of general corporate expense principally representing a fee related to our decision in to terminate the lease of an office facility in rye brook  new york rather than continue our efforts to sublease the facility 
the charges of million in principally related to combining our then existing restaurant operations with those of rtm following the rtm acquisition  as discussed in more detail in the comparison of with loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights the loss of million in related to certain of the franchised restaurants we acquired during the year and the loss of million in consisted principally of million in connection with the rtm acquisition 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as gaap  we are required to record as an expense and exclude from the purchase price of acquired restaurants the value of any franchise agreements that is attributable to royalty rates below the current royalty rate that we receive on new franchise agreements 
the amounts of the settlement losses represent the present value of the estimated amount of future royalties by which the royalty rate is unfavorable over the remaining life of the franchise agreements 
interest expense interest expense increased million reflecting a million increase in interest expense on debt securities sold with an obligation to purchase or under agreements to repurchase in connection with the significant increase in the use of leverage in the opportunities fund prior to our effectively redeeming our investment as of september   which we refer to as the redemption see the paragraph below  an million net increase in interest expense reflecting the higher average debt of our restaurant segment following the july  term loan borrowing  which we refer to as the term loan  to provide financing for the rtm acquisition and to refinance then existing higher interest rate debt of our restaurant segment  which we refer to as the refinancing  and million of interest expense principally relating to the full year effect in of an increase in sale leaseback and capitalized lease obligations due to the obligations assumed in the rtm acquisition and obligations entered into subsequently both for new restaurants opened and the renewal of expiring leases 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in interest expense related to our convertible notes due  which we refer to as the convertible notes  due to the conversion or effective conversion of an aggregate million principal amount of the convertible notes into shares of our class a and class b common stock mostly in february  which we refer to as the convertible notes conversions  as discussed in more detail below under liquidity and capital resources convertible notes 
as a result of the redemption we no longer consolidate the opportunities fund subsequent to september  thus  interest expense and related net investment income  are no longer affected by the significant leverage associated with the opportunities fund after september   substantially reducing interest expense thereafter 
interest expense and net investment income associated with the opportunities fund were million and million  respectively  for on june  and september   we made term loan principal prepayments from excess cash of million and million  respectively  which we refer to as the term loan prepayments  which effective as of the respective repayment dates have reduced our interest expense for the term loan thereafter 
insurance expense related to long term debt insurance expense related to long term debt of million in did not recur in due to the repayment of the related debt as part of the refinancing 
loss on early extinguishments of debt the loss on early extinguishments of debt of million in resulted from the refinancing and consisted of million of prepayment penalties  million of write offs of previously unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount  million of accelerated insurance payments related to the extinguished debt and million of fees 
the loss on early extinguishments of debt of million in consisted of million which resulted from the convertible notes conversions and consisted of million of negotiated inducement premiums that we paid in cash and shares of our class b common stock  the write off of million of related previously unamortized deferred financing costs and million of fees related to the conversions and a million write off of previously unamortized deferred financing costs in connection with the term loan prepayments 
investment income  net the following table summarizes and compares the major components of investment income  net change in millions interest income other than temporary unrealized losses recognized net gains distributions  including dividends other interest income increased million principally due to higher average outstanding balances of our interest bearing investments reflecting the use of significant leverage in the opportunities fund prior to the redemption see the paragraph below 
average rates on our investments increased from in to in in addition  the increase in the average rates was principally due to our investing through the use of leverage in the opportunities fund in some higher yielding  but more risk inherent  debt securities with the objective of improving the overall return on our interest bearing investments and the general increase in the money market and short term interest rate environment 
despite the higher outstanding balances of our interest bearing investments  these balances  net of related leveraging liabilities  decreased principally due to the liquidation of some of those investments to provide cash principally for the rtm acquisition in july our other than temporary unrealized losses increased million  reflecting the recognition of a million impairment charge related to the significant decline in the market value of one of the investments in the deferred compensation trusts in the million impairment charge related to the deferred compensation trusts had a corresponding equal reduction of general and administrative  excluding depreciation and amortization 
any other than temporary unrealized losses are dependant upon the underlying economics and or volatility in the value of our investments in available for sale securities and cost method investments and may or may not recur in future periods 
our recognized net gains include realized gains and losses on sales of our available for sale securities and our investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting and realized and unrealized gains and losses on changes in the fair values of our trading securities  including derivatives  and our securities sold short with an obligation to purchase  which were principally recognized by the opportunities fund and the dm fund 
the million decrease in our recognized net gains is principally due to lesser gains realized on the sales of two investment limited partnerships in compared with the gains realized on the sales of two investment limited partnerships in  partially offset by a gain realized on the sale of another cost method investment in which did not occur in all of these recognized gains and losses may vary significantly in future periods depending upon the timing of the sales of our investments  or the changes in the value of our investments  as applicable 
as a result of the redemption  our net investment income and interest expense are no longer affected by the significant leverage associated with the opportunities fund after september  investment income  net and interest expense associated with the opportunities fund were million and million  respectively  for as of december   we had unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale marketable securities before income taxes and minority interests of million and million  respectively  included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we evaluated the unrealized losses to determine whether these losses were other than temporary and concluded that they were not 
should either we decide to sell any of these investments with unrealized losses or any of the unrealized losses continue such that we believe they have become other than temporary  we would recognize the losses on the related investments at that time 
gain on sale of unconsolidated businesses the gain on sale of unconsolidated businesses decreased million to million for from million for this decrease principally reflects a million decrease in gains on sales of portions of our investment in encore capital group  inc  an equity investee of ours which we refer to as encore and a million decrease in non cash gains from a our equity in the net proceeds to both the reit in and encore in and from their sales of stock  including shares issued for an encore business acquisition in and exercises of stock options  over the portion of our respective carrying values allocable to our decrease in ownership percentages and b the final amortization in of deferred gain on a restricted encore stock award to a former officer of ours 
in accordance with our accounting policy  we recognize a non cash gain or loss upon sale by an equity investee of any previously unissued stock to third parties to the extent of the decrease in our ownership of the investee to the extent realization of the gain is reasonably assured 
these decreases were partially offset by a million gain on sale of a portion of our cost basis investment in jurlique international pty ltd  an australian skin and beauty products company not publicly traded  which we refer to as jurlique 
other income  net other income  net increased million  principally due to million of the full year effect in of rental income on restaurants leased primarily to franchisees  million of costs recognized in related to our decision not to pursue a certain financing alternative in connection with the rtm acquisition and million of costs incurred in related to a business acquisition proposal we submitted but was not accepted 
the positive effect of these factors on other income in were partially offset by million of costs recognized in related to a strategic business alternative that was not pursued  a million decrease from the foreign currency transaction and derivatives related to jurlique from gains of million in to losses of million in  a million gain recognized in on lease termination of an underperforming company owned restaurant and a million recovery in upon collection of a fully reserved non trade note receivable held by a subsidiary which predated our acquisition of that subsidiary 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests our income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests improved million to income of million in from a loss of million in this improvement is attributed principally to the decrease in certain significant charges in as compared with  including a million decrease in the loss on early extinguishments of debt  reflecting higher charges associated with the refinancing in as compared with the charges associated with our convertible notes conversions and term loan prepayments in  a million decrease in the loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights principally reflecting a million loss in in connection with the rtm acquisition  a million decrease in total share based compensation  of which million was reflected in general and administrative expenses  including million of compensation expense in for the intrinsic value of stock options exercised by the executives and replaced by us and a million decrease in facilities relocation and corporate restructuring charges principally in connection with combining our existing restaurant operations with those of rtm following the rtm acquisition 
the effects of the other variances are discussed in the captions above 
as discussed above  we recognized deferred compensation expense of million in and million in  within general and administrative expenses  for net increases in the fair value of investments in the deferred compensation trusts 
under gaap  we recognize investment income for any interest or dividend income on investments in the deferred compensation trusts  realized gains on sales of investments in the deferred compensation trusts and investment losses for any losses deemed to be other than temporary  but are unable to recognize any investment income for unrealized increases in the fair value of those investments in the deferred compensation trusts that are accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
accordingly  we recognized net investment income from investments in the deferred compensation trusts of million in and net investment losses of million in the net investment income in consisted of realized gains from the sale of certain cost method investments in the deferred compensation trusts of million  which included increases in value prior to of million  interest income of million  less management fees of million 
the net investment loss during consists of an impairment charge of million related to an investment fund within the deferred compensation trusts which experienced a significant decline in market value which we deemed to be other than temporary and management fess of less than million  less realized gains from the sale of certain cost method investments of million  which included increases in value prior to of million  equity in earnings of an equity method investment purchased and sold during of million and interest income of million 
the cumulative disparity between deferred compensation expense and net recognized investment income and the obligation to the executives and the carrying value of the assets in the deferred compensation trusts will reverse in future periods as either additional investments in the deferred compensation trusts are sold and previously unrealized gains are recognized without any offsetting increase in compensation expense or the fair values of the investments in the deferred compensation trusts decrease  other than with respect to losses deemed to be other than temporary  resulting in the recognition of a reversal of compensation expense without any offsetting losses recognized in investment income 
provision for benefit from income taxes the benefit from income taxes represented an effective rate of in and the provision for income taxes represented an effective rate of in on the respective income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 
the effective benefit rate in was lower than  and the effective provision rate in is higher than  the united states federal statutory rate of principally due to the effect of non deductible compensation and other non deductible expenses  state income taxes  net of federal income tax benefit  due to the differing mix of pretax income or loss among the consolidated subsidiaries which file state tax returns on an individual company basis and in the non deductible loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights discussed above 
these effects were partially offset by the effect of minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries which were not taxable to us but which are not deducted from the pretax income loss used to calculate the effective tax rates 
the effects of each of these items on the effective tax and benefit rates were significantly different in and due to the relative levels of income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests in each of those years 
minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries the minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million  principally reflecting an increase of million due to increased income of deerfield exclusive of costs discussed below in which we did not participate and an increase of million due to the increased participation of investors other than us in increased income of the opportunities fund prior to the redemption on september  these increases were partially offset by million of costs related to a strategic business alternative that was not pursued that were incurred on behalf of and allocated entirely to the minority shareholders of deerfield and  accordingly  are reflected as a reduction of minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries in income loss from discontinued operations the income loss from discontinued operations declined million from income of million for to a loss of million for the loss in consists of a million loss from operations related to our closing two underperforming restaurants  substantially offset by gains on disposal consisting of the release of million of reserves for state income taxes no longer required upon the expiration of a state income tax statute of limitations and the release of million of certain other accruals as a result of revised estimates to liquidate the remaining liabilities 
during we recorded an additional gain on disposal of million resulting from the release of million of reserves for state income taxes no longer required upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for examinations of certain of our state income tax returns and a million gain from a sale of a former refrigeration property that had been held for sale and a reversal of a related reserve for potential environmental liabilities associated with the property that were assumed by the purchaser 
net loss our net loss decreased million to million in from million in this improvement is attributed principally to decreases in the after tax and applicable minority interest effects of certain significant charges in as compared with  including million from the loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights  million from the loss on early extinguishments of debt  million from share based compensation and million from the facilities relocation and corporate restructuring charges  as well as the after tax and minority interest effects of other variances  as discussed in the captions above  all partially offset by the million decrease in income from discontinued operations 
compared with net sales our net sales  which were generated entirely from the company owned restaurants  increased million to million for from million for  reflecting million of net sales attributable to the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition and net restaurants added during after the rtm acquisition 
aside from the effect of the rtm acquisition and the net restaurants added thereafter during and a million effect of the inclusion of a rd week in  net sales increased million principally due to an approximate growth in same store sales of the restaurants we already owned prior to the rtm acquisition 
the increase in same store sales reflected introductions of new market fresh sandwiches and wraps and other menu items in  improved marketing including a an increase in print media advertising  primarily couponing  b the implementation of then new menu boards focused on combination meals and c more focused value menu programs and operational initiatives targeting continued improvement in customer service levels and convenience 
the positive effects of these factors were partially offset by less favorable performance in company owned restaurants in the economically weaker michigan region  an area where approximately one third of the restaurants we already owned prior to the rtm acquisition are located and the effect of higher fuel prices on consumers discretionary income which we believe had a negative impact on our sales during the second half of the restaurants we acquired in the rtm acquisition had lower same store sales performance for the period subsequent to the rtm acquisition principally reflecting new product performance in the third quarter that was less successful than that of  which had particularly strong same store sales performance with respect to those restaurants 
royalties and franchise and related fees our royalties and franchise and related fees  which were generated entirely from the franchised restaurants  decreased million to million for from million for  reflecting a million decrease in royalties and franchise and related fees from rtm from million in to million in this decrease was principally due to the elimination in consolidation of royalties and franchise and related fees from rtm for the portion of subsequent to the rtm acquisition 
excluding the royalties and franchise and related fees from rtm and an estimated million effect of the inclusion of the rd week in which did not recur in  royalties and franchise and related fees increased million  reflecting a million net increase in royalties from the franchised restaurants opened in  with generally higher than average sales volumes  replacing the royalties from the generally underperforming restaurants closed in  a million improvement in royalties due to a increase in same store sales of the franchised restaurants  excluding the stores acquired in the rtm acquisition  in as compared with and a million improvement in royalties as a result of slightly higher average royalty rates 
the increase in same store sales of the franchised restaurants reflects the impact of new market fresh sandwiches and wraps and other menu items introduced in  improved marketing reflecting a the implementation of new menu boards  primarily by our larger franchisees  focused on combination meals  and b more targeted and value oriented local marketing programs and operational initiatives targeting continued improvement in customer service levels and convenience 
partially offsetting these positive factors was the effect of higher fuel prices on consumers discretionary income which we believe had a negative impact on our franchisees sales in the second half of franchise and related fees  excluding those from rtm  were relatively unchanged between the years 
asset management and related fees our asset management and related fees  which were generated entirely from the management of cdos and funds following the deerfield acquisition  increased million to million for from million for approximately million of this increase was due to the effect of including deerfield in our results for all of but only the portion of following the july  acquisition date 
aside from this effect  asset management and related fees increased approximately million  of which million was attributable to the reit which commenced in december the remaining increase of million in asset management and related fees was principally due to an increase in assets under management and the recording of million of incentive fees in the period as an asset in connection with our accounting for the purchase of deerfield and thus excluding them from our revenues 
cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization our cost of sales  excluding depreciation and amortization resulted entirely from the company owned restaurants 
cost of sales increased million to million for  resulting in a gross margin of  from million for  resulting in a gross margin of 
of this increase  million is attributable to the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition and the net restaurants added during after the rtm acquisition  which had a gross margin of 
aside from the effect of the rtm acquisition and the net restaurants added thereafter and a million effect of the inclusion of the rd week in which did not recur in  cost of sales increased million  or  resulting in a gross margin of in compared with in the increase in cost of sales of the restaurants we already owned prior to the rtm acquisition was due to their increased net sales discussed above 
the improvement of in gross margin of those restaurants is primarily attributable to improved product mix reflecting higher sales of combination meals  which result in more sales of higher margin components and are emphasized in our then new menu board marketing  improved oversight and training of store management  improved operational reporting made available by the back office and point of sale restaurant systems implemented in the latter part of  which facilitated reduced food waste and increased labor efficiencies and the impact of price increases implemented primarily in the second half of for some of our menu items 
partially offsetting these improvements were higher costs related to incentive compensation as a result of improved performance of those restaurants 
the gross margin for the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition was significantly higher than that of the restaurants we already owned prior to the rtm acquisition due to rtm s relatively more effective operational efficiencies resulting from management and procedural advantages as well as higher average unit sales volumes of the rtm restaurants which result in more favorable cost leverage 
cost of services  excluding depreciation and amortization our cost of services  excluding depreciation and amortization  which resulted entirely from the management of cdos and funds following the deerfield acquisition  increased million to million for from million for approximately million of this increase was due to the effect of including deerfield for only the portion of following the july  acquisition date 
aside from this effect  cost of services increased approximately million principally due to higher incentive compensation costs related to the increase in asset management and related fees described above and  to a much lesser extent  the hiring of additional personnel to support our growth in assets under management 
our royalties and franchise and related fees have no associated cost of services 
advertising and promotions our advertising and promotions expenses consist of third party costs for local and national television  radio  direct mail and outdoor advertising as well as point of purchase materials and local restaurant marketing 
these expenses increased million  reflecting million of advertising and promotions attributable to the restaurants acquired in the rtm acquisition 
aside from the effect of the rtm acquisition  advertising and promotions expenses increased million principally due to increased spending of the restaurants we already owned prior to the rtm acquisition for print media campaigns  primarily couponing 
general and administrative  excluding depreciation and amortization our general and administrative expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization increased million partially reflecting general and administrative expenses of million of rtm and million attributable to the full year effect in of the deerfield acquisition 
aside from the effects of the rtm acquisition and the deerfield acquisition  general and administrative expenses increased million principally due to a million increase in share based compensation see the discussion in the following paragraph  a million increase in other employee compensation reflecting higher incentive compensation costs  increased headcount and higher employer payroll taxes principally on the share based compensation  a million increase in rent expense due principally to rent expense for duplicative office space in and other increases of million 
partially offsetting these increases were a million aggregate decrease in employee severance  relocation and recruiting costs  excluding those costs reported in facilities relocation and corporate restructuring in  a million decrease in insurance expense due principally to a non recurring million expense in for an environmental liability insurance policy and a million decrease in deferred compensation expense  from million in to million in deferred compensation expense represents the net increase in the fair value of investments in two deferred compensation trusts for the benefit of the executives  as explained in more detail below under loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 
the million increase in share based compensation reflects a a million provision for the intrinsic value of stock options exercised in december by the executives that were replaced by us on the date of exercise for our own tax planning reasons  b recognition of million related to the grant in march of shares of our contingently issuable performance based restricted class a and class b common stock  respectively  and c amortization of million related to the grant in november of equity interests in two of our subsidiaries that hold our interests in deerfield and jurlique granted to certain members of our management 
depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs our depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs increased million  principally reflecting million of depreciation and amortization of rtm and million attributable to the effect of the deerfield acquisition occurring on july  facilities relocation and corporate restructuring the charges of million in consisted of million related to our restaurant segment and million of general corporate charges 
the million of charges in our restaurant segment principally related to combining our existing restaurant operations with those of rtm following the rtm acquisition and relocating the corporate office of the restaurant group from fort lauderdale  florida to new offices in atlanta  georgia 
rtm and afa service corporation  an independently controlled advertising cooperative  concurrently relocated from their former facilities in atlanta to the new offices in atlanta 
the charges consisted of severance and employee retention incentives  employee relocation costs  lease termination costs and office relocation expenses 
the general corporate charges of million related to our decision in december not to move our corporate offices from new york city to a newly leased office facility in rye brook  new york 
this charge represented our estimate as of the end of of all future costs  net of estimated sublease rental income  related to the rye brook lease subsequent to the decision not to move the corporate offices 
loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights our loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights of million in principally consisted of million in connection with the rtm acquisition 
this loss was recognized in accordance with gaap as discussed in more detail in the comparison of with interest expense interest expense increased million reflecting a million increase in interest expense on debt securities sold with an obligation to purchase or under agreements to repurchase in connection with the use of significant leverage in the opportunities fund  which did not commence until october  a million net increase in interest expense in connection with the rtm acquisition  the release in of million of interest accruals no longer required upon the finalization by the internal revenue service of its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and december   which we refer to as the irs examination  and million of interest expense relating to sale leaseback and capitalized lease obligations of rtm which we acquired but which were not refinanced and  to a much lesser extent  additional obligations for new restaurants opened subsequent to the rtm acquisition 
the net increase in interest expense in connection with the rtm acquisition reflects a million net increase in our level of new debt following the refinancing compared with our previous debt that was refinanced due to the refinancing of million of acquired debt of rtm and million of new debt proceeds used to fund a portion of the purchase price in the rtm acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses  including million related to the early extinguishment of debt discussed below under loss on early extinguishments of debt 
this effect on interest expense of the million increased level of debt is partially offset by the effect of the lower interest rate on the new debt 
insurance expense related to long term debt insurance expense related to long term debt decreased million principally due to the repayment of the related debt as part of the refinancing 
all insurance costs relating to periods subsequent to the debt repayment were paid in connection with the refinancing and reported in loss on early extinguishments of debt 
loss on early extinguishments of debt the loss on early extinguishments of debt of million in resulted from the refinancing and consisted of million of prepayment penalties  million of write offs of previously unamortized deferred financing costs and original issue discount  million of accelerated insurance payments related to the extinguished debt and million of fees 
investment income  net the following table summarizes and compares the major components of investment income  net change in millions interest income other than temporary unrealized losses recognized net gains distributions  including dividends other interest income increased million principally due to higher average outstanding balances of our interest bearing investments due to the use of leverage in the opportunities fund 
in addition  average rates on our investments increased from in to in the increase in the average rates was principally due to our investing through the use of leverage in the opportunities fund in some higher yielding  but more risk inherent  debt securities with the objective of improving the overall return on our interest bearing investments  and the general increase in the money market and short term interest rate environment 
despite the higher outstanding balances of our interest bearing investments  these balances  net of related leveraging liabilities  decreased principally due to the liquidation of some of those investments to provide cash for the deerfield acquisition in july and the rtm acquisition in july our other than temporary unrealized losses  as discussed in more detail in the comparison of with  decreased million reflecting the recognition of million of impairment charges in based on significant declines in market values of some of our higher yielding  but more risk inherent  debt investments  as well as declines in three of our available for sale investments in publicly traded companies  compared with million of other than temporary unrealized losses in related to various securities  including a large publicly traded company which represented million of these losses 
our recognized net gains  as discussed in more detail in the comparison of with  increased million principally due to an increase in realized gains on sales of available for sale securities and an unrealized gain on put and call option combinations on an equity security in  both partially offset by lower gains realized on the sales of several investment limited partnerships and other cost method investments in compared with during and  our recognized net gains included million and million  respectively  of realized gains from the sale of certain cost method investments in the deferred compensation trusts  as explained in more detail below under loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests

other income  net other income  net increased million  principally due to a million improvement in foreign currency transaction and derivatives related to jurlique from losses of million in to gains of million in  million of rental income of rtm in subsequent to the rtm acquisition on restaurants leased primarily to franchisees  a million increase in equity in net earnings of investees entirely due to equity in earnings of the reit  in which we made an investment in december  a million gain on lease termination in of an underperforming company owned restaurant and a million recovery in upon collection of a fully reserved non trade note receivable held by a subsidiary which predated our acquisition of that subsidiary 
these increases were partially offset by million of costs recognized in related to our decision not to pursue a certain financing alternative in connection with the rtm acquisition and a million decrease in costs related to proposed business acquisitions not consummated to million in from million in loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests our loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests increased million to million in from million in attributed to the increase in share based compensation of million  including million of compensation expense in for the intrinsic value of the stock options exercised by the executives and replaced by us  the loss on settlements of unfavorable franchise rights of million  the facilities relocation and corporate restructuring charges of million and the loss on early extinguishments of debt of million  the latter three items principally in connection with the rtm acquisition  as well as the effect of the other variances discussed in the captions above 
as discussed above  we recognized deferred compensation expense of million in and million in  within general and administrative expenses  for net increases in the fair value of investments in the deferred compensation trusts 
under gaap  we recognize investment income for any interest or dividend income on investments in the deferred compensation trusts  realized gains on sales of investments in the deferred compensation trusts and investment losses for any losses deemed to be other than temporary  but are unable to recognize any investment income for unrealized increases in the fair value of those investments in the deferred compensation trusts that are accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
accordingly  we recognized net investment income from investments in the deferred compensation trusts of million and million in and  respectively  consisting of realized gains from the sale of certain cost method investments in the deferred compensation trusts of million and million  respectively  which included increases in value prior to and of million and million  respectively  interest and dividend income of less than million in and million in  less investment management fees of million in each year 
benefit from income taxes the benefit from income taxes represented effective rates of in and in on the respective losses from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests 
the effective benefit rate in is lower due to the release of million of income tax reserves related to our continuing operations in which were no longer required upon the finalization of the irs examination and a state income tax examination and the expiration of the statute of limitations for examinations of certain state income tax returns 
we did not release any income tax reserves relating to continuing operations in minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries the minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries increased million  reflecting million due to the effect of the deerfield acquisition in july  million due to increased income of deerfield and million due to the participation of investors other than us in the opportunities fund

liquidity and capital resources cash flows from continuing operating activities our consolidated operating activities from continuing operations provided cash and cash equivalents  which we refer to in this discussion as cash  of million during principally reflecting operating investment adjustments of million 
the net operating investment adjustments principally reflect million of net proceeds from sales of trading securities and settlements of trading derivatives which were used for the net payments to cover securities sold short and to make net payments under repurchase agreements 
under gaap  the net sales of trading securities and the net settlements of trading derivatives must be reported in continuing operating activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  net amounts to cover securities sold short and net payments under repurchase agreements are reported in continuing investing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows 
the cash used by changes in current assets and liabilities associated with operating activities of million principally reflects an million decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities principally due to accelerated payments to vendors in and unusually high balances at year end due to strategic purchases of fountain beverage products in late other adjustments to reconcile the million net loss to the cash provided by continuing operating activities were principally comprised of non cash adjustments for depreciation and amortization of million  a share based compensation provision of million and minority interests in income of consolidated subsidiaries of million  all partially offset by payments of million of withholding taxes relating to stock compensation for which the company withheld as payment  at the option of the respective employees  shares of its common stock that would otherwise have been issuable upon the exercises of stock options and vesting of restricted stock 
excluding the effect of the net sales of trading securities and net settlements of trading derivatives  which represent the liquidation of discretionary investments of excess cash  our continuing operating activities provided cash of million in we expect positive cash flows from continuing operating activities again during  excluding the effect  if any  of net sales or purchases of trading securities and possible severance and contractual settlement payments in connection with a potential corporate restructuring as discussed below under potential corporate restructuring 
working capital and capitalization working capital  which equals current assets less current liabilities  was million at december   reflecting a current ratio  which equals current assets divided by current liabilities  of working capital at december  decreased million from million at january   primarily resulting from dividend payments of million and the term loan prepayments of million

credit agreement in connection with the rtm acquisition  we entered into a credit agreement  which we refer to as the credit agreement  for our restaurant segment 
the credit agreement includes the term loan with a remaining principal balance of million as of december  and a senior secured revolving credit facility of million  under which there were no borrowings as of december  however  the availability under the facility as of december  was million  which is net of a reduction of million for outstanding letters of credit 
the term loan is due million in each year through  million in and million in however  the term loan requires prepayments of principal amounts resulting from certain events and  beginning in  from excess cash flow of the restaurant segment as determined under the credit agreement 
sale leaseback obligations we have outstanding million of sale leaseback obligations as of december   which relate to our restaurant segment and are due through  of which million is due in capitalized lease obligations we have outstanding million of capitalized lease obligations as of december   which relate to our restaurant segment and extend through  of which million is due in convertible notes we have outstanding at december   million of convertible notes which do not have any scheduled principal repayments prior to and are convertible into  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock 
the convertible notes are redeemable at our option commencing may  and at the option of the holders on may   and or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change  as defined  relating to us  in each case at a price of of the principal amount of the convertible notes plus accrued interest 
in  an aggregate of million principal amount of the convertible notes were converted or effectively converted into an aggregate of  shares of our class a common stock and  shares of our class b common stock

other long term debt we have outstanding a secured bank term loan payable through in the amount of million as of december   of which million is due in we also have outstanding million under a revolving note which is due in but which we expect to repay during additionally  we have outstanding million of leasehold notes as of december   which are due through  of which million is due in notes payable we have outstanding million of notes payable as of december  which relate to our asset management segment and are secured by some of our short term investments in preferred shares of cdos as of december  these notes are non recourse except in limited circumstances and have no stated maturities but must be repaid from either a portion or all of the distributions we receive on  or sales proceeds from  the respective preferred shares of cdos  as well as a portion of the asset management fees to be paid to us from the respective cdos 
revolving credit facilities we have million available for borrowing under our restaurant segment s million revolving credit facility as of december   which is net of the reduction of million for outstanding letters of credit noted above

this conditional funding commitment  which replaced a similar one which ended on december   ends on june  with the option to extend it for an additional six months 
debt repayments and covenants our total scheduled long term debt and notes payable repayments during are million consisting of million under our term loans  million expected to be paid under our revolving note  million under our secured bank term loan  million expected to be paid under our notes payable  million relating to capitalized leases  million relating to sale leaseback obligations and million under our leasehold notes 
our credit agreement contains various covenants relating to our restaurant segment  the most restrictive of which require periodic financial reporting  require meeting certain leverage and interest coverage ratio tests and restrict  among other matters  a the incurrence of indebtedness  b certain asset dispositions  c certain affiliate transactions  d certain investments  e certain capital expenditures and f the payment of dividends indirectly to triarc 
we were in compliance with all of these covenants as of december  during we made the term loan prepayments aggregating million from excess cash 
we may make additional prepayments of the term loan during under certain circumstances  including if those payments would be necessary for continued compliance with the credit agreement 
as of december  there was million available for the payment of dividends indirectly to triarc under the covenants of the credit agreement 
a significant number of the underlying leases for our sale leaseback obligations and our capitalized lease obligations  as well as our operating leases  require or required periodic financial reporting of certain subsidiary entities within our restaurant segment or of individual restaurants  which in many cases has not been prepared or reported 
we have negotiated waivers and alternative covenants with our most significant lessors which substitute consolidated financial reporting of our restaurant segment for that of individual subsidiary entities and which modify restaurant level reporting requirements for more than half of the affected leases 
nevertheless  as of december   we were not in compliance  and remain not in compliance  with the reporting requirements under those leases for which waivers and alternative financial reporting covenants have not been negotiated 
however  none of the lessors has asserted that we are in default of any of those lease agreements 
we do not believe that this non compliance will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expected payments under our outstanding contractual obligations at december  fiscal years total after in millions long term debt a sale leaseback obligations b capitalized lease obligations b operating leases c deferred compensation payable to related parties d purchase obligations e total a excludes sale leaseback and capitalized lease obligations  which are shown separately in the table  and interest 
b excludes interest 
c represents the future minimum rental obligations  including million of unfavorable lease amounts included in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  which will reduce our rent expense in future periods 
also  these amounts have not been decreased by million of related sublease rental obligations due to us 
d represents amounts due to the executives in  which can be settled either by the payment of cash or transfer of the investments held in the deferred compensation trusts 
e includes an approximate million remaining obligation for our company owned restaurants to purchase pepsico  inc beverage products under an agreement to serve pepsico beverage products in all of our company owned and franchised restaurants and million of purchase obligations for expected future capital expenditures 
guarantees and commitments our wholly owned subsidiary  national propane corporation  which we refer to as national propane  retains a less than special limited partner interest in our former propane business  now known as amerigas eagle propane  lp  which we refer to as amerigas eagle 
national propane agreed that while it remains a special limited partner of amerigas eagle  national propane would indemnify the owner of amerigas eagle for any payments the owner makes related to the owner s obligations under certain of the debt of amerigas eagle  aggregating approximately million as of december   if amerigas eagle is unable to repay or refinance such debt  but only after recourse by the owner to the assets of amerigas eagle 
national propane s principal asset is an intercompany note receivable from triarc in the amount of million as of december  we believe it is unlikely that we will be called upon to make any payments under this indemnity 
prior to amerigas propane  lp  which we refer to as amerigas propane  purchased all of the interests in amerigas eagle other than national propane s special limited partner interest 
either national propane or amerigas propane may require amerigas eagle to repurchase the special limited partner interest 
however  we believe it is unlikely that either party would require repurchase prior to as either amerigas propane would owe us tax indemnification payments if amerigas propane required the repurchase or we would accelerate payment of deferred taxes of million as of december   including million associated with the gain on sale of the propane business and the remainder associated with other tax basis differences  prior to  of our propane business if national propane required the repurchase 
as of december   we have net operating loss tax carryforwards sufficient to offset the remaining deferred taxes 
rtm guarantees the lease obligations of rtm restaurants formerly operated by affiliates of rtm as of december   which we refer to as the affiliate lease guarantees 
the rtm selling stockholders have indemnified us with respect to the guarantee of the remaining lease obligations 
in addition  rtm remains contingently liable for leases for restaurants sold by rtm prior to the rtm acquisition if the respective purchasers do not make the required lease payments 
all of these lease obligations  which extend through  including all existing extension or renewal option periods  could aggregate a maximum of approximately million as of december   including approximately million under the affiliate lease guarantees  assuming all scheduled lease payments have been made by the respective tenants through december  commencing july   two of deerfield s executives will have certain rights to require us to acquire their economic interests in deerfield  which aggregate of the capital interests and of the profit interests  at a price equal to the then current fair market value of those interests and are subject to acceleration under certain circumstances 
capital expenditures cash capital expenditures amounted to million in  including million related to deerfield which is not expected to recur in we expect that cash capital expenditures will be approximately million and non cash capital expenditures consisting of capitalized leases will be approximately million in principally relating to the opening of an estimated new company owned restaurants  remodeling some of our existing restaurants and maintenance capital expenditures for our company owned restaurants 
we have million of outstanding commitments for capital expenditures as of december   of which million is expected to be paid in dividends during we paid regular quarterly cash dividends of and per share on our class a and class b common stock  respectively  aggregating million 
in addition  we paid three special cash dividends of per share each on our class a common stock and class b common stock aggregating million 
on february   we declared regular quarterly cash dividends of and per share on our class a common stock and class b common stock  respectively  payable on march  to holders of record on march  our board of directors has determined that until june  regular quarterly cash dividends paid on each share of class b common stock will be at least of the regular quarterly cash dividends paid on each share of class a common stock  but has not yet made any similar determination beyond that date 
accordingly  after june   our class b common stock will be entitled to participate at least equally on a per share basis with our class a common stock in any cash dividends 
we currently intend to continue to declare and pay regular quarterly cash dividends  however  there can be no assurance that any regular quarterly dividends will be declared or paid in the future or of the amount or timing of such dividends  if any 
if we pay regular quarterly cash dividends for the remainder of at the same rate as declared in our first quarter and do not pay any special cash dividends  our total cash requirement for dividends for all of would be million based on the number of our class a and class b common shares outstanding at february  income taxes during  the internal revenue service finalized its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and december  without any additional income tax liability to us 
our federal income tax returns subsequent to december  are not currently under examination by the internal revenue service although some of our state income tax returns are currently under examination 
we have received notices of proposed tax adjustments aggregating million in connection with certain of these state income tax returns 
however  we have disputed these notices and  accordingly  cannot determine the ultimate amount of any resulting tax liability or any related interest and penalties 
treasury stock purchases our management is currently authorized  when and if market conditions warrant and to the extent legally permissible  to repurchase through june  up to a total of million of our class a and class b common stock 
however  due to the previously announced potential corporate restructuring  as discussed in more detail below under potential corporate restructuring  we expect to be precluded from repurchasing shares at certain times 
we did not make any treasury stock purchases during and we cannot assure you that we will repurchase any shares under this program in the future 
universal shelf registration statement in december  the securities and exchange commission declared effective a triarc universal shelf registration statement in connection with the possible future offer and sale  from time to time  of up to billion of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants to purchase any of these types of securities 
unless otherwise described in the applicable prospectus supplement relating to any offered securities  we anticipate using the net proceeds of each offering for general corporate purposes  including financing of acquisitions and capital expenditures  additions to working capital and repayment of existing debt 
we have not presently made any decision to issue any specific securities under this universal shelf registration statement 
cash requirements our consolidated cash requirements for continuing operations for  exclusive of operating cash flow requirements  consist principally of cash capital expenditures of approximately million  a maximum of an aggregate million of payments for repurchases  if any  of our class a and class b common stock for treasury under our current stock repurchase program  regular quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million  scheduled debt principal repayments aggregating million  any prepayments under our credit agreement and any requirement to repurchase the minority interests in deerfield held by two of its executives 
we anticipate meeting all of these requirements through the use of our liquid net current assets  cash flows from continuing operating activities  if any  borrowings under our restaurant segment s revolving credit facility of which million is unused as of december   the million conditional funding commitment for sale leaseback financing from the real estate finance company  all of which is unused as of january   borrowings under our asset management segment s revolving note of which million is currently available and proceeds from sales  if any  of up to billion of our securities under the universal shelf registration statement 
potential corporate restructuring we are continuing to explore a possible corporate restructuring that is expected to involve the disposition of our asset management operations  whether through a sale of our ownership interest in our asset management business  a spin off of our ownership interest in our asset management business to our stockholders or such other means as our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interests of our stockholders 
any such corporate restructuring is currently expected to  and any other form of corporate restructuring could  involve the principals and our employees who perform services for the management company no longer being officers and employees of the company  in which case it is expected that the management team of arby s would become the management of the company 
in connection with the potential restructuring  in addition to our regular quarterly dividends  in we declared and paid special cash dividends aggregating per share on each outstanding share of our class a common stock and class b common stock  as discussed in more detail above under dividends 
depending on the nature of the restructuring  various arrangements relating to the affected businesses could be necessary  the cost of which has not been determined 
among other things  we have employment agreements and severance arrangements with certain of our executive officers and corporate employees 
if we proceed with a restructuring  we would incur significant severance or contractual settlement payments under these agreements and arrangements  which would result in the company being relieved of its long term obligations under the employment agreements 
in the case of the executives  the amount of such payments would be subject to negotiation and approval by a special committee comprised of independent members of our board of directors which is considering these matters 
there can be no assurance that a corporate restructuring will occur or of the form  terms or timing of such restructuring if it does occur 
our board of directors has not reached any definitive conclusions concerning the scope  benefits or timing of any corporate restructuring 
legal and environmental matters in  a vacant property owned by adams packing association  inc  which we refer to as adams packing  an inactive subsidiary of ours  was listed by the united states environmental protection agency on the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability information system  which we refer to as cerclis  list of known or suspected contaminated sites 
the cerclis listing appears to have been based on an allegation that a former tenant of adams packing conducted drum recycling operations at the site from some time prior to until the late s 
the business operations of adams packing were sold in december in february  adams packing and the florida department of environmental protection  which we refer to as the florida dep  agreed to a consent order that provided for development of a work plan for further investigation of the site and limited remediation of the identified contamination 
in may  the florida dep approved the work plan submitted by adams packing s environmental consultant and during the work under that plan was completed 
adams packing submitted its contamination assessment report to the florida dep in march in august  the florida dep agreed to a monitoring plan consisting of two sampling events which occurred in january and june and the results were submitted to the florida dep for its review 
in november  adams packing received a letter from the florida dep identifying certain open issues with respect to the property 
the letter did not specify whether any further actions are required to be taken by adams packing and adams packing has sought clarification from  and continues to expect to have additional conversations with  the florida dep in order to attempt to resolve this matter 
based on provisions made prior to of million for all of these costs and after taking into consideration various legal defenses available to us  including adams packing  adams packing has provided for its estimate of its remaining liability for completion of this matter 
in addition to the environmental matter described above  we are involved in other litigation and claims incidental to our current and prior businesses 
we and our subsidiaries have reserves for all of our legal and environmental matters aggregating million as of december  although the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted with certainty and some of these matters may be disposed of unfavorably to us  based on currently available information  including legal defenses available to us and or our subsidiaries  and given the aforementioned reserves  we do not believe that the outcome of these legal and environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in applying our critical accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates and assumptions concern  among other things  contingencies for legal  environmental and tax matters  the valuations of some of our investments and impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate those estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements reserves for the resolution of income tax contingencies which are subject to future examinations of our federal and state income tax returns by the internal revenue service or state taxing authorities  including remaining provisions included in current liabilities relating to discontinued operations in our consolidated balance sheets as previously discussed above  in the internal revenue service finalized its examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended december  and december  without assessing any additional income tax liability to us 
in and  to a much lesser extent in and  our results of operations were materially impacted by the release of income tax reserves and related interest accruals that were no longer required as a result of the finalization of the examinations of our federal income tax returns and the expiration of the statute of limitations related to certain state income tax filings 
our federal income tax returns subsequent to december  are not currently under examination by the internal revenue service although some of our state income tax returns are currently under examination 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made principally in prior periods for any liabilities  including interest  that may result from the completion of these examinations 
to the extent that any estimated amount required to liquidate the related liability as it pertains to the former beverage businesses that we sold in october is determined to be less than or in excess of the aggregate of amounts included in current liabilities relating to discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  any such difference will be recorded at that time as a component of gain or loss on disposal of discontinued operations 
to the extent that any estimated amount required to liquidate the related liability as it pertains to our continuing operations is determined to be less than or in excess of the income tax contingency amounts included in other liabilities  any such difference will be recorded at that time as a component of results from continuing operations 
valuations of some of our investments our investments in short term available for sale and trading marketable securities are valued principally based on quoted market prices  broker dealer prices or statements of account received from investment managers which are principally based on quoted market or broker dealer prices 
accordingly  we do not anticipate any significant changes from the valuations of these investments 
our investments in other short term investments accounted for under the cost method and the majority of our non current investments are valued almost entirely based on statements of account received from the investment managers or the investees which are principally based on quoted market or broker dealer prices 
to the extent that some of these investments  including the underlying investments in investment limited partnerships  do not have available quoted market or broker dealer prices  we rely on third party appraisals or valuations performed by the investment managers or the investees in valuing those securities 
these valuations are subjective and thus subject to estimates which could change significantly from period to period 
those changes in estimates in these cost investments would be recognized only to the extent of losses which are deemed to be other than temporary 
the total carrying value of the cost investments not valued based on quoted market or broker dealer prices was approximately million as of december   including an investment included in the deferred compensation trusts with a carrying value of million 
any market value decline with respect to the investment in the deferred compensation trusts would also result in a reduction of the corresponding deferred compensation payable and related deferred compensation expense 
in addition  we have an million cost investment in jurlique  an australian company not publicly traded  for which we currently believe the carrying amount is recoverable as a result of the sale during of a portion of our investment in jurlique at a higher valuation than that reflected in the carrying value 
we also have million of non marketable cost investments in securities for which it is not practicable to estimate fair value because the investments are non marketable and are principally in start up enterprises for which we currently believe the carrying amount is recoverable 
provisions for unrealized losses on certain investments deemed to be other than temporary we review all of our investments that have unrealized losses for any that we might deem other than temporary 
the losses we have recognized were deemed to be other than temporary due to declines in the market value of or liquidity problems associated with specific securities 
this includes the underlying investments of any of our investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities in which we have an overall unrealized loss 
this process is subjective and subject to estimation 
in determining whether an investment  other than preferred shares in cdos  has suffered an other than temporary loss  we consider such factors as the length of time the carrying value of the investment was below its market value  the severity of the decline  the investee s financial condition and the prospect for future recovery in the market value of the investment  including our ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery 
for preferred shares in cdos  we consider whether there has been any adverse change in the estimated cash flows of the investments in the cdos as well as the prospect for future recovery  including our ability and intent to hold the investments for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery 
the use of different judgments and estimates could affect the determination of which securities suffered an other than temporary loss and the amount of that loss 
we have aggregate unrealized holding losses on our available for sale marketable securities of million as of december  which  if not recovered  may result in the recognition of future losses 
also  should any of our investments accounted for under the cost method totaling approximately million  including million held in the deferred compensation trusts as of december   experience declines in value due to conditions that we deem to be other than temporary  we may recognize additional other than temporary losses 
however  as noted in the paragraph above  any declines with respect to investments in the deferred compensation trusts would be fully offset 
we have permanently reduced the cost basis component of the investments for which we have recognized other than temporary losses of million  million and million during  and  respectively 
as such  recoveries in the value of these investments  if any  will not be recognized in income until the investments are sold 
provisions for impairment of goodwill and long lived assets as of december   million of our goodwill relates to our restaurant segment  of which million is associated with the company owned restaurant operating unit  and million relates to our asset management segment 
we test the goodwill of each of our restaurant franchising and company owned restaurant business reporting units and our asset management segment for impairment annually 
we recognize a goodwill impairment charge  if any  for any excess of the net carrying amount of the respective goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined in the same manner as the existing goodwill was determined substituting the fair value for the cost of the reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit has been estimated to be the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with the reporting unit 
we did not incur any goodwill impairment in  or the recoverability of the goodwill in each of those years was based on estimates we made regarding the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with each reporting unit 
those estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors including  among others  any changes in our business plans  changing economic conditions and the competitive environment 
should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used  we may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future years 
further  fair value of the reporting unit can be determined under several different methods  of which discounted cash flows is one alternative 
had we utilized an alternative method  the amount of any potential goodwill impairment charge might have differed significantly from the amounts as determined 
we review our long lived assets  other than goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if that review indicates an asset may not be recoverable based upon forecasted  undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset 
the fair value is estimated to be the present value of the associated cash flows 
our critical estimates in this review process include anticipated future cash flows of each of our company owned restaurants used in assessing the recoverability of their respective long lived assets and anticipated future cash flows of one of our product lines to which a trademark relates 
we recognized related impairment losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  of which million  million and million of the losses in  and  respectively  related to long lived assets of certain restaurants which were determined to not be fully recoverable 
the remaining million impairment loss in  and million and million of the losses in and  respectively  related to the trademark referred to above 
the remaining million and million of the losses in and  respectively  related to the write off of the value of asset management contracts 
the fair values of the impaired assets were estimated to be the present value of the anticipated cash flows associated with each affected company owned restaurant  the trademark and the asset management contracts 
those estimates are subject to change as a result of many factors including  among others  any changes in our business plans  changing economic conditions and the competitive environment 
should actual cash flows and our future estimates vary adversely from those estimates we used  we may be required to recognize additional impairment charges in future years 
further  fair value of the long lived assets can be determined under several different methods  of which discounted cash flows is one alternative 
had we utilized an alternative method  the amounts of the respective impairment charges might have differed significantly from the charges reported 
as of december   the remaining net carrying value of the trademark  the company owned restaurant long lived assets and asset management contracts were million  million and million  respectively 
these long lived assets could require testing for impairment should future events or changes in circumstances indicate they may not be recoverable 
reserves which total million at december  for the resolution of all of our legal and environmental matters as discussed immediately above under legal and environmental matters should the actual cost of settling these matters  whether resulting from adverse judgments or otherwise  differ from the reserves we have accrued  that difference will be reflected in our results of operations when the matter is resolved or when our estimate of the cost changes 
our estimates of each of these items historically have been adequate 
due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is reasonably possible that the actual resolution of any of these items could vary significantly from the estimate and  accordingly  there can be no assurance that the estimates may not materially change in the near term 
inflation and changing prices we believe that inflation did not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations during  and since inflation rates generally remained at relatively low levels 
seasonality our continuing operations are not significantly impacted by seasonality 
however  our restaurant revenues are somewhat lower in our first quarter 
further  while our asset management business is not directly affected by seasonality  our asset management revenues are higher in our fourth quarter as a result of our revenue recognition accounting policy for incentive fees related to the funds which are based upon performance and are recognized when the amounts become fixed and determinable upon the close of a performance period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board  which we refer to as the fasb  issued statement no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which we refer to as sfas sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which we refer to as sfas  and fasb statement  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas resolves issues addressed in sfas implementation issue no 
d  application of statement to beneficial interests in securitized financial assets 
sfas is effective commencing with our first quarter of although early adoption is permitted 
although we hold preferred shares of several cdos  which represent beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that we classify as available for sale securities  we do not believe that any of these interests represent freestanding or embedded derivatives which would be required to be accounted for as derivatives under the provisions of sfas accordingly  we currently do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have any effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we refer to as interpretation interpretation clarifies how uncertainties in income taxes should be reflected in financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
interpretation prescribes a two step process of evaluating a tax position  whereby an entity first determines if it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured for purposes of financial statement recognition as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
interpretation has disclosure requirements which include a rollforward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective tax rate  the total amounts and financial statement classifications of interest and penalties recognized in the balance sheet and statement of operations and a description of tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions 
for positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date  an entity should disclose the nature of the uncertainty  the nature of the event that could occur in the next twelve months that would cause the change and an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change or a statement that an estimate of the range cannot be made 
all disclosures required by interpretation must be included in each quarter s interim financial statements in the year of adoption 
interpretation is effective commencing with our first fiscal quarter of the provisions of interpretation are complex and we have not yet finalized the effect that adopting interpretation will have on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
however  based on our preliminary analysis  management does not expect interpretation will have any material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
as described above  we will be required to provide additional financial statement disclosures upon adoption of interpretation in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities which we refer to as fsp air fsp air prohibits the use of the previously acceptable accrue in advance method of accounting for scheduled major maintenance activities  which is the method we currently use for scheduled major maintenance overhauls of corporate aircraft 
under the accrue in advance method  the estimated cost of such an overhaul is amortized to the date of the next overhaul with any difference between estimated and actual cost charged or credited to income upon completion of the overhaul 
fsp air requires that we use either a direct expensing method  under which the costs of overhauls are charged to operations as incurred  or a deferral method  under which the actual cost of each overhaul is capitalized and amortized until the next overhaul 
fsp air is effective for our first fiscal quarter of we currently expect to adopt the direct expensing method 
we will be required to restate our consolidated financial statements for all prior periods presented for the difference between the accrue in advance method and the method adopted for scheduled major airplane maintenance overhauls with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method reflected as of the beginning of the earliest period presented 
as of december  we have an accrual of  for such costs which  upon adoption of fsp air  will be recorded as an increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of the earliest year presented 
for the year ended december  we have expensed million of costs related to scheduled major maintenance overhauls under the accrue in advance method 
we currently expect to incur approximately million of costs for certain major overhauls on the aircraft in which will be recognized as a charge to results of operations in and thereafter periodic maintenance may prompt significant repairs which would affect our results of operations during the year those costs are incurred 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  which we refer to as sfas sfas addresses issues relating to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value and expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value in sfas focuses on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability  not the price that would be paid to acquire an asset or received to assume a liability 
the methods used to measure fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability 
sfas expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to adoption 
currently some of our investments are assigned fair values based on their bid price 
sfas requires us to use the most representative fair value within the bid asked spread if the fair value of an asset is based on bid and asked prices 
to the extent that these investments are present in our portfolio at the time of adoption of sfas  our consolidated financial position will be affected for any such investments classified as available for sale securities and both our consolidated financial position and results of operations will be affected for any such investments classified as trading securities 
we will also be required to present the expanded fair value disclosures upon adoption of sfas sfas is  with some limited exceptions  to be applied prospectively and is effective commencing with our first fiscal quarter of  although earlier application in our first fiscal quarter of is permitted 
we currently do not plan to adopt sfas prior to our first fiscal quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk certain statements we make under this item a constitute forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of see special note regarding forward looking statements and projections in part i preceding item we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  changes in commodity prices  changes in the market value of our investments and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to these changes using financial instruments we deem appropriate 
interest rate risk our objective in managing our exposure to interest rate changes is to limit their impact on our earnings and cash flows 
we have historically used interest rate cap and or interest rate swap agreements on a portion of our variable rate debt to limit our exposure to the effects of increases in short term interest rates on our earnings and cash flows 
as of december  our notes payable and long term debt  including current portion  aggregated million and consisted of million of variable rate debt  million of capitalized lease and sale leaseback obligations  million of variable rate notes payable and million of fixed rate debt 
at december   we have million of term loan borrowings outstanding under a variable rate seven year senior secured term loan facility 
the term loan currently bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus 
in connection with the terms of the related credit agreement  we have three interest rate swap agreements that fix the london interbank offered rate libor component of the interest rate at  and on million  million and million  respectively  of the outstanding principal amount until september   october  and october   respectively 
the interest rate swap agreements related to the term loans were designated as cash flow hedges and  accordingly  are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet to the extent of the effectiveness of these hedges 
there was no ineffectiveness from these hedges through december  if a hedge or portion thereof is determined to be ineffective  any changes in fair value would be recognized in our results of operations 
in addition  we continue to have an interest rate swap agreement  with an embedded written call option  in connection with our variable rate bank loan of which million principal amount was outstanding as of december   which effectively establishes a fixed interest rate on this debt so long as the one month libor is below 
we did not have any interest rate cap agreements outstanding as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate debt will increase if interest rates decrease 
the fair market value of our investments in fixed rate debt securities will decline if interest rates increase 
see below for a discussion of how we manage this risk 
commodity price risk we purchase certain food products  such as beef  poultry  pork and cheese  that are affected by changes in commodity prices and  as a result  we are subject to variability in our food costs 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is  at times  limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
management monitors our exposure to commodity price risk 
however  we do not enter into financial instruments to hedge commodity prices or hold any significant inventories of these commodities 
in order to ensure favorable pricing for beef  poultry  pork  cheese and other food products  as well as maintain an adequate supply of fresh food products  a purchasing cooperative with our franchisees negotiates contracts with approved suppliers on behalf of the arby s system 
these contracts establish pricing arrangements  and historically have limited the variability of these commodity costs  but do not establish any firm purchase commitments by us or our franchisees 
equity market risk our objective in managing our exposure to changes in the market value of our investments is to balance the risk of the impact of these changes on our earnings and cash flows with our expectations for long term investment returns 
our primary exposure to equity price risk relates to our investments in equity securities  investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities and equity derivatives 
our board of directors has established certain policies and procedures governing the type and relative magnitude of investments we may make 
we have a management investment committee which supervises the investment of certain funds not currently required for our operations but has delegated the discretionary authority to our chairman and chief executive officer and president and chief operating officer  whom we refer to as the executives  to make certain investments 
in addition  our board of directors also delegated authority to these two officers to direct the investment of a portion of our funds 
in december we invested million in an account  which we refer to as the equities account  which is managed by a management company formed by the executives and our vice chairman and from which we can withdraw quarterly upon days prior written notice 
the equities account was invested principally in the equity securities of a limited number of publicly traded companies and cash equivalents and had a fair value of million as of december  foreign currency risk our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to limit the impact of these fluctuations on earnings and cash flows 
as of december   our primary exposure to foreign currency risk related to our million cost method investment in jurlique international pty ltd  an australian company which we refer to as jurlique 
in april we received a return of capital from our investment in jurlique  and sold a portion of our investment in jurlique representing an aggregate million reduction in the carrying value of the investment to million 
we continue to have a put and call arrangement whereby we have limited the overall foreign currency risk of holding this investment through july  in connection with these april transactions  we terminated a portion of the put and call arrangement so that the remaining notional amount approximated the value of the remaining investment 
to a more limited extent  we have exposure to foreign currency risk relating to our investments in certain investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities that hold foreign securities and a total return swap with respect to a foreign equity security 
however  some of the investment managers hedge the foreign currency exposure  thereby substantially mitigating the risk 
the fixed payment reflected in the total return swap is denominated in the same foreign currency as the underlying security thereby also mitigating the foreign currency risk 
we monitor these exposures and periodically determine our need for the use of strategies intended to lessen or limit our exposure to these fluctuations 
we also have a relatively limited amount of exposure to investments in two foreign subsidiaries and export revenues and related receivables denominated in foreign currencies  both of which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
our foreign subsidiary exposures relate to administrative operations in canada and england and our export revenue exposures relate to royalties earned from arby s franchised restaurants in canada 
foreign operations and foreign export revenues for each of the years ended january  and december  together represented only and  respectively  of our total royalties and franchise and related fees and represented less than of our total revenues 
accordingly  an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates versus the united states dollar from their levels at january  and december  would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
overall market risk we balance our exposure to overall market risk by investing a portion of our portfolio in cash and cash equivalents with relatively stable and risk minimized returns 
we periodically interview and select asset managers to avail ourselves of potentially higher  but more risk inherent  returns from the investment strategies of these managers 
we also seek to identify alternative investment strategies that may earn higher returns with attendant increased risk profiles for a portion of our investment portfolio 
we regularly review the returns from each of our investments and may maintain  liquidate or increase selected investments based on this review and our assessment of potential future returns 
we had previously adjusted our asset allocation to increase the portion of our investments that offered the opportunity for higher  but more risk inherent  returns 
in that regard  through september  we had an investment in a multi strategy hedge fund  deerfield opportunities fund  llc  which we refer to as the opportunities fund  which was managed by a subsidiary of ours  and was consolidated by us with minority interests to the extent of participation by investors other than us 
the opportunities fund invested principally in various fixed income securities and their derivatives  as opportunities arose and employed leverage in its trading activities 
as a result of the effective redemption on september  of our investment in the opportunities fund  we no longer consolidate the accounts of this fund subsequent to that date  and therefore no longer bear the associated risks as of december  as of december   the derivatives held in our short term investment portfolios consisted of stock options  put and call combinations on equity securities and a total return swap on an equity security 
we did not designate any of these strategies as hedging instruments and  accordingly  all of these derivative instruments were recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in our results of operations 
we maintain investment holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
as of january  and december   these investments were classified in our consolidated balance sheets as follows in thousands year end cash equivalents included in cash in our consolidated balance sheets short term investments pledged as collateral other short term investments investment settlements receivable current and non current restricted cash equivalents a non current investments certain liability positions related to investments investment settlements payable securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities sold with an obligation to purchase included in other liability positions related to short term investments derivatives in liability positions included in other liability positions related to short term investments a includes non current restricted cash equivalents of  and  as of january  and december   respectively  included in deferred costs and other assets 
our cash equivalents are short term  highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired and consisted principally of cash in mutual fund money market and bank money market accounts  cash in interest bearing brokerage and bank accounts with a stable value  commercial paper of high credit quality entities  united states government debt securities and securities purchased under agreements to resell the following day collateralized by united states government and government agency debt securities

c includes  of preferred shares of collateralized debt obligation vehicles  which we refer to as cdos  which  if sold  would require us to use the proceeds to repay our related notes payable of d there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell certain of these investments at these amounts 
at december  our investments were classified in the following general types or categories in thousands type at cost at fair value c carrying value amount percent cash equivalents a investment settlements receivable restricted cash equivalents investments accounted for as available for sale securities b trading securities non current investments held in deferred compensation trusts accounted for at cost other current and non current investments in investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities accounted for at cost other current and non current investments accounted for at cost equity fair value total cash equivalents and long investment positions certain liability positions related to investments investment settlements payable n a derivatives in liability positions n a a includes  of cash equivalents held in deferred compensation trusts

c there can be no assurance that we would be able to sell certain of these investments at these amounts 
our marketable securities are reported at fair market value and are classified and accounted for either as available for sale or trading with the resulting net unrealized holding gains or losses  net of income taxes  reported either as a separate component of comprehensive income or loss bypassing net income or net loss  or included as a component of net income or net loss  respectively 
our investments in preferred shares of cdos are accounted for similar to debt securities and are classified as available for sale 
investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities and other current and non current investments in which we do not have significant influence over the investees are accounted for at cost 
derivative instruments are similar to trading securities which are accounted for as described above 
realized gains and losses on investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities and other current and non current investments recorded at cost are reported as investment income or loss in the period in which the securities are sold 
investments in which we have significant influence over the investees are accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting under which our results of operations include our share of the income or loss of the investees 
our investments accounted for under the equity method consist of non current investments in two public companies  one of which is a real estate investment trust managed by a subsidiary of ours 
we also hold restricted stock and stock options of the real estate investment trust that we manage  which we received as share based compensation  and which we refer to as the restricted investments 
other than the vested portion of the restricted stock of the real estate investment trust  which we accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting  the restricted investments are accounted for at fair value 
we review all of our investments in which we have unrealized losses and recognize investment losses currently for any unrealized losses we deem to be other than temporary 
the cost basis component of investments reflected in the tables above represents original cost less a permanent reduction for any unrealized losses that were deemed to be other than temporary 
sensitivity analysis for purposes of this disclosure  market risk sensitive instruments are divided into two categories instruments entered into for trading purposes and instruments entered into for purposes other than trading 
our estimate of market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instruments held by us at january  and december  for which an immediate adverse market movement causes a potential material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we believe that the adverse market movements described below represent the hypothetical loss to future earnings and do not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as market conditions  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
the following tables reflect the estimated market risk exposure as of january  and december  based upon assumed immediate adverse effects as noted below in thousands trading purposes year end carrying value interest rate risk equity price risk foreign currency risk carrying value equity price risk equity securities debt securities trading derivatives in asset positions trading derivatives in liability positions the sensitivity analysis of financial instruments held for trading purposes assumes an instantaneous adverse change in the equity markets in which we are invested  an instantaneous one percentage point adverse change in market interest rates and an instantaneous adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the united states dollar  each from their levels at january  and december   with all other variables held constant 
there were no debt securities included in the trading portfolio as of december   and  accordingly  there is no interest rate risk presented as of that date 
the decrease in the amount of our trading securities and associated risks at december  from the prior year principally reflects the effective redemption on september  of our investment in the opportunities fund as discussed above under overall market risk 
the securities included in the trading portfolio as of december  were comprised only of equity securities and options denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  there is no interest rate or foreign currency risk presented as of that date 
the interest rate risk as of january  with respect to our debt securities and our trading derivatives principally in the opportunities fund reflects the effect of the assumed adverse interest rate change on the fair value of each of those securities or derivative positions and does not reflect any offsetting of hedged positions 
the adverse effects on the fair values of the respective securities and derivatives were determined based on market standard pricing models applicable to those particular instruments 
those models consider variables such as coupon rate and frequency  maturity date s  yield and  in the case of derivatives  volatility  price of the underlying instrument  strike price  expiration  prepayment assumptions and probability of default 
other than trading purposes year end carrying value interest rate risk equity price risk foreign currency risk cash equivalents investment settlements receivable restricted cash equivalents available for sale equity securities available for sale asset backed securities available for sale preferred shares of cdos available for sale united states government and government agency debt securities available for sale commercial paper available for sale debt mutual fund investment in jurlique other investments interest rate swaps in an asset position foreign currency put and call arrangement in a net liability position investment settlements payable securities sold under agreements to repurchase securities sold with an obligation to purchase notes payable and long term debt  excluding capitalized lease and sale leaseback obligations year end carrying value interest rate risk equity price risk foreign currency risk cash equivalents investment settlements receivable restricted cash equivalents available for sale equity securities available for sale preferred shares of cdos available for sale debt mutual fund investment in jurlique other investments interest rate swaps in an asset position foreign currency put and call arrangement in a net liability position investment settlements payable put and call option combinations on equity securities notes payable and long term debt  excluding capitalized lease and sale leaseback obligations the sensitivity analysis of financial instruments held at january  and december  for purposes of other than trading assumes an instantaneous one percentage point adverse change in market interest rates  an instantaneous adverse change in the equity markets in which we are invested and an instantaneous adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the united states dollar  each from their levels at january  and december   respectively  and with all other variables held constant 
the equity price risk reflects the impact of a decrease in the carrying value of our equity securities  including those in other investments in the tables above 
the sensitivity analysis also assumes that the decreases in the equity markets and foreign exchange rates are other than temporary 
we have not reduced the equity price risk for available for sale investments and cost investments to the extent of unrealized gains on certain of those investments  which would limit or eliminate the effect of the indicated market risk on our results of operations and  for cost investments  our financial position 
our investments in debt securities and preferred shares of cdos with interest rate risk had a range of remaining maturities and  for purposes of this analysis  were assumed to have weighted average remaining maturities as follows as of january  as of december  range weighted average range weighted average cash equivalents a days days days days days restricted cash equivalents days days days asset backed securities years years years cdos underlying preferred shares years years years years years united states government and government agency debt securities month months months commercial paper days months months debt mutual fund day years years day years years debt securities included in other investments principally held by investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities b years b years a excludes money market funds  interest bearing brokerage and bank accounts and as of january   securities purchased under agreements to resell the following day which were assumed to have no interest rate risk 
b information is not available for the underlying debt investments of these entities 
the interest rate risk for each of these investments in debt securities and the preferred shares of cdos reflects the impact on our results of operations 
assuming we reinvest in similar securities at the time these securities mature  the effect of the interest rate risk of an increase of one percentage point above the existing levels would continue beyond the maturities assumed 
the interest rate risk for our preferred shares of cdos excludes those portions of the cdos for which the risk has been fully hedged 
our cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents included million and million  respectively  as of january  and million and million  respectively  as of december  of mutual fund money market and bank money market accounts and or interest bearing brokerage and bank accounts which are designed to maintain a stable value and  as of january   securities purchased under agreements to resell the following day which  as a result  were assumed to have no interest rate risk 
the interest rate risk presented with respect to our securities sold under agreements to repurchase and securities sold with an obligation to repurchase held at january   which were all financial instruments held almost entirely by the opportunities fund  represented the potential impact an adverse change in interest rates of one percentage point would have had on the fair value of those respective instruments and on our financial position and results of operations 
the securities sold under agreements to repurchase  although bearing fixed rates  principally had maturities of twelve days or less which significantly limited the effect of a change in interest rates on the respective fair values of these instruments 
as of january   the securities sold with an obligation to repurchase represented million of fixed income securities  with a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately years  and million of equity securities 
the adverse effects on the fair value of the respective instruments were determined based on market standard pricing models applicable to those particular instruments which consider variables such as coupon rate and frequency  maturity date s  yield and prepayment assumptions 
as of january  and december   a majority of our debt was variable rate debt and therefore the interest rate risk presented with respect to our million and million  respectively  of variable rate notes payable and long term debt  excluding capitalized lease and sale leaseback obligations  represents the potential impact an increase in interest rates of one percentage point has on our results of operations 
our variable rate notes payable and long term debt outstanding as of january  and december  had a weighted average remaining maturity of approximately six years and five years  respectively 
however  as discussed above under interest rate risk  we have four interest rate swap agreements  one with an embedded written call option  on a portion of our variable rate debt 
the interest rate risk of our variable rate debt presented in the tables above exclude the million for which we designated interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges for the terms of the swap agreements 
as interest rates decrease  the fair market values of the interest rate swap agreements and the written call option all decrease  but not necessarily by the same amount in the case of the written call option and related interest rate swap agreement 
the interest rate risks presented with respect to the interest rate swap agreements represent the potential impact the indicated change has on the net fair value of the swap agreements and embedded written call option and on our financial position and  with respect to the interest rate swap agreement with the embedded written call option which was not designated as a cash flow hedge  also our results of operations 
we only have million of fixed rate debt as of december  for which a potential impact of a decrease in interest rates of one percentage point would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of such debt and  accordingly  is not reflected in the table above 
the foreign currency risk presented for our investment in jurlique as of january  and december  excludes the portion of risk that is hedged by the foreign currency put and call arrangement and by the portion of jurlique s operations which are denominated in united states dollars 
the foreign currency risk presented with respect to the foreign currency put and call arrangement represents the potential impact the indicated change has on the net fair value of such financial instrument and on our financial position and results of operations and has been determined by an independent broker dealer 
for investments in investment limited partnerships and similar investment entities  all of which are accounted for at cost  and other non current investments included in other investments in the tables above  the decrease in the equity markets and the change in foreign currency were assumed for this analysis to be other than temporary 
to the extent such entities invest in convertible bonds which trade primarily on the conversion feature of the securities rather than on the stated interest rate  this analysis assumed equity price risk but no interest rate risk 
the foreign currency risk presented excludes those investments where the investment manager has fully hedged the risk
