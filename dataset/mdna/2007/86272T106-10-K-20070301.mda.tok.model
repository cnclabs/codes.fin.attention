historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  long term property mortgage indebtedness  
table of contents bank credit facilities and through the issuance of additional equity securities 
we believe that these sources of capital will continue to be available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  there are certain factors that may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets if any and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for reits and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but equity and debt financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive or at all
