item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under risk factors herein 
general we were formed in october and commenced operations on march  we are in the business of investing primarily in mortgage related assets including mortgage pass through certificates  collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage loans and other securities representing interests in  or obligations backed by  pools of mortgage loans which can be readily financed 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to stockholders based upon the spread between the interest income on our mortgage related assets and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of these assets 
we are organized for tax purposes as a reit 
accordingly  we generally distribute substantially all of our earnings to stockholders without paying federal or state income tax at the corporate level on the distributed earnings 
at december   our qualified reit assets real estate assets  as defined in the code  cash and cash items and government securities were greater than of our total assets  as compared to the code requirement that at least of our total assets must be qualified reit assets 
greater than of our revenue qualifies for both the source of income test and the source of income test under the reit rules 
we believe we met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distributions of our net income 
therefore  we believe that we continue to qualify as a reit under the provisions of the code 
our investments consist of the following portfolios agency mortgage backed securities  or agency mbs  non agency mortgage backed securities  or non agency mbs  belvedere trust s residential real estate loans  or bt residential loans  and belvedere trust s other mortgage backed securities  or bt other mbs 
on november   we formed belvedere trust  our wholly owned subsidiary 
belvedere trust acquires high credit quality jumbo adjustable rate and hybrid first lien mortgage loans and other mortgage related assets  securitizes a substantial amount of those mortgage loans and then retains a portion of those mbs while selling the balance to third parties in the secondary market 
the mbs that are retained are purchased by a qualified reit subsidiary to maximize tax efficiency on the interest income on those securities 
belvedere trust was formed as a qualified reit subsidiary but it structures securitizations through taxable reit subsidiaries which generally are taxed as c corporations subject to full corporate taxation which  in turn  establish spes that issue securities through remic trusts 
at december   we had total assets of billion 
agency mbs portfolio  consisting of billion  was distributed as follows agency adjustable rate mbs  agency hybrid adjustable rate mbs  agency fixed rate mbs and less than agency floating rate cmos 
non agency mbs portfolio consisted of million of floating rate cmos 
bt other mbs held at december  were approximately million 
belvedere trust had no mortgage loans held for securitization at december  securitized mortgage loans were billion 
at december   belvedere trust s assets comprised of our overall assets  or approximately billion in mortgage related assets 
total equity at december  was million 
common stockholders equity was approximately million  or per share 
for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million 
net loss to common stockholders was million  or a net loss of per diluted share 
this includes a net loss of million on the sale of securities during and a net loss of million for belvedere trust

our net loss to common stockholders was million  or a net loss of per diluted share  based on an average of million shares outstanding 
for the year ended december   our net income was million and our net income available to common stockholders was million  or per diluted share  based on an average of million shares outstanding 
net interest income for the year ended december  totaled million  or of total interest income  compared to million  or of total interest income  for the year ended december  the decline in net interest income is due primarily to the increase in short term interest rates during most of the year and the mismatch between longer maturities on the mortgage related assets and the shorter maturities on the related liabilities that finance those assets 
net interest income is comprised of the interest income earned on mortgage investments less interest expense from borrowings 
interest income net of premium amortization expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
the increase in both interest income and interest expense was due primarily to the increase in short term interest rates during most of the year 
during the year ended december   premium amortization expense for anworth decreased million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million  and for belvedere trust  it increased million  or  from million during the year ended december  to million 
during the year ended december   the decrease in premium amortization expense for anworth resulted from a decrease of the constant prepayment rate of its portfolio and the increase in premium amortization expense for belvedere trust resulted primarily from impairment charges of million related to some of belvedere trust s interest only securities

the proceeds from the sale were used to invest in higher yielding agency mbs 
this loss was partially offset by a gain of approximately million on the sale of million in face amount of bt other mbs 
belvedere trust s sales of bt other mbs were part of its asset liability management program and were designed to reduce credit exposure 
during the year ended december   we realized a gain on sale of securities of thousand  or of total interest income 
during the years ended december  and  we did not have any realized gain or loss on derivative instruments 
total expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in total expenses was due primarily to a decrease in compensation and benefits of thousand due primarily to reductions in compensation at belvedere trust  a decrease in incentive compensation of thousand  a decrease in other expenses of thousand due 
table of contents primarily to reductions of thousand in legal and accounting fees and reductions of thousand in loan subservicing fees and a decrease of thousand related to belvedere trust s offering costs partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses of thousand relating to the residential real estate loans at belvedere trust and an increase in compensation costs of thousand relating to amortization of restricted stock

financial condition agency mbs portfolio at december   we held agency mortgage assets whose amortized cost was approximately billion  consisting primarily of billion of adjustable rate mbs  million of fixed rate mbs and million of floating rate cmos 
this amount represents an approximate increase from the billion held at december  of the adjustable rate agency mbs owned by us  were adjustable rate pass through certificates whose coupons reset within one year 
the remaining consisted of hybrid adjustable rate mbs whose coupons will reset between one year and five years 
hybrid adjustable rate mbs have an initial interest rate that is fixed for a certain period  usually three to five years  and thereafter adjust annually for the remainder of the term of the loan

we analyze our mbs and the extent to which prepayments impact the yield of the securities 
when the rate of prepayments exceeds expectations  we amortize the premiums paid on mortgage assets over a shorter time period  resulting in a reduced yield to maturity on our mortgage assets 
conversely  if actual prepayments are less than the assumed constant prepayment rate  the premium would be amortized over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
non agency mbs portfolio at december   our non agency mbs portfolio consisted of million of cmo floaters with an average coupon of which were acquired at par value 
bt other mbs portfolio at december   belvedere trust s portfolio of bt other mbs at fair value included securities which are backed by first lien hybrid and adjustable rate residential mortgages

hedging we periodically enter into derivative transactions  in the form of forward purchase commitments and interest rate swaps  which are intended to hedge our exposure to rising rates on funds borrowed to finance our investments in securities 
we designate interest rate swap transactions as cash flow hedges 
we also periodically enter into derivative transactions  in the form of forward purchase commitments  which are not designated as hedges 
to the extent that we enter into hedging transactions to reduce our interest rate risk on indebtedness incurred to acquire or carry real estate assets  any income or gain from the disposition of hedging transactions should be qualifying income for purposes of the gross income test  but not the gross income test 
as part of our asset liability management policy  we may enter into hedging agreements such as interest rate caps  floors or swaps 
these agreements would be entered into to try to reduce interest rate risk and would be designed to provide us with income and capital appreciation in the event of certain changes in interest rates 
we review the need for hedging agreements on a regular basis consistent with our capital investment policy 
at december   we were a counter party to swap agreements  which are derivative instruments as defined by the financial accounting standards board in fasb and fasb  with an aggregate notional amount of million and an average maturity of years 
we utilize swap agreements to manage interest rate risk and do not anticipate entering into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes 
in accordance with the swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest during the term of the swap agreements and receive a payment that varies with the three month libor rate 
at december   there were unrealized gains of approximately million on our swap agreements 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of funds consists of repurchase agreements  relative to our agency and non agency mbs portfolio  which totaled billion at december  and belvedere trust s repurchase agreements  which totaled million at december  our other significant source of funds for the year ended december  consisted of payments of principal from our agency mbs portfolio  bt other mbs and belvedere trust s residential real estate loans in the amounts of billion  million and million  respectively 
relative to our agency mbs portfolio at december   all of our repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from one month to months 
belvedere trust enters into its own repurchase agreements 
at december   other than one repurchase agreement that resets monthly based on one month libor  all of belvedere trust s repurchase agreements were fixed rate term repurchase agreements with original maturities ranging from five days to months 
at december   we had borrowing arrangements with different financial institutions and had borrowed funds under repurchase agreements with of these firms 
as the repurchase agreements mature  we enter into new repurchase agreements to take their place 
because we borrow money based on the fair value of our mbs and because increases in short term interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of mbs  our borrowing ability could be reduced and lenders may initiate margin calls in the event short term interest rates increase or the value of our mbs declines for other reasons 
we had adequate cash flow  liquid assets and unpledged collateral with which to meet our margin requirements during the year ended december  we acquire residential mortgage loans from third party originators  including banks and other mortgage lenders  through our belvedere trust subsidiary 
belvedere trust structures securitization transactions primarily through spes such as remic trusts 
the principal business activity involves issuing various series of mbs in the form of pass through certificates or bonds collateralized by residential real estate loans 
the collateral specific to each mbs series is the sole source of repayment of the debt and  therefore  our exposure to loss is limited to our net investment in the collateral 
during the year ended december   belvedere trust did not transfer any residential mortgage loans to securitization trusts 
to date  belvedere trust has transferred approximately billion of residential real estate loans to securitization trusts 
these transactions except for the first transaction which is more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements utilized non qualified spes requiring consolidation  which effectively resulted in the transactions being accounted for as financings 
the servicing of the residential real estate loans is performed by third parties under servicing arrangements that resulted in no servicing asset or liability 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  belvedere trust has the opportunity to invest in asset classes other than mortgage loans intended for securitization 
such investments may be attractive  among other times  when the cost of acquiring residential real estate loans has increased to a point where it becomes un economical to securitize these loans 
this situation may happen at various points of the business and credit cycle  especially when loan production decreases 
belvedere trust has not securitized loans since may  because of such circumstances 
investments have instead been made in senior and subordinated tranches from various issuers securitizations 
the analyses and investment decisions have been based on a similar approach to what belvedere trust typically has done for the acquisition of whole loans intended for its own securitizations 
it is belvedere trust s intent to securitize whole loans again under its shelf registration statement when the price of residential real estate loans relative to securitization execution makes it feasible again 
in the future  we expect that our primary sources of funds will continue to consist of borrowed funds under repurchase agreement transactions and of monthly payments of principal and interest on our mbs portfolio and other mortgage related assets 
our liquid assets generally consist of unpledged mbs  cash and cash equivalents 
during the year ended december   we raised approximately thousand in capital under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan 

table of contents at december   our authorized capital included million shares of par value preferred stock 
during the year ended december   we did not issue any shares of series a preferred stock 
at december   belvedere trust did not have any commitments to purchase mortgage loans 
belvedere trust had whole loan financing facilities which provide for up to million in financing secured by single family mortgage loans 
at december   belvedere trust had no outstanding borrowings under these facilities 
at december   belvedere trust had no commitments to acquire mbs 
during the year ended december   we repurchased as more fully described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
the shares were acquired at prevailing prices through open market transactions and were made subject to restrictions to volume  pricing and timing subject to applicable sec rules 
on february and   we issued an aggregate of million shares of series b cumulative convertible preferred stock  or series b preferred stock  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we intend to use the proceeds from this offering to acquire mortgage related assets consistent with our investment policy

principal is paid on the mbs issued following receipt of principal payments on the loans

stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our agency and non agency mbs and bt other mbs  which are carried on our balance sheet at fair value rather than historical cost 
residential real estate loans are held for investment and carried at historical amortized cost 
based upon these treatments  our total equity base at december  was million 
common stockholders equity was approximately million  or book value per share 
under our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in fair values of assets are assessed to determine whether they are other than temporary 
to the extent we determine that these unrealized fluctuations are not other than temporary  they do not impact gaap income or taxable income but rather are reflected on the balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the assets and reflecting the change in stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income  unrealized gain loss on available for sale securities 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting on all of our assets 
as a result  comparisons with some companies that use historical cost accounting for all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
unrealized changes in the fair value of mbs have one significant and direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive mark to market changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity  while negative changes will tend to reduce borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mbs might reduce our liquidity  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
accumulative other comprehensive income  unrealized loss on available for sale agency mbs was million  or of the amortized cost of agency mbs  at december  this  along with accumulative other comprehensive gain  derivatives  of million  and accumulative other comprehensive gain  other mbs  of million  constitute the total accumulative other comprehensive loss of million 

table of contents critical accounting policies management has the obligation to ensure that its policies and methodologies are in accordance with gaap 
management has reviewed and evaluated its critical accounting policies and believes them to be appropriate 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe that there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to accounting policies described below 
nevertheless  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
our accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management believes the more significant of these to be as follows revenue recognition the most significant source of our revenue is derived from our investments in mortgage related assets 
we reflect income using the effective yield method which  through amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts at an effective yield  recognizes periodic income over the estimated life of the investment on a constant yield basis  as adjusted for actual prepayment activity 
management believes our revenue recognition policies are appropriate to reflect the substance of the underlying transactions 
interest income on our mortgage related assets is accrued based on the actual coupon rate and the outstanding principal amounts of the underlying mortgages 
premiums and discounts are amortized or accreted into interest income over the expected lives of the securities using the effective interest yield method  adjusted for the effects of actual prepayments and estimated prepayments based on the statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and and a rescission of fasb statement no 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds and current market conditions 
if our estimate of prepayments is incorrect  as compared to the aforementioned references  we may be required to make an adjustment to the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts that would have an impact on future income 
interest income on bt other mbs is determined in accordance with fasb emerging issues task force eitf the excess of estimated future cash flows over the initial investment is the accretable yield to be recognized as interest income over the life of the investment using the effective yield method 
if the current fair value of any individual security is lower than its current amortized cost  we determine whether an impairment charge is required to be taken through current income 
if there is a continued adverse change in estimated cash flows considering both the timing and the amount of the cash flows  and taking into consideration receipt of cash flows to date  then the security is written down to fair value  which then becomes the new amortized cost basis for future amortization 
allowance for loan losses we establish and maintain an allowance for estimated loan losses inherent in our residential real estate loan portfolio 
the loan loss reserves are based upon our assessment of various factors affecting the credit quality of our assets including  but not limited to  the characteristics of the loan portfolio  review of loan level data  borrowers credit scores  delinquency and collateral value 
the reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and 
table of contents adjusted as deemed necessary 
the allowance for loan losses on our residential real estate loans is established by taking loan loss provisions through our consolidated statements of income 
valuation and classification of investment securities we carry our investment securities on the balance sheet at fair value 
the fair values of our mbs are generally based on market prices provided by certain dealers who make markets in such securities 
the fair values of other marketable securities are obtained from the last reported sale of such securities on its principal exchange or  if no representative sale is reported  the mean between the closing bid and ask prices 
if  in the opinion of management  one or more securities prices reported to us are not reliable or unavailable  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security it receives from the issuer and available market information 
the fair values reported reflect estimates and may not necessarily be indicative of the amounts we could realize in a current market exchange 
we review various factors ie  expected cash flows  changes in interest rates  credit protection  etc 
in determining whether and to what extent an other than temporary impairment exists 
to the extent that unrealized losses on our agency mbs and bt other mbs are attributable to changes in interest rates and not credit quality  and we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value up to or beyond its cost  which may be maturity  we do not consider these investments to be other than temporarily impaired 
losses on securities classified as available for sale  which are determined by management to be other than temporary in nature  are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to current period income 
variable interest entities belvedere trust structures securitization transactions primarily through non qualified spes such as remic trusts 
the principal business activity involves issuing various series of mbs in the form of pass through certificates or bonds collateralized by residential real estate loans 
the collateral specific to each series of mbs is the sole source of repayment of the debt and  therefore  our exposure to loss is limited to our net investment in the collateral 
under fin  these interests in non qualified spes are deemed to be vies and we are considered the primary beneficiary 
therefore  we consolidate these non qualified spes 
in addition  we consolidate our interests in loans financed through warehouse agreements where we are acquiring assets prior to securitization 
we disclose our interests in vies under fin in the investments in residential real estate loans footnote note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  or fasb  as amended by fasb no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  or fasb  a derivative that is designated as a hedge is recognized as an asset liability and measured at estimated fair value 
in order for our interest rate swap agreements to qualify for hedge accounting  upon entering into the swap agreement  we must anticipate that the hedge will be highly effective  as defined by fasb on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that are highly effective and that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to income when the forecasted transaction affects income eg  when periodic settlement interest payments are due on repurchase agreements 
the swap agreements are carried on our consolidated balance sheets at their fair value based on values obtained from major financial institutions 
hedge ineffectiveness  if any  is recorded in current period income 
we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of hedged items 
table of contents and whether those derivatives may be expected to remain highly effective in future periods 
if it is determined that a derivative is not or has ceased to be highly effective as a hedge  we discontinue hedge accounting 
when we discontinue hedge accounting  the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into income when the forecasted transaction affects income 
in all situations in which hedge accounting is discontinued and the derivative remains outstanding  we will carry the derivative at its fair value on the balance sheet  recognizing changes in the fair value in current period income 
for purposes of the cash flow statement  cash flows from derivative instruments are classified with the cash flows from the hedged item 
in connection with its loan acquisitions  belvedere trust enters into forward loan purchase commitments 
to mitigate the impact of rising interest rates on the consummation of forward loan purchase commitments in connection with planned securitization funding  belvedere trust may enter into eurodollar futures transactions 
both of these are treated as derivatives  carried at fair value  and any changes in fair value are recognized in current period income 
residential real estate loans we acquire residential mortgage loans and hold them as long term investments through our belvedere trust subsidiary 
we finance the mortgage loans with short term debt see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements until a sufficient quantity has been accumulated for securitization into mbs in order to obtain long term financing and to enhance liquidity 
while all mortgage loans are acquired with the intention of securitizing them  we may not be successful in our efforts to securitize the loans into mbs 
our residential real estate loans are classified as held for investment and are carried at their unpaid principal balance  adjusted for unamortized premiums or discounts 
premiums or discounts are amortized into current operations using the effective interest yield method  as adjusted for actual prepayments and considering estimated future prepayments  based on sfas to meet our investment criteria  mortgage loans acquired by us will generally conform to the underwriting guidelines established by freddie mac  fannie mae and ginnie mae  or to secondary market standards for high credit quality mortgage loans 
applicable banking laws generally require that an appraisal be obtained in connection with the original issuance of mortgage loans by the lending institution and we do not intend to obtain additional appraisals at the time of acquiring mortgage loans 
mortgage loans may be originated by or purchased from various suppliers of mortgage related assets throughout the united states including savings and loan associations  banks  mortgage bankers and other mortgage lenders 
we may acquire mortgage loans directly from originators and from entities holding mortgage loans originated by others 
belvedere trust maintains an allowance for loan losses for residential real estate loans held in consolidated securitization trusts and for loans held prior to securitization 
the balance is included in allowance for loan losses on the consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes other than bt finance  as noted below  our financial results do not reflect provisions for current or deferred income taxes 
management believes that we have and intend to continue to operate in a manner that will continue to allow us to be taxed as a reit and  as a result  does not expect to pay substantial corporate level taxes 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to federal income tax 
bt finance  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary  is a taxable reit subsidiary and may be liable for corporate income tax expenses 

table of contents subsequent events on february and   we issued an aggregate of million shares of series b preferred stock and received net proceeds of approximately million net of underwriting fees  commissions and other costs 
the shares have a liquidation value of per share and will pay cash dividends at a rate of per year of the liquidation preference 
the conversion rate will initially be shares of our common stock per share of series b preferred stock 
the conversion rate will be adjusted in any fiscal quarter in which the cash dividends paid to common stockholders results in an annualized common dividend yield which is greater than 
the conversion ratio will also be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain specific events such as a change of control 
we intend to classify the series b preferred stock as temporary equity  which we believe follows the guidance of emerging issues task force eitf topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities 
the series b preferred stock contains certain fundamental change provisions that allow the holder to redeem the preferred stock for cash only if certain events occur 
as redemption under these circumstances is not solely within our control  we believe the guidance specifies the treatment of these securities as temporary equity 
we have also analyzed whether the conversion features in the series b preferred stock should be bifurcated under the guidance in fas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock and have determined that these do not need to be bifurcated 
since december   we have entered into five additional swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million for terms of up to three years 
we utilize swap agreements to manage interest rate risk 
in accordance with these swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest during the term of the swap agreements and receive a payment that varies with the three month libor rate 
in february  belvedere trust sold one of its interest only securities for approximately million 
at december   we wrote down the value of this security from an amortized cost of approximately million to its fair value of approximately million 
this write down of approximately thousand was reflected in impairment charges 
based on the sales price of approximately million  belvedere trust recorded in february an additional loss of approximately thousand on the sale of this security 
in addition to the sale of this security  during january and february  belvedere trust sold six other securities from its bt other mbs portfolio  having a fair value at december  of approximately million 
belvedere trust expects to recognize a gain on the sale of these six securities of approximately million 
belvedere trust sold all of these securities as part of its asset liability management program in order to reduce its credit risk exposure and to minimize future volatility to its earnings 

table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we seek to manage the interest rate  market value  liquidity  prepayment and credit risks inherent in all financial institutions in a prudent manner designed to insure our longevity while  at the same time  seeking to provide an opportunity for stockholders to realize attractive total rates of return through ownership of our common stock 
while we do not seek to avoid risk completely  we do seek  to the best of our ability  to assume risk that can be quantified from historical experience  to actively manage that risk  to earn sufficient compensation to justify taking those risks and to maintain capital levels consistent with the risks we undertake 
interest rate risk we primarily invest in adjustable rate  hybrid and fixed rate mortgage related assets 
hybrid mortgages are arms that have a fixed interest rate for an initial period of time typically three years or greater and then convert to an adjustable rate for the remaining loan term 
our debt obligations are generally repurchase agreements of limited duration that are periodically refinanced at current market rates 
arm related assets are typically subject to periodic and lifetime interest rate caps that limit the amount an arm related asset s interest rate can change during any given period 
arm securities are also typically subject to a minimum interest rate payable 
our borrowings are not subject to similar restrictions 
hence  in a period of increasing interest rates  interest rates on our borrowings could increase without limitation  while the interest rates on our mortgage related assets could be limited 
this problem would be magnified to the extent we acquire mortgage related assets that are not fully indexed 
further  some arm related assets may be subject to periodic payment caps that result in some portion of the interest being deferred and added to the principal outstanding 
these factors could lower our net interest income or cause a net loss during periods of rising interest rates  which would negatively impact our liquidity  net income and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we fund the purchase of a substantial portion of our arm related assets with borrowings that have interest rates based on indices and repricing terms similar to  but of somewhat shorter maturities than  the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets 
thus  we anticipate that in most cases the interest rate indices and repricing terms of our mortgage assets and our funding sources will not be identical  thereby creating an interest rate mismatch between assets and liabilities 
during periods of changing interest rates  such interest rate mismatches could negatively impact our net interest income  dividend yield and the market price of our common stock 
most of our adjustable rate assets are based on the one year constant maturity treasury rate and the one year libor rate and our debt obligations are generally based on libor 
these indices generally move in the same direction  but there can be no assurance that this will continue to occur 
our arm related assets and borrowings reset at various different dates for the specific asset or obligation 
in general  the repricing of our debt obligations occurs more quickly than on our assets 
therefore  on average  our cost of funds may rise or fall more quickly than does our earnings rate on the assets 
further  our net income may vary somewhat as the spread between one month interest rates and six and twelve month interest rates varies

belvedere trust has implemented an interest rate risk management program intended to protect its portfolio of mortgage related assets and the related debt against the effects of major interest rate changes 
belvedere trust primarily uses securitization transactions to manage the interest rate risk of its mortgage portfolio 
the payments due on the securities generally match the cash flow from the underlying mortgage loans 
belvedere trust s interest rate risk management program is formulated with the intent to offset  to some extent  the potential adverse effects resulting from rate adjustment limitations on its portfolio of mortgage related assets and the differences between interest rate adjustment indices and interest rate adjustment periods of its adjustable rate mortgage related assets and related borrowings 
belvedere trust finances certain of its retained and acquired securities with repurchase agreements which have different adjustment periods than the related assets 
as part of its interest rate risk management program  belvedere trust has entered into term repurchase agreements that fix the rate of interest or  in some cases  cap the rate of interest on a portion of the borrowings secured by belvedere trust s mortgage related assets 
market value risk substantially all of our mbs are classified as available for sale assets 
as such  they are reflected at fair value ie  market value with the periodic adjustment to fair value reflected as part of accumulated other comprehensive income that is included in the equity section of our balance sheet 
the market value of our assets can fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and other factors 
liquidity risk our primary liquidity risk arises from financing long maturity mbs with short term debt 
the interest rates on our borrowings generally adjust more frequently than the interest rates on our adjustable rate mbs 
for example  at december   our agency and non agency adjustable rate mbs had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of approximately months  while our borrowings had a weighted average term to next rate adjustment of days 
after adjusting for interest rate swap transactions  the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
accordingly  in a period of rising interest rates  our borrowing costs will usually increase faster than our interest earnings from mbs 
as a result  we could experience a decrease in net income or a net loss during these periods as what has occurred in 
our assets that are pledged to secure short term borrowings are high quality liquid assets 
as a result  we have not had difficulty rolling over our short term borrowings as they mature 
there can be no assurance that we will always be able to roll over our short term debt 

table of contents at december   we had unrestricted cash of thousand  million in unpledged agency and non agency mbs and million in unpledged bt other mbs available to meet margin calls on short term borrowings that could be caused by asset value declines or changes in lender collateralization requirements 
prepayment risk prepayments are the full or partial repayment of principal prior to the original term to maturity of a mortgage loan and typically occur due to refinancing of mortgage loans 
prepayment rates on mortgage related securities and mortgage loans vary from time to time and may cause changes in the amount of our net interest income 
prepayments of arm loans usually can be expected to increase when mortgage interest rates fall below the then current interest rates on such loans and decrease when mortgage interest rates exceed the then current interest rate on such loans  although such effects are not entirely predictable 
prepayment rates may also be affected by the conditions in the housing and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on fixed rate loans and arm loans underlying mbs 
the purchase prices of mbs are generally based upon assumptions regarding the expected amounts and rates of prepayments 
where slow prepayment assumptions are made  we may pay a premium for mbs 
to the extent such assumptions differ from the actual amounts of prepayments  we could experience reduced earnings or losses 
the total prepayment of any mbs purchased at a premium by us would result in the immediate write off of any remaining capitalized premium amount and a reduction of our net interest income by such amount 
finally  in the event that we are unable to acquire new mbs to replace the prepaid mbs  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations could be harmed 
we often purchase mortgage related assets that have a higher interest rate than the market interest rate at the time 
in exchange for this higher interest rate  we must pay a premium over par value to acquire these assets 
in accordance with accounting rules  we amortize this premium over the term of the mortgage backed security 
as we receive repayments of mortgage principal  we amortize the premium balances as a reduction to our income 
if the mortgage loans underlying a mortgage backed security were prepaid at a faster rate than we anticipate  we would amortize the premium at a faster rate 
this would reduce our income 
tabular presentation anworth s mbs portfolio the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net interest income and projected portfolio value excluding belvedere trust s operations as more fully discussed below  based on investments in place at december   and includes all of our interest rate sensitive assets  liabilities and hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
changes in projected net interest income equals the change that would occur in the calculated projected net interest income for the next twelve months relative to the change scenario if interest rates were to instantaneously parallel shift to and remain at the stated level for the next twelve months 
changes in projected portfolio value equals the change in value of our assets that we carry at fair value rather than at historical amortized cost and any change in the value of any derivative instruments or hedges  such as interest rate swap agreements 
we acquire interest rate sensitive assets and fund them with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we generally plan to retain such assets and the associated interest rate risk to maturity 
change in interest rates percentage change in projected net interest income percentage change in projected portfolio value 
table of contents when interest rates are shocked  prepayment assumptions are adjusted based on management s best estimate of the effects of changes in interest rates on prepayment speeds 
for example  under current market conditions  a basis point decline in interest rates is estimated to result in a increase in the prepayment rate of our agency mbs portfolio 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december  actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
the above table includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements 
at december   the aggregate notional amount of the interest rate swap agreements was million and the weighted average maturity was years 
the information presented in the table below projects the impact of sudden changes in interest rates on anworth s annual projected net income and projected portfolio value compared to the base case used in the table above excluding belvedere trust s operations and excludes the effect of the interest rate swap agreements

the results of interest rate shocks of plus and minus and basis points are presented 
the cash flows associated with the portfolio of mortgage related assets for each rate shock are calculated based on a variety of assumptions including prepayment speeds  time until coupon reset  yield on future acquisitions  slope of the yield curve and size of the portfolio 
assumptions made on the interest rate sensitive liabilities  which are repurchase agreements  include anticipated interest rates no negative rates are utilized  collateral requirements as a percent of the repurchase agreement and amount of borrowing 
assumptions made in calculating the impact on net asset value of interest rate shocks include interest rates  prepayment rates and the yield spread of mortgage related assets relative to prevailing interest rates
