a summary of the company s critical accounting policies follows revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the determination of whether the collectibility is reasonably assured is based upon an assessment of the creditworthiness of the customers 
in instances where the collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  the revenue and related costs are deferred

license revenue allocated to software products generally is recognized upon delivery of the products or deferred and recognized in future periods to the extent that an arrangement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and for which fair values have not been established 
revenue allocated to maintenance is recognized ratably over the maintenance term which is typically twelve months and revenue allocated to training and other service elements  such as implementation and training  are recognized as the services are performed 
under sop no 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered element and recognized as revenue

every quarter  stock rotation rights are limited to a percentage of invoiced sales to the distributor in the prior quarter 
the percentage of sales used to determine the stock rotation right is based upon the terms of the executed distributor agreements with the company 
the company reduces revenue and maintains a reserve for an estimate of potential stock rotation returns related to the current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  channel inventory levels  current economic trends and changes in customer demand for the company s products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for stock rotation returns 
the company routinely analyzes and establishes  as necessary  reserves at the time of shipment for product returns and allowances and warranty costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
considerable judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the creditworthiness of each customer 
the evaluation is based on credit information and collection history concerning the customer up and through the 
table of contents determination date 
the company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a specific review of outstanding customer balances and a general reserve based upon aging of customer accounts and write off history 
inventory obsolescence the company is required to state its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  the company makes judgments as to future demand requirements and compares that with the current and committed inventory levels 
the company has recorded changes in net realizable values in recent periods due to the impact of current and future technology trends and changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as  changes in market conditions due to changes in demand requirements

the accrual for one of the leases with total payments remaining through january  of million is offset by sublease receipts totaling  through the end of the lease term and assumes an amount of  for the extension of one of the subleases through the end of the lease term 
as of december   the company had a remaining balance of approximately million in liabilities of discontinued operations 
the company currently believes that this remaining balance is sufficient to cover estimated future obligations associated with the restructurings  however  changes in these estimates could occur based on changes in the financial condition of the subleases 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance the company currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessment 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is principally dependant upon achievement of projected future taxable income 
the company s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to market conditions  its ability to continue to successfully execute its strategic plan and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to recognize the entire tax benefit of the deferred tax assets  the company has established an offsetting provision 
litigation and related contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to labor  product and other matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as  potential ranges of probable losses

the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters
