december  in thousands consolidated balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents working capital total assets total stockholders equity item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that management believes are reasonable based upon the information available 
we base these estimates on our historical experience  future expectations and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates and assumptions relate to estimates of collectibility of accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and any differences could be material 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the reported consolidated financial results include the following revenue recognition liveperson helps to maximize the business impact of the online channel as a provider of hosted software that enables customers to proactively assist their online visitors 
our proprietary tools and methodology have been proven to increase sales  customer satisfaction and loyalty while reducing customer service costs 
our fully integrated multi channel communications platform  timpani  facilitates real time sales  marketing and customer service 
our technology supports and manages key online interactions via chat  voice  email and self service knowledgebase in a cost effective and secure environment 
we charge a monthly fee  which varies by service and client usage 
the majority of our larger clients also pay us a professional services fee related to implementation 
we may also charge professional service fees related to additional training  business consulting and analysis in support of the liveperson services 
the proportion of our new clients that are large corporations is increasing 
these companies typically have more significant implementation requirements and more stringent data security standards 
as a result  our professional services revenue has begun to increase 
such clients also have more sophisticated data analysis and performance reporting requirements  and are more likely to engage our professional services organization to provide such analysis and reporting on a recurring basis 
as a result  it is likely that a greater proportion of our future revenue will be generated from such ongoing professional services work 
we also sell certain of the liveperson services directly via internet download 
these services are marketed as liveperson pro and liveperson contact center for small and mid sized businesses smbs  and are paid for almost exclusively by credit card 
credit card payments accelerate cash flow and reduce our collection risk  subject to the merchant bank s right to hold back cash pending settlement of the transactions 
sales of liveperson pro and liveperson contact center may occur with or without the assistance of an online sales representative  rather than through face to face or telephone contact that is typically required for traditional direct sales 
we record revenue based upon the monthly fee charged for the liveperson services  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we recognize monthly service fees as services are provided 
our service agreements typically have twelve month terms and are terminable upon to days notice without penalty 
we recognize professional service fees upon completion and customer acceptance of key milestones within each professional services engagement 
professional services to date have not been significant 
in the past  certain of our larger clients  who required more sophisticated implementation and training  may have paid an initial non refundable set up fee 
this fee was intended to recover certain costs principally customer service  training and other administrative costs prior to deployment of the liveperson services 
as of december   we had approximately  of unamortized deferred set up fees which are expected to be recognized ratably through march stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  with a primary focus on transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas no 
r is a revision to sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related implementation guidance 
sfas no 
r requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income 
stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated statement of income for the year december  includes compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to  but not fully vested as of january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
as well as compensation expense for share based awards granted subsequent to january  in accordance with sfas no 
r 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine grant date fair value 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
accounts receivable our customers are primarily concentrated in the united states 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition except for customers who purchase the liveperson services by credit card via internet download and have established an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of customers  historical trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable  although they may change in the future 
if there is a deterioration of a customer s credit worthiness or actual write offs are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of recoverability for these receivables could be adversely affected 
our concentration of credit risk is limited due to the large number of customers 
no single customer accounted for or exceeded of our total revenue in  and no single customer accounted for or exceeded of accounts receivable at december  or accounts receivable at december  increased by approximately  net of the proficient acquisition  compared to december   due primarily to an increase in the proportion of receivables due from larger corporate clients that typically have longer payment practices 
this increase and the acquisition of proficient resulted in an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts of  in the year ended december  goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but reviewed for impairment upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would reduce the fair value below its carrying amount 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit including unrecognized intangible assets under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
similarly  estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
to assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment  we will obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
in addition to the use of an independent valuation firm  we will perform internal valuation analyses and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and market comparisons 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows including timing  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables and the determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying value of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
use of estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period 
significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include the carrying amount of goodwill  intangibles  stock based compensation  valuation allowances for deferred income tax assets  accounts receivable  the expected term of a client relationship  accruals and other factors 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  fasb interpretation fin no

the adoption of fin no
