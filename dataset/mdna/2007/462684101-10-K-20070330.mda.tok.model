our dermatology products are primarily used in a dermatologist or plastic surgeon s office and contributed million  million  and million to our total revenues in  and  respectively 
in january  the company acquired laserscope s aesthetics business including its subsidiaries in france and the united kingdom uk from american medical systems holdings ams 
laserscope aesthetic treatments encompass minimally invasive surgical techniques for hair removal  leg veins  wrinkle removal  acne damage  sun damage and skin rejuvenation 
these procedures are usually not performed in an operating room and are therefore paid for by patients without the assistance of any insurance or medicare reimbursement 
laserscope s aesthetic products include the gemini laser system  venus i laser systems  lyra i laser system  aura i laser system featuring starpulse and solis ipl system 
lasersope s delivery devices versastat i smartscan plus  smartscan  coolspot  dermastats and micronspot dermastats 
the iridex ophthalmic and dermatology laser system  exclusive of the laserscope products  consist of small  portable laser consoles and delivery devices 
while dermatologists almost always use our laser systems in their offices  ophthalmologists and plastic surgeons typically use our laser systems in hospital operating rooms or and ambulatory surgical centers asc  as well as their offices 
in the or and asc  ophthalmologists use our laser with either an indirect laser ophthalmoscope or a disposable  single use endoprobe 
our business includes a recurring revenue component which includes the sales of the disposable  single use laser probes  endoprobes  combined with the repair  servicing and extended warranty protection for our laser systems 
since our first shipment in  more than  iridex medical laser systems  both ophthalmic and dermatology  have been sold worldwide 
iridex corporation was incorporated in california in february as iris medical instruments  inc in  we changed our name to iridex corporation and reincorporated in delaware

the iridex strategy we are one of the worldwide leaders in developing  manufacturing  marketing  selling and servicing innovative medical laser systems 
we have three key elements in our strategy leveraging our core business and increasing recurring revenues in our ophthalmology business  broadening our product lines through product innovation  and developing new market opportunities through strategic alliances  oem relationships and acquisitions including the successful integration of the aesthetics business of laserscope 
leverage our core business and increase recurring revenues 
we believe that we can continue to grow our current installed base of more than  iridex laser systems worldwide 
with the initiatives of our expanded sales and marketing team  we expect to grow our current product offerings in laser systems  delivery devices and disposables 
despite the fact that the majority of our sales are in a competitive replacement market  the features of our laser systems combined with our large installed laser base as well as our new product innovations should allow us to increase our market share 

table of contents our recurring revenue includes the sale of our disposable  single use laser probes  endoprobes  combined with the repair  servicing and extended warranty protection for our laser systems 
in recurring revenues were of the overall business up from in and in with our increased sales force and new marketing programs  we believe that there is an opportunity to significantly increase our recurring revenues over the next several years 
our new sales programs include an increased number of domestic area sales managers from to focused on the entire ophthalmic product offering and whose incentive plan is more focused on the recurring revenue opportunity  particularly laser probe sales 
our new us marketing programs include a vip valued iridex partner program that allows customers to access additional iridex products based upon the purchase of disposable laser probes 
during the past two years  we have introduced many different types of endoprobes into the market  including our stepped  intuitive and illuminating probes 
when a customer purchases our laser system  a warranty is included 
in addition  we market extended warranty protection plans which can be purchased at the time of the product acquisition or after the expiration of the original warranty 
we also repair products out of warranty under a program which allows our customer to obtain a laser overnight while their unit is returned for repair 
the customer is charged a reasonable fee for these services 
broaden product lines through product innovation 
one of our core strengths has been the introduction at regular intervals of new laser systems  delivery devices including disposable probes and product upgrades to enhance the benefits of our laser systems 
we attempt to leverage the knowledge and know how of our existing products and technology when developing new products 
in october  we introduced the easyfit family of portable slit lamp adapters or slas  which allow for improved viewing clarity of the retina by the physician 
in october  we introduced the oculight symphony laser delivery system which combines the clinical versatility and convenience of infrared and visible photocoagulation consoles into one delivery device 
we also introduced an expanded endoprobe product line and a millimeter large spot slit lamp adapter 
in december  we commenced shipment of the millennium endolase module  which we manufacture to be included in bausch lomb s millennium microsurgical system 
in  we introduced a micron spot slit lamp adapter  the smallest spot size diameter available on iridex slit lamp adapters 
in addition  in and the first quarter of  we introduced four additions to our endoprobe product line 
in  we launched a new  menu driven infrared platform for ophthalmology  the iq  designed to allow easier physician access to a variety of advanced laser energy delivery modes used to perform minimum intensity photocoagulation mip procedures 
for the dermatology market  we introduced the varilite  a dual wavelength laser in the fourth quarter of that offers both high power nm and nm wavelengths for added clinical versatility and convenience for the physician 
in  we continued to expand our disposable endoprobe product line with new designs in stepped probes  intuitive probes and illuminating probes 
in  we also launched the diolite xp laser which is a high power nm wavelength laser system and scanlite xp scanner for dermatological applications 
in at the american academy of ophthalmology aao we introduced two new laser systems the oculight tx  a new green light laser with an optional remote control and wireless foot switch 
this first shipped in late  and the first true yellow nm laser system which requires fda approval and is currently scheduled to ship in mid we intend to continue our investment in research and product innovation to improve the performance of our systems and broaden our product offerings 
we also intend to develop innovative technologies which can address the customer needs of the ophthalmic and aesthetic markets 

table of contents develop new market opportunities through strategic acquisitions and alliances 
in january  we acquired the aesthetics business of laserscope from ams to complement the laser systems that iridex has been selling to dermatologists and plastic surgeons since in addition to having a strong presence in the offices of dermatologists and plastic surgeons  the laserscope products have primarily been sold to general practitioners and ob gyn doctors 
the iridex dermatology products treat skin conditions  primarily vascular and pigmented lesions while laserscope product treatments encompass minimally invasive surgical techniques for hair removal  leg veins  wrinkle removal  acne damage  sun damage and skin rejuvenation 
the successful integration of the laserscope aesthetics business will be one of the major objectives of our management team in we have negotiated a supply agreement with ams to provide us with laserscope products for up to a nine month period ending october  however  we plan to integrate the manufacture of the laserscope products into our mountain view facility within a shorter period of time 
in addition we have already transitioned the customer service and support functions related to the laserscope products to our existing facility in mountain view 
in order to achieve the desired level of growth  we must explore opportunities to acquire technologies or companies which strategically fit our current core competencies 
we have an excellent reputation  within the retinal segment of ophthalmology  as a company with innovative and reliable technology combined with responsive customer service 
given the level of management experience within the company and the size of the market opportunity  an acquisition within ophthalmology would be a good fit strategically 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we depend on collaborative relationships to develop  introduce and market new products  product enhancements and new applications 
products we utilize a systems approach to product design 
each system includes a console  which generates the laser energy  and a number of interchangeable peripheral delivery devices  including disposable delivery devices  for use in specific clinical applications 
this approach allows our customers to purchase a basic console system and add additional delivery devices as their needs expand or as new applications develop 
we believe that this systems approach is a distinguishing characteristic and also brings economies of scale to our product development and manufacturing efforts because individual applications do not require the design and manufacture of complete stand alone products 
our primary non disposable products range in price from  to  and consist of laser consoles and specialized delivery devices and our line of disposable products has list prices of between and to end customers 
consoles our laser consoles incorporate the economic and technical benefits of semiconductor laser technology 
infrared photocoagulator consoles 
these oculight and iq photocoagulator consoles used by ophthalmologists are available in two infrared nm output power ranges the oculight sl at watts and the iq and oculight slx at watts 
each console weighs pounds  has dimensions of h x w x d  and requires no external air or water cooling 
we believe that the smaller overall sizes  lower weights and low power requirements to operate represent distinct advantages over competing products 

table of contents visible or green photocoagulator consoles 
our oculight tx  or  gl and oculight glx semiconductor based photocoagulator consoles used in ophthalmology deliver visible nm laser light 
the oculight tx was first shipped in late and offers an optional remote control and wireless footswitch 
the oculight glx has increased power and delivery device capability 
our visible laser light dermatology products  the diolite xp and varilite are also based on semiconductor based technology 
the oculight or gl glx diolite xp diolite consoles weigh pounds  have dimensions of h x w x d  draw a maximum of watts of wall power and require no external air or water cooling 
in december  we commenced shipment of the millennium endolase module  which is sold exclusively to bausch lomb for use in their millennium microsurgical system 
it integrates nm photocoagulator capability into bausch lomb s array of microsurgical capabilities for the vitrectomy procedure 
the millennium endolase module is compatible with the iridex disposable endoprobe handpieces and laser indirect ophthalmoscope 
combination infrared visible photocoagulator consoles 
the oculight symphony laser delivery system  is used by ophthalmologists and consists of an oculight slx infrared nm laser console  oculight glx green nm laser console  multi fiber slit lamp adapter  slit lamp and a custom cart 
the oculight symphony laser delivery system combines the clinical versatility and convenience of a nm  nm and large spot nm into one delivery device for retinal photocoagulation and glaucoma procedures 
our varilite product which is used in dermatology is a dual wavelength combination of nm and infrared nm 
the varilite wavelength can be changed with just a simple flip of a single switch and can be used in conjunction with the scanlite as well as several different sized handpieces 
we believe that this product offers a unique value added proposition and the efficiency of dual laser wavelength delivery in a single product 
specialized delivery devices 
our versatile family of consoles and delivery devices has been designed to accommodate the addition of new capabilities with a minimal incremental investment 
users of this product can add capabilities by simply purchasing new interchangeable delivery devices and utilizing them with their existing console 
we have developed both disposable and nondisposable delivery devices and expect to continue to develop additional devices 
ophthalmic delivery devices trufocus laser indirect ophthalmoscope lio 
the indirect ophthalmoscope is designed to be worn on the physician s head and to be used in procedures to treat peripheral retinal disorders  particularly in infants or adults requiring treatment in the supine position 
this product can be used in both diagnosis and treatment procedures at the point of care 
slit lamp adapter sla 
these adapters allow the physician to utilize a standard slit lamp in both diagnosis and treatment procedures 
doctors can install a slit lamp adapter in a few minutes and convert standard diagnostic slit lamps into a therapeutic photocoagulator delivery system 
slit lamp adapters are used in treatment procedures for both retinal diseases and glaucoma 
these devices are available in a wide variety of spot diameters 
in  we introduced a micron spot slit lamp adapter  a reduction in the smallest spot size diameter available on iridex slit lamp adapters 
operating microscope adapter 
these adapters allow the physician to utilize a standard operating microscope in both diagnosis and laser treatment procedures 
these devices are similar to slit lamp adapters  except that they are oriented horizontally and therefore can be used to deliver retinal photocoagulation to a supine patient 
endoprobe 
the endoprobe or laser probe is used for endophotocoagulation  a retinal treatment procedure performed in the hospital operating room or surgery center during a vitrectomy procedure 
these sterile disposable probes are available in tapered  angled  fluted  illuminating  stepped  endoocular and intuitive styles 
g probe 
the g probe is used in procedures to treat medically and surgically uncontrolled glaucoma  in many instances replacing cyclocryotherapy  or freezing of the eye 
the g probe s non invasive procedure takes approximately ten minutes  is done to an anesthetized eye in the doctor s office and results in less pain and fewer adverse side effects than cyclocryotherapy 
the g probe is a sterile disposable product 

table of contents diopexy probe 
the diopexy probe is a hand held instrument which is used in procedures to treat retinal tears and breaks  non invasively through the sclera  as an alternative method of attaching the retina 
our diopexy probe results in increased precision  less pain and less inflammation than traditional cryotherapy

table of contents research and product innovation we have close working relationships with researchers  clinicians and practicing physicians around the world who provide new ideas  test the feasibility of these new ideas and assist us in validating new products and new applications before they are introduced 
our product innovation group formerly known as product development activities are performed by a current team of engineers with an average of years of experience each in medical products  laser systems and delivery devices 
the core competencies of the team include mechanical engineering  electrical engineering  optics  software  firmware and delivery devices 
the team is being transitioned with a focus to introduce innovative products which satisfy the unmet and emerging needs of our customers 
their approach is a rapid product development process which integrates all the necessary disciplines of the company from product inception through customer acceptance 
this approach should allow for rapid and reliable new product innovations and a consistent pipeline of innovative products for our customers 
our research activities are performed internally by our research staff 
from time to time  we supplement our internal research staff by hiring consultants and or partnering with universities to gain specialized expertise 
research efforts are directed toward the development of new products and new applications for our existing products  as well as the identification of markets which may include clinical trials and may not be currently addressed by our products 
we believe that it is important to make a substantial contribution to the treatment of serious eye diseases such as age related macular degeneration  diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma 
the objectives of developing new photocoagluation treatments and applications are to expand the number of patients who can be treated  to more effectively treat diseases  to treat patients earlier in the treatment regimen and to reduce the sideeffects of treatment 
examples of such studies with regard to particular eye afflictions are included in the following paragraphs 
age related macular degeneration amd wet form 
amd is a progressive disease that damages the central vision and affects a person s ability to read  see faces  and drive 
about million people worldwide have amd and  of these  about million have the more severe wet form 
though the wet form of amd constitutes about of all amd  it accounts for about of all severe vision loss associated with amd 
we are pursuing several approaches to treat wet amd at different stages 
all of these approaches close new blood vessels in the eye s macula caused by wet amd with less damage than conventional laser treatments 
age related macular degeneration dry form 
about of amd is the dry form 
our approach to the treatment of dry amd is to preserve or improve vision by following a mip protocol that uses the oculight infrared laser to cause resorption of dry amd deposits drusen which have accumulated in the macula 
we have supported a multi center clinical trial which is testing a treatment of eyes with dry age related macular degeneration ptamd trial 
glaucoma 
preliminary studies are underway to evaluate the use of the g probe as a primary surgical treatment modality for glaucoma in various parts of the world 
diabetic retinopathy 
other mip studies are underway to investigate the treatment of diabetic retinopathy using the micropulse operating mode available in our oculight slx product with the objective of causing regression of the disease with less loss of vision than conventional laser therapy 
ocular tumors 
clinical studies have reported successful treatment of ocular tumors using oculight infrared lasers using the ttt approach 
all of these clinical projects should be considered in the research area and they may or may not result in additional commercial opportunities 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we are dependent on the successful outcome of clinical trials of our products and new applications using our products 

table of contents customers and customer support our products are currently sold to ophthalmologists  particularly those specializing in retina  glaucoma and pediatrics  dermatologists and plastic surgeons 
other customers include research and teaching hospitals  government installations  surgical centers and hospitals 
no customer or distributor accounted for or more of total sales in any of  or see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we are continuing our efforts to broaden our customer base through the development of new products and new applications of our existing products for use by ophthalmologists and dermatologists 
we currently estimate that there are approximately  ophthalmologists in the united states and  internationally who are each potential customers 
additionally  we estimate that there are approximately  and  hospitals in the united states and internationally  respectively  as well as approximately  ambulatory surgical centers in the united states which potentially represent multiple unit sales 
we believe there are approximately  dermatologists and approximately  plastic surgeons in the united states who are potential customers 
because independent ophthalmologists and dermatologists frequently practice at their own offices as well as through affiliation with hospitals or other medical centers  each independent ophthalmologist  dermatologist  plastic surgeon  office  hospital and medical center is a potential customer for our products 
we are seeking to broaden our customer base by developing new products directed at addressing the needs of ophthalmologists and dermatologists 
we seek to provide superior customer support and service and therefore created our global customer care group chartered with the responsibility for handling customer requests and product repairs  which has resulted in a significant improvement in our response times to customer support and service issues 
we believe that our superior customer service and technical support distinguish our product offerings from those of our competitors 
our customer support representatives assist customers with orders  warranty returns and other administrative functions 
our technical support engineers provide customers with answers to technical and product related questions 
we maintain an around the clock telephone service line to service our customers 
if a problem with a product cannot be diagnosed and resolved by telephone  a replacement unit is shipped overnight to any domestic customer and by the most rapid delivery means available to any international customer  and the problem unit is returned to us 
the small size and rugged design of our products allows for economical shipment and quick response to customers almost anywhere in the world 
sales and marketing we market our products in the united states predominantly through our direct sales force 
our direct sales force is separated into two separate divisions  one for ophthalmology and one for aesthetics 
in total we have a direct sales force of employees who are engaged in sales efforts within the united states as of december  our sales and marketing organization is based at our corporate headquarters in mountain view  california with area sales managers located throughout the united states 
international product sales represented  and of our sales in  and  respectively 
we believe that our international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our international sales are made principally to customers in europe  asia  pacific rim  middle east and latin america 
our products are sold internationally through our independent distributors into countries 
international sales are administered through our corporate headquarters in mountain view  california 
our distribution agreements with our international distributors are generally exclusive and typically can be terminated by either party without cause with days notice 
international sales may be adversely affected by the imposition of governmental controls  currency fluctuations  restrictions on export technology  political instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and the economic condition in each country in which we sell our products 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we depend on international sales 

table of contents to support our sales process we conduct marketing programs which include direct mail  trade shows  public relations  market research  and advertising in trade and academic journals and newsletters 
we annually participate in over trade shows internationally 
these meetings allow us to present our products to existing and prospective buyers 
one of our new marketing programs designed to help us reach our goal of increasing our recurring revenues  includes a vip valued iridex partner program which allows customers to access additional iridex products through a contractual agreement on the purchase of disposable laser probes 
in  recurring revenues including sales of endoprobes and service revenue were of the overall business up from in during the past two years  we have introduced many specialty types of endoprobes into the market  including our new stepped  intuitive and illuminating probes 
we believe that educating patients and physicians at an early stage about the long term health benefits and cost effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment of diseases that cause blindness is critical to market acceptance of our ophthalmic products 
the trend toward management of health care costs in the united states should lead to increased awareness of and early intervention of disease management with cost effective treatments and  as a result  will increase demand for our ophthalmic products 
our marketing efforts are made to promote the education of our customers on these topics 
through marketing  we collaborate with our customers to enhance our ability to identify new applications for our products  validate new procedures using our products and identify new product applications which help meet their unmet needs 
customers include key opinion leaders who are often the heads of the departments in which they work or professors at universities 
we believe that these luminaries in the field of ophthalmology and dermatology are key to the successful introduction of new products and the subsequent acceptance of these new products by the general market 
acceptance of our products by these early adopters is key to our strategy in the validation and commercialization of our new products 
operations the manufacture of our infrared and visible light photocoagulators and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
completed systems must pass quality control and reliability tests before shipment 
our manufacturing activities consist of specifying  sourcing  assembling and testing of components and certain subassemblies for assembly into our final product 
as of december   we had a total of employees engaged in manufacturing activities 
the medical devices manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including federal  state  and foreign governmental agencies 
the principal regulator in the united states is the food and drug administration the fda 
in april  we received certification for iso en iso en is a documented international quality system standard that documents compliance to the european medical device directive 
in february  we were certified to iso which replaced iso en as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  although we assemble critical subassemblies and the final product at our facility in mountain view  california 
some of these suppliers and manufacturers are sole source 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase most components on a purchase order basis 
these components may not be available in the quantities required  on reasonable terms  or at all 
financial or other difficulties faced by our suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability 
any failures by such third parties to adequately perform may delay the submission of products for regulatory approval  impair our ability to deliver products on a timely basis or otherwise impair our competitive position 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we face risks of manufacturing and we depend on key manufacturers and suppliers 

table of contents international regulatory bodies often establish varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce marked  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance to the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
in july  we received ce mark under annex ii guidelines  the most stringent path to ce certification 
with annex ii ce certification  we have demonstrated our ability to both understand and comply with all applicable european standards 
this allows us to ce mark any product upon our internal verification of compliance to all applicable european standards 
currently  all released products are ce marked 
continued certification is based on successful review of the process by our european registrar during its annual audit 
any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we are subject to government regulation 
competition competition in the market for laser systems and delivery devices used for ophthalmic and dermatology treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
this market is also characterized by rapid technological innovation and change  and our products could become obsolete as a result of future innovations 
our competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
in addition to other companies that manufacture photocoagulators and dermatological devices  we compete with pharmaceutical solutions  other technologies and other surgical techniques available in both the dermatologic and ophthalmic markets 
our principal competitors in ophthalmology are lumenis ltd  nidek  inc  carl zeiss meditec ag  alcon inc 
and synergetics 
all of these companies currently offer a competitive  semiconductor based laser system for ophthalmology 
also within ophthalmology pharmaceutical alternative treatments for amd such as lucentis genentech  and to a lesser extent visudyne novartis and macugen eyetech compete rigorously with traditional laser procedures 
our principal competitors in dermatology are palomar technologies  candela corporation  syneron  and lumenis ltd 
some competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
some companies also have greater name recognition than us and long standing customer relationships 
in addition  other medical companies  academic and research institutions  or others  may develop new technologies or therapies  including medical devices  surgical procedures or pharmacological treatments and obtain regulatory approval for products utilizing such techniques that are more effective in treating the conditions targeted by us  or are less expensive than our current or future products 
our technologies and products could be rendered obsolete by such developments 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results our market is competitive 
patents and proprietary rights our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued united states patents and five foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes  which have expiration dates ranging from to we have approximately five pending patent applications in the united states and five foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we rely on patents and proprietary rights 

table of contents government regulation the medical devices to be marketed and manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities  including federal  state  and foreign governmental agencies 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  as amended  and the regulations promulgated thereunder the fda act  the fda serves as the principal federal agency within the united states with authority over medical devices and regulates the research  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  distribution  sale  marketing and promotion of such devices 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizures of products  total or partial suspension of production  failure of the government to grant premarket clearance or approval for devices  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed by us 
in the united states  medical devices are classified into one of three classes class i  ii or iii  on the basis of the controls deemed necessary by the fda to reasonably assure the safety and effectiveness of such products 
under fda regulations  class i devices are subject to general controls for example  labeling  premarket notification and adherence to quality system regulations qsrs requirements 
class ii devices receive marketing clearance through either a k premarket notification or a pma 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device  or to a class iii medical device for which the fda has not called for a pma 
the fda may determine that a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  or that additional information or data are needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
a request for additional data may require that clinical studies of the device s safety and efficacy be performed 
commercial distribution of a device for which a k notification is required can begin only after the fda issues an order finding the device to be substantially equivalent to a previously cleared device 
the fda has recently been requiring a more rigorous demonstration of substantial equivalence than in the past 
even in cases where the fda grants a k clearance  it can take the fda from three to six months from the date of submission to grant a k clearance  but it may take longer 
a not substantially equivalent determination  or a request for additional information  could delay the market introduction of new products that fall into this category and could have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for any of our products that are cleared through the k process  such as our iq system  modifications or enhancements that could significantly affect the safety or efficacy of the device or that constitute a major change to the intended use of the device will require new k submissions 
a pma application must be submitted if a proposed device is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or class ii device  or if it is a class iii device for which the fda has called for pmas 
a pma application must be supported by valid scientific evidence which typically includes extensive data  including human clinical trial data  to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the device 
the pma application must also contain the results of all relevant bench tests  laboratory and animal studies  a complete description of the device and its components  and a detailed description of the methods  facilities and controls used to manufacture the device 
in addition  the submission must also contain the proposed labeling  advertising literature and training methods 
upon receipt of a pma application  the fda makes a threshold determination as to whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review 
if the fda determines that the pma application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review  the fda will accept the application for filing 
once the submission is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the pma 
an fda review of a pma application generally takes one to two years from the date the pma application is accepted for filing  but may take significantly longer 
the review time is often significantly extended as a result of the fda asking for more information or clarification of information already provided in the submission 
during the review period  an advisory committee  typically a panel of clinicians  will likely be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the fda as to whether the device should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory panel 
toward the end of the pma review process  the fda generally will conduct an inspection of the manufacturer s facilities to ensure that the facilities are in compliance with applicable qsr requirements 

table of contents if the fda s evaluations of both the pma application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable  the fda will either issue an approval letter or an approvable letter  which may contain a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the pma 
when  and if  those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the fda  the agency will issue a pma approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications 
the fda may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary or other deficiencies exist in the pma  in which case pma approval may be delayed 
the pma process can be expensive  uncertain and lengthy  and a number of devices for which the fda approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing 
if human clinical trials of a device are required in connection with either a k notification or a pma  and the device presents a significant risk  the sponsor of the trial usually the manufacturer or the distributor of the device is required to file an investigational device exemption ide application prior to commencing human clinical trials 
the ide application must be supported by data  typically including the results of animal and laboratory testing 
if the ide application is reviewed and approved by the fda and one or more appropriate institutional review boards irbs  human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients  as approved by the fda 
if the device presents a non significant risk to the patient  a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the study by one or more appropriate irbs 
we have obtained k clearance for all of our marketed products 
we have also modified aspects of our products since receiving regulatory clearance  but we believe that new k clearances are not required for these modifications 
after a device receives k clearance or a pma  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in its intended use  will require a new clearance or approval 
the fda requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially  but the fda can review any such decision and can disagree with a manufacturer s determination 
if the fda disagrees with our determination not to seek a new k clearance or pma  the fda may retroactively require us to seek k clearance or premarket approval 
the fda could also require us to cease marketing and distribution and or recall the modified device until k clearance or pma approval is obtained 
also  in these circumstances  we may be subject to significant regulating fines or penalties 
any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda clearances or approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic inspections by the fda and certain state agencies 
the fda act requires devices to be manufactured to comply with applicable qsr regulations which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us with respect to design  development  manufacturing and quality assurance activities 
we are subject to unannounced inspections by the fda and the food and drug branch of the california department of health services  or cdhs  to determine our compliance with the qsr and other regulations  and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors 
labeling and promotion activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the fda actively enforces regulations prohibiting marketing of products for unapproved uses 
we and our products are also subject to a variety of state laws and regulations in those states or localities where our products are or will be marketed 
any applicable state or local regulations may hinder our ability to market our products in those states or localities 
manufacturers are also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protection  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with such laws and regulations now or in the future 
such laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our ability to do business 

table of contents exports of our products are regulated by the fda and are covered by the export amendment of  which greatly expanded the export of approved and unapproved united states medical devices 
however  some foreign countries require manufacturers to provide an fda certificate for products for export cpe which requires the device manufacturer to certify to the fda that the product has been granted premarket clearance in the united states and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with qsr at the time of the last qsr inspection 
the fda will refuse to issue a cpe if significant outstanding qsr violations exist 
we are also regulated under the radiation control for health and safety act  which requires laser products to comply with performance standards  including design and operation requirements  and manufacturers to certify in product labeling and in reports to the fda that their products comply with all such standards 
the law also requires laser manufacturers to file new product and annual reports  maintain manufacturing  testing and sales records and report product defects 
various warning labels must be affixed and certain protective devices installed  depending on the class of the product 
the introduction of our products in foreign markets will also subject us to foreign regulatory clearances which may impose substantial additional costs and burdens 
international sales of medical devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country 
the regulatory review process varies from country to country 
many countries also impose product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices 
in addition  each country has its own tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
the approval by the fda and foreign government authorities is unpredictable and uncertain 
the necessary approvals or clearances may not be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in receipt of  or a failure to receive  such approvals or clearances  or the loss of any previously received approvals or clearances  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in existing requirements or adoption of new requirements or policies by the fda or other foreign and domestic regulatory authorities could adversely affect our ability to comply with regulatory requirements 
failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be required to incur significant costs to comply with laws and regulations in the future 
these laws or regulations may have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
reimbursement the cost of a significant portion of medical care in the united states is funded by government programs  health maintenance organizations and private insurance plans 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as government programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other health care providers have significantly impacted the spending budgets of doctors  clinics and hospitals to acquire new equipment  including our products 
under certain government insurance programs  a health care provider is reimbursed for a fixed sum for services rendered in treating a patient  regardless of the actual charge for such treatment 
the center for medicare and medicaid services cms reimburses hospitals on a prospectively determined fixed amount for the costs associated with an in patient hospitalization based on the patient s discharge diagnosis 
cms reimburses physicians a prospectively determined fixed amount based on the procedure performed  regardless of the actual costs incurred by the hospital or physician in furnishing the care and regardless of the specific devices used in that procedure 
reimbursement issues have affected sales of our ophthalmic products to a greater extent than sales of our dermatologic products because dermatology procedures  in general  are not covered under most insurance programs and the cost of these procedures are paid for by the patient 

table of contents private third party reimbursement plans are also developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling health care costs by imposing limitations on reimbursable procedures and the exploration of more cost effective methods of delivering health care 
in general  these government and private measures have caused health care providers  including our customers  to be more selective in the purchase of medical products 
in addition  changes in government regulation or in private third party payers policies may limit or eliminate reimbursement for procedures employing our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect future results we depend on third party coverage and reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 
product liability and insurance we may be subject to product liability claims in the future 
our products are highly complex and are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and skin conditions on and near a patient s face 
our products are often used in situations where there is a high risk of serious injury or adverse side effects 
we recommend that our disposable products only be used once and prominently label these disposables 
if a disposable product is not adequately sterilized by the customer between such uses  a patient could suffer serious consequences  possibly resulting in a suit against us for damages 
accordingly  the manufacture and sale of medical products entails significant risk of product liability claims 
although we currently maintain and intend to continue the company s product liability insurance  adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
such insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  we have not experienced any product liability claims which would result in payments in excess of our policy limits 
backlog we generally do not maintain a high level of backlog 
as a result  we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is indicative of future sales levels 
employees at december   we had a total of full time employees  including in operations  in sales and marketing  in research and product innovation and in finance and administration 
we also employ  from time to time  a number of temporary and part time employees as well as consultants on a contract basis 
at december   we employed such persons 
we intend to hire additional personnel during the next twelve months primarily in the product innovation  direct sales  production and finance areas 
we hired additional employees in january in connection with our acquisition of the assets of laserscope s aesthetics business 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract  train  retain and motivate highly qualified employees  who are in great demand 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our employees are not represented by a collective bargaining organization  and we have never experienced a work stoppage or strike 
we consider our employee relations to be good

table of contents item a 
risk factors factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information contained in this annual report form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operation 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we do not believe that our current liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to meet our currently planned operating requirements for the next months 
we do not believe that our current liquidity and capital resources  cash expected to be generated from operations and our ability to draw down on our credit facilities  if at all  will be sufficient to meet our currently planned operating requirements for the next months 
our concerns about our ability to satisfy our liquidity requirements over the next months are primarily a result of our current operating performance relative to plan  as well as our continuing losses  negative cash flows and current liquidity in relation to future obligations  including our obligation to make a payment in october to laserscope for the purchase of certain inventory under our supply agreement we entered into with american medical systems holdings in connection with the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope and our expected inability to satisfy certain covenants under our loan agreement with mid peninsula bank  part of greater bay bank na  and the export import bank as of march  our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  issued an opinion in connection with their audit of our financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  which stated  that there was substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
our recent and current operating performance has not met our expectations  primarily as a result of our inability to realize the full benefits of the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope in our previously anticipated time frame  as well as recent negative cash flows from operations 
in particular  revenues from the aesthetics business have been below our expectations 
our ability to realize the potential benefits of the acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the aesthetics business 
as expected  our efforts towards integrating the aesthetics business of laserscope has and will continue to take a significant amount of time and place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources  and may continue to be more difficult and expensive than originally anticipated 
this continued diversion of our management s attention and any additional delays or difficulties encountered in connection with the integration of the aesthetics business will harm our operating results and increase the difficulty of our being able to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
in addition  we currently expect that our operating performance for our first fiscal quarter ending march  will result in our not being able to satisfy certain current restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities with mid peninsula bank and the export import bank  and if we default on these credit facilities and the lenders exercise their remedies  this will further contribute to the difficulties we expect to face in meeting our liquidity requirements over the next months 
our obligations under these credit facilities are secured by a lien on substantially all of the company s assets 
each of these credit facilities contain certain customary covenants which require the company to maintain profitability beginning in our second fiscal quarter of and to meet certain tangible net worth and debt service requirements 
in addition  we must maintain million in restricted cash at all times when borrowings are outstanding 
we currently have drawn down million under this credit facility which is the full amount currently available  and  given our current financial status  we currently do not expect to be able to satisfy the restrictive covenants relating to these facilities as of march  in the event of default by the company with the covenants under these facilities  mid peninsula bank and the export import bank  would be entitled to exercise their remedies  under these facilities  which include declaring all obligations immediately due and payable and disposing of the collateral if obligations were not paid 
we have initiated discussions with a view toward restructuring these credit facilities to enable us to come into compliance with applicable covenants  however  we cannot assure you that these discussions will be successful 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii of this report for more information regarding these credit facilities 
in order to address our liquidity issues  we plan to  among other things i work towards integrating the aesthetics business as quickly and efficiently as possible and maximizing the potential benefits that may be realized from the acquisition  ii modify our planned operations in order to increase our cash flows from operations  iii seek to restructure our credit facilities  and iv raise additional capital through equity or debt financing in order to enhance our liquidity 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or that any additional capital raised through debt or equity financings will be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unsuccessful in these efforts  we may have to suspend or cease operations or significantly dilute our stockholders equity holdings 
we have more indebtedness and fewer liquid resources after the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope  which could adversely affect our cash flows and business 
in order to complete the acquisition  we entered into financing arrangements that provide for a million term loan and a revolving credit line of up to million 
we had no debt outstanding at december  we had million outstanding on january  when the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope was consummated 
we also used the majority of our liquid resources to finance the acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope 
upon the transfer of the manufacturing of the laserscope products from laserscope to us  we are required to purchase up to million of raw materials inventory from laserscope 
as a result of the increase in debt  demands on our cash resources may increase after the completion of the acquisition 
the increased levels of debt could  among other things require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt  increase our vulnerability to  and limit our flexibility in planning for  adverse economic and industry conditions  increase our sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  result in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements  which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable  affect our credit rating  limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  additional acquisitions and other general corporate requirements  create competitive disadvantages compared to other companies with less indebtedness  and limit our ability to apply proceeds from an offering or asset sale to purposes other than the repayment of debt 
our loan agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business and to service our indebtedness  we will require a significant amount of cash 
our ability to generate cash flow depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure holders that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior credit facility or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under our debt and to fund other liquidity needs 
our loan agreements contain covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 

table of contents although we expect that our acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope will result in benefits to the company  the company may not realize those benefits because of integration and other challenges 
on january   we completed our acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope the aesthetics business  a wholly owned subsidiary of american medical systems holdings  inc our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to integrate the aesthetics business with our business 
integrating the aesthetics business may be expensive and time consuming and we may not be able to successfully do so 
integration efforts often take a significant amount of time  place a significant strain on managerial  operational and financial resources and can prove to be more difficult or expensive than predicted 
the diversion of our management s attention and any delay or difficulties encountered in connection with the pending acquisition of the aesthetics business could result in the disruption of our on going business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures and policies that could negatively affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers  suppliers  collaborators  employees and others with whom we have business dealings 
these disruptions could harm our operating results 
further  the following specific factors may adversely affect our ability to integrate the aesthetics business coordinating marketing functions  transferring of the manufacturing of the laserscope products to the company  unanticipated issues in integrating information  communications and other systems  unanticipated incompatibility of purchasing  logistics  marketing and administration methods  greater than anticipated liabilities  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  coordinating our current product and process development efforts with those of the aesthetics business in a way which permits us to bring future new products to the market in a timely and cost effective manner  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
we cannot assure you that the combination of the aesthetics business with us will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated from the acquisition 
in addition  as part of our acquisition  we entered into agreements with laserscope to obtain certain manufacturing support  administrative services and future intellectual property rights 
in the event that laserscope fails to provide this support and service  or provides such support and service at a level of quality and timeliness inconsistent with the historical delivery of such support and service  or fails to grant us the intellectual property rights we expected  our ability to integrate the aesthetics business will be hampered and our operating results may be harmed 
failure to remediate the material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures in a timely manner  or at all  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our regulatory or reporting obligations 
we evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report and  based on this evaluation  management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the material weaknesses detailed in item a of part ii of this annual report on form k 
in particular  the material weaknesses identified related to the company s period end review procedures 
we are taking a number of remedial actions designed to remedy the material weaknesses summarized above 
however  if despite our remediation efforts  we fail to remediate our material weaknesses  we could be subject to regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public confidence in our disclosure controls and procedures 
these remediation efforts will likely increase our general and administrative expenses and could  therefore  have an adverse effect on our reported net income 
even if we are to successfully remediate such material weaknesses  because of inherent limitations  our disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect misstatements or material omissions 
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 

table of contents we rely on continued market acceptance of our existing products and any decline in sales of our existing products would adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we currently market visible and infrared light therapeutic based photocoagulator medical laser systems and delivery devices to the ophthalmology and aesthetics markets 
we believe that continued and increased sales  if any  of these medical laser systems is dependent upon a number of factors including the following acceptance of product performance  features  ease of use  scalability and durability  acceptance of the company s new marketing programs  recommendations and opinions by ophthalmologists  dermatologists  other clinicians  plastic surgeons and their associated opinion leaders  including study outcomes  price of our products and prices of competing products and technologies  availability of competing products  technologies and alternative treatments  and level of reimbursement for treatments administered with our products 
in addition  we derive a meaningful portion of our sales from recurring revenues including disposable laser probes  endoprobes and service 
our ability to increase recurring revenues from the sale of endoprobes will depend primarily upon the features of our current products and product innovation  ease of use and prices of our products  including the relationship to prices of competing delivery devices 
the level of service revenues will depend on our quality of care  responsiveness and the willingness of our customers to request our services rather than purchase competing products or services 
any significant decline in market acceptance of our products or our revenues derived from the sales of laser consoles  delivery devices or services may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if there is not sufficient demand for the procedures performed with our products  practitioner demand for our products could be inhibited  resulting in unfavorable operating results and reduced growth potential 
continued expansion of the global market for laser and other light based aesthetic procedures is a material assumption of our growth strategy 
most procedures performed using our products are elective procedures not reimbursable through government or private health insurance  with the costs borne by the patient 
the decision to utilize our products may therefore be influenced by a number of factors  including evolving customer needs  the introduction of new products and technologies  evolving surgical practices  evolving industry standards  the cost of procedures performed using our products  the cost  safety and effectiveness of alternative treatments  including treatments which are not based upon laser or other light based technologies and treatments which use pharmaceutical products  the success of our sales and marketing efforts  and consumer confidence  which may be impacted by economic and political conditions 
if  as a result of these factors  there is not sufficient demand for the procedures performed with our products  practitioner demand for our products could be reduced  resulting in unfavorable operating results and lower growth potential 

table of contents our future success depends on our ability to develop and successfully introduce new products and new applications 
our future success is dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory approval or clearance of  manufacture and market new products 
successful commercialization of new products and new applications will require that we effectively transfer production processes from research and development to manufacturing and effectively coordinate with our suppliers 
in addition  we must successfully sell and achieve market acceptance of new products and applications and enhanced versions of existing products 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  price  safety  efficacy  reliability  marketing and sales efforts  the development of new applications for these products  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration  or fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce new products or enhanced versions of existing products and achieve market acceptance of new products and new applications could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and would cause our net revenues to decline 
while we devote significant resources to research and development  our research and development may not lead to new products that achieve commercial success 
our research and development process is expensive  prolonged  and entails considerable uncertainty 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic and aesthetic research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully 
the products currently in our development pipeline may not be approved by regulatory entities and may not be commercially successful  and our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products of current or future competitors 
therefore  even if we are able to successfully develop enhancements or new generations of our products  these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce revenue in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features 
the clinical trial process required to obtain regulatory approvals is costly and uncertain  and could result in delays in new product introductions or even an inability to release a product 
the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our products are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  clinical trials but cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials showed promising results 
any of our products may produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda  or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
we face strong competition in our markets and expect the level of competition to grow in the foreseeable future 
competition in the market for devices used for ophthalmic and dermatology treatment procedures is intense and is expected to increase 
our competitive position depends on a number of factors including product performance  characteristics and functionality  ease of use  scalability  durability and cost 
our principal competitors in ophthalmology are lumenis ltd  nidek  carl zeiss  inc  alcon  and synergetics  inc most of these companies currently offer a competitive semiconductor based laser system in ophthalmology 
also within ophthalmology pharmaceutical alternative treatments for amd such as visudyne novartis  macugen osi pharmaceuticals and lucentis genentech compete rigorously with traditional laser procedures 
our principal competitors in dermatology are palomar technologies  candela corporation  syneron  and lumenis ltd 
some competitors have substantially greater financial  engineering  product development  manufacturing  marketing and technical resources than we do 
some companies also have greater name recognition than we do and long standing customer relationships 
in addition to other companies that manufacture photocoagulators  we compete with pharmaceuticals  other technologies and other surgical techniques 
some medical companies  academic and research institutions  or others  may develop new technologies or therapies that are more effective in treating conditions targeted by us or are less expensive than our current or future products 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if we cannot increase our sales volumes  reduce our costs or introduce higher margin products to offset anticipated reductions in the average unit price of our products  our operating results may suffer 
we have experienced some declines in the average unit price of our products and expect to continue to suffer from declines in the future 
the average unit price of our products may decrease in the future in response to changes in product mix  competitive pricing pressures  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
if we are unable to offset the anticipated decrease in our average selling prices by increasing our sales volumes or through new product introductions  our net revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins we must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our products 
if we cannot maintain our gross margins our business could be seriously harmed  particularly if the average selling price of our products decreases significantly without a corresponding increase in sales 
we depend on sales of our ophthalmology products for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenue and profits from sales of our ophthalmology products 
for the fiscal year ended december   our ophthalmology sales were million or of total sales 
we anticipate that sales of our ophthalmology products will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future 
we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our operating results 
we derive  and expect to continue to derive  a large portion of our revenue from international sales 
for the year ended december   our international sales were million 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues  particularly ophthalmology  in the foreseeable future 
none of our international revenues and costs has been denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products more expensive and thus less competitive in foreign markets 
the factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our international operations and sales are subject to a number of other risks and potential costs  including differing local product preferences and product requirements  cultural differences  changes in foreign medical reimbursement and coverage policies and programs  political and economic instability  impact of recessions in economies outside of the united states  difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations  performance of our international channel of distributors  foreign certification requirements  including continued ability to use the ce mark in europe  
table of contents reduced or limited protections of intellectual property rights in jurisdictions outside the united states  longer accounts receivable collection periods  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  potentially adverse tax consequences  and multiple protectionist  adverse and changing foreign governmental laws and regulations 
any one or more of these factors stated above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
as we expand our existing international operations  especially following our acquisition of the aesthetics business of laserscope  we may encounter new risks 
for example  as we focus on building our international sales and distribution networks in new geographic regions  we must continue to develop relationships with qualified local distributors and trading companies 
if we are not successful in developing these relationships  we may not be able to grow sales in these geographic regions 
these or other similar risks could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
we are exposed to risks associated with worldwide economic slowdowns and related uncertainties 
concerns about consumer and investor confidence  volatile corporate profits and reduced capital spending  international conflicts  terrorist and military activity  civil unrest and pandemic illness could cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations 
in addition  political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
unstable political  social and economic conditions make it difficult for our customers  our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
in particular  it is difficult to develop and implement strategy  sustainable business models and efficient operations  as well as effectively manage supply chain relationships 
if such conditions persist  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we rely on our direct sales force and network of international distributors to sell our products and any failure to maintain our direct sales force and distributor relationships could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenue depends upon our direct sales force within the united states and relationships with independent distributors outside the united states 
currently our direct sales force consists of employees and we maintain relationships with independent distributors internationally selling our products into countries through four direct area sales managers 
we generally grant our distributors exclusive territories for the sale of our products in specified countries 
the amount and timing of resources dedicated by our distributors to the sales of our products is not within our control 
our international sales are entirely dependent on the efforts of these third parties 
if any distributor breaches terms of its distribution agreement or fails to generate sales of our products  we may be forced to replace the distributor and our ability to sell our products into that exclusive sales territory would be adversely affected 
we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
we may be unable to replace our direct sales force personnel with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  which may limit our revenues and our ability to maintain market share 
the loss of the services of these key personnel would harm our business 
similarly  our distributor agreements are generally terminable at will by either party and distributors may terminate their relationships with us  which would affect our international sales and results of operations 

table of contents if we lose key personnel or fail to integrate replacement personnel successfully  our ability to manage our business could be impaired 
our future success depends upon the continued service of our key management  technical  sales  and other critical personnel 
our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
key personnel have left our company in the past and there likely will be additional departures of key personnel from time to time in the future 
the loss of any key employee could result in significant disruptions to our operations  including adversely affecting the timeliness of product releases  the successful implementation and completion of company initiatives  and the results of our operations 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in our industry and the san francisco bay area  as well as other geographic markets in which we recruit  is intense and characterized by increasing salaries  which may increase our operating expenses or hinder our ability to recruit qualified candidates 
in addition  the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful 
if we fail to accurately forecast demand for our product and component requirements for the manufacture of our product  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays and may experience lost sales or significant inventory carrying costs 
we use quarterly and annual forecasts based primarily on our anticipated product orders to plan our manufacturing efforts and determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our product and the lead times required to obtain the necessary components and materials 
lead times for components vary significantly and depend on numerous factors  including the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms and current market demand for such components 
if we overestimate the demand for our product  we may have excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
over the past several quarters  we have placed a high priority on our asset management efforts to  among other things  reduce overall inventory levels and increase our cash position 
if we underestimate demand for our product and  consequently  our component and materials requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing  delay delivery of our product to our customers and result in the loss of customer sales 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
we depend on sole source or limited source suppliers 
we rely on third parties to manufacture substantially all of the components used in our products  including optics  laser diodes and crystals 
we have some long term or volume purchase agreements with our suppliers and currently purchase components on a purchase order basis 
some of our suppliers and manufacturers are sole or limited sources 
in addition  some of these suppliers are relatively small private companies that may discontinue their operations at any time 
there are risks associated with the use of independent manufacturers  including the following unavailability of  shortages or limitations on the ability to obtain supplies of components in the quantities that we require  delays in delivery or failure of suppliers to deliver critical components on the dates we require  failure of suppliers to manufacture components to our specifications  and potentially reduced quality  and inability to obtain components at acceptable prices 

table of contents our business and operating results may suffer from the lack of alternative sources of supply for critical sole and limited source components 
the process of qualifying suppliers is complex  requires extensive testing with our products  and may be lengthy  particularly as new products are introduced 
new suppliers would have to be educated in our production processes 
in addition  the use of alternate components may require design alterations to our products and additional product testing under fda and relevant foreign regulatory agency guidelines  which may delay sales and increase product costs 
any failures by our vendors to adequately supply limited and sole source components may impair our ability to offer our existing products  delay the submission of new products for regulatory approval and market introduction  materially harm our business and financial condition and cause our stock price to decline 
establishing our own capabilities to manufacture these components would be expensive and could significantly decrease our profit margins 
our business  results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected if we are unable to continue to obtain components in the quantity and quality desired and at the prices we have budgeted 
we face risks associated with our collaborative and oem relationships 
our collaborators may not pursue further development and commercialization of products resulting from collaborations with us or may not devote sufficient resources to the marketing and sale of such products 
for example  in we developed and sold a laser system on an oem basis for a third party which positively impacted the revenues and gross margins during the second half of we cannot provide assurance that these types of relationships will continue over a longer period 
our reliance on others for clinical development  manufacturing and distribution of our products may result in unforeseen problems 
further  our collaborative partners may develop or pursue alternative technologies either on their own or in collaboration with others 
if a collaborator elects to terminate its agreement with us  our ability to develop  introduce  market and sell the product may be significantly impaired and we may be forced to discontinue altogether the product resulting from the collaboration 
we may not be able to negotiate alternative collaboration agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
the failure of any current or future collaboration efforts could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face manufacturing risks 
the manufacture of our infrared and visible light photocoagulators and the related delivery devices is a highly complex and precise process 
we assemble critical subassemblies and all of our final products at our facility in mountain view  california 
we may experience manufacturing difficulties  quality control issues or assembly constraints  particularly with regard to new products that we may introduce 
we may not be able to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products  which may require that we qualify other manufacturers for our products 
furthermore  we may experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in our manufacturing operations and  as a result  product shipments to our customers could be delayed  which would negatively impact our net revenues 
we depend on collaborative relationships to develop  introduce and market new products  product enhancements and new applications 
we depend on both clinical and commercial collaborative relationships 
we have entered into collaborative relationships with academic medical centers and physicians in connection with the research and innovation and clinical testing of our products 
commercially  we currently collaborate with bausch lomb to design and manufacture a solid state green wavelength nm laser photocoagulator module  called the millennium endolase module 
the millennium endolase module is designed to be a component of bausch lomb s ophthalmic surgical suite product offering and is not expected to be sold as a stand alone product 
sales of the millennium endolase module are dependent upon the actual order rate from and shipment rate to bausch lomb  which depends on the efforts of our partner and is beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our relationship with bausch lomb will result in further sales of our millennium endolase module 
the failure to obtain any additional future clinical or commercial collaborations and the resulting failure or success of such arrangements of any current or future clinical or commercial collaboration relationships could have a material adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products or applications and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if we fail to maintain our relationships with health care providers  customers may not buy our products and our revenue and profitability may decline 
we market our products to numerous health care providers  including eye care professionals  hospitals  ambulatory surgical centers  corporate optometry chains and group purchasing organizations 
we have developed and strive to maintain close relationships with members of each of these groups who assist in product research and development and advise us on how to satisfy the full range of surgeon and patient needs 
we rely on these groups to recommend our products to their patients and to other members of their organizations 
the failure of our existing products and any new products we may introduce to retain the support of these various groups could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year 
our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year in the future 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
factors contributing to these fluctuations include the following general economic uncertainties and political concerns  the timing of the introduction and market acceptance of new products  product enhancements and new applications  changes in demand for our existing line of dermatology and ophthalmic products  the cost and availability of components and subassemblies  including the ability of our sole or limited source suppliers to deliver components at the times and prices that we have planned  our ability to maintain sales volumes at a level sufficient to cover fixed manufacturing and operating costs  fluctuations in our product mix between dermatology and ophthalmic products and foreign and domestic sales  the effect of regulatory approvals and changes in domestic and foreign regulatory requirements  introduction of new products  product enhancements and new applications by our competitors  entry of new competitors into our markets  pricing pressures and other competitive factors  our long and highly variable sales cycle  changes in the prices at which we can sell our products  changes in customers or potential customers budgets as a result of  among other things  reimbursement policies of government programs and private insurers for treatments that use our products  and increased product innovation costs 
in addition to these factors  our quarterly results have been  and are expected to continue to be  affected by seasonal factors 

table of contents our expense levels are based  in part  on expected future sales 
if sales levels in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  we may be unable to adjust operating expenses quickly enough to compensate for the shortfall of sales  and our results of operations may be adversely affected 
in addition  we have historically made a significant portion of each quarter s product shipments near the end of the quarter 
if that pattern continues  any delays in shipment of products could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for such quarter 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter and year to year comparisons of our past operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any quarter or year as an indication of our future performance 
our operating results in future quarters and years may be below expectations  which would likely cause the price of our common stock to fall 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile and an investment in our common stock could suffer a decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in our operating results  announcements by us or our competitors of new products or of significant clinical achievements  changes in market valuations of other similar companies in our industry and general market conditions 
from time to time  we meet with investors and potential investors 
in addition  we receive attention by securities analysts and present at analyst meetings when invited 
our common stock may experience an imbalance between supply and demand resulting from low trading volumes 
these broad market fluctuations could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock regardless of our performance 
material increases in interest rates may harm our sales 
we currently sell our products primarily to health care providers in general practice 
these health care providers often purchase our products with funds they secure through various financing arrangements with third party financial institutions  including credit facilities and short term loans 
if interest rates continue to increase  these financing arrangements will be more expensive to our customers  which would effectively increase the overall cost of owning our products for our customers and  thereby  may decrease demand for our products 
any reduction in the sales of our products would cause our business to suffer 
we are subject to government regulation which may cause us to delay or withdraw the introduction of new products or new applications for our products 
the medical devices that we market and manufacture are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and by foreign and state governments 
under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the related regulations  the fda regulates the design  development  clinical testing  manufacture  labeling  sale  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the product must undergo rigorous testing and an extensive regulatory review process implemented by the fda under federal law 
unless otherwise exempt  a device manufacturer must obtain market clearance through either the k premarket notification process or the lengthier premarket approval application pma process 
depending upon the type  complexity and novelty of the device and the nature of the disease or disorder to be treated  the fda process can take several years  require extensive clinical testing and result in significant expenditures 
even if regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown safety issues may result in restrictions on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
other countries also have extensive regulations regarding clinical trials and testing prior to new product introductions 
our failure to obtain government approvals or any delays in receipt of such approvals would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the fda imposes additional regulations on manufacturers of approved medical devices 
we are required to comply with the applicable quality system regulations and our manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspections by the fda and corresponding state agencies  including unannounced inspections  and must be licensed as part of the product approval process before being utilized for commercial manufacturing 
noncompliance with the applicable requirements can result in  among other things  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  withdrawal of marketing approvals  and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has the authority to request repair  replacement or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
any of these actions by the fda would materially and adversely affect our ability to continue operating our business and the results of our operations 

table of contents in addition  we are also subject to varying product standards  packaging requirements  labeling requirements  tariff regulations  duties and tax requirements 
as a result of our sales in europe  we are required to have all products ce marked  an international symbol affixed to all products demonstrating compliance with the european medical device directive and all applicable standards 
while currently all of our released products are ce marked  continued certification is based on the successful review of our quality system by our european registrar during their annual audit 
any loss of certification would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to comply with the fda s quality system regulation and laser performance standards  our manufacturing operations could be halted  and our business would suffer 
we are currently required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr 
the qsr is a complex regulatory scheme that covers the methods and documentation of the design  testing  control  manufacturing  labeling  quality assurance  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
because our products involve the use of lasers  our products also are covered by a performance standard for lasers set forth in fda regulations 
the laser performance standard imposes specific record keeping  reporting  product testing and product labeling requirements 
these requirements include affixing warning labels to laser products  as well as incorporating certain safety features in the design of laser products 
the fda enforces the qsr and laser performance standards through periodic unannounced inspections 
we have been  and anticipate in the future being  subject to such inspections 
our failure to take satisfactory corrective action in response to an adverse qsr inspection or our failure to comply with applicable laser performance standards could result in enforcement actions  including a public warning letter  a shutdown of our manufacturing operations  a recall of our products  civil or criminal penalties  or other sanctions  such as those described in the preceding paragraph  which would cause our sales and business to suffer 
if we modify one of our fda approved devices  we may need to seek reapproval  which  if not granted  would prevent us from selling our modified products or cause us to redesign our products 
any modifications to an fda cleared device that would significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new k clearance or possibly a pre market approval 
we may not be able to obtain additional k clearance or pre market approvals for new products or for modifications to  or additional indications for  our existing products in a timely fashion  or at all 
delays in obtaining future clearance would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner  which in turn would harm our revenue and future profitability 
we have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearance or approvals 
if the fda disagrees  and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications  we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices  which could harm our operating results and require us to redesign our products 
we rely on patents and proprietary rights to protect our intellectual property and business 
our success and ability to compete is dependent in part upon our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trade secrets  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure and other contractual agreements and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
we file patent applications to protect technology  inventions and improvements that are significant to the development of our business 
we have been issued fifteen united states patents and five foreign patents on the technologies related to our products and processes 
we have approximately five pending patent applications in the united states and six foreign pending patent applications that have been filed 
our patent applications may not be approved 
any patents granted now or in the future may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and development by our competitors of competing products 
moreover  our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may seek to apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use or sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 

table of contents in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how which we seek to protect  in part  through proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our proprietary information agreements with our employees and consultants contain industry standard provisions requiring such individuals to assign to us without additional consideration any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
proprietary information agreements with employees  consultants and others may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
also  our trade secrets may become known to or independently developed by competitors 
the laser and medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and our competitors 
until recently patent applications were maintained in secrecy in the united states until the patents issued 
patent applications filed in the united states after november generally will be published eighteen months after the filing date 
however  since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time  both within the united states and with regards to international patent applications  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents or patent applications held by third parties 
we have  from time to time  been notified of  or have otherwise been made aware of  claims that we may be infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders commonly offer such licenses  licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable 
any claims  with or without merit  and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits  would be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require us to develop noninfringing technology or to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding and failure to obtain necessary licenses or develop alternate technologies could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
management believes that liabilities resulting from the synergetics litigation matters described in part i  item  or other claims which are pending or known to be threatened  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
however  it is possible that cash flows or results or operations could be materially affected in any particular period by the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these contingencies or because of the diversion of management s attention and the incurrence of significant expenses 
the requirements of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of might strain our resources  which may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we are subject to a number of requirements  including the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the sarbanes oxley act of beginning in we will be required to comply with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act which will require management to perform an assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
these requirements might place a strain on our systems and resources 
the sarbanes oxley act requires  among other things  that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting  significant resources and management oversight will be required 
as a result  our management s attention might be diverted from other business concerns  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and operating results 
in addition  we might need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge  and we might not be able to do so in a timely fashion 

table of contents because we do not require training for users of our products  and sell our products to non physicians  there exists an increased potential for misuse of our products  which could harm our reputation and our business 
federal regulations allow us to sell our products to or on the order of licensed practitioners 
the definition of licensed practitioners varies from state to state 
as a result  our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training  and in many states by non physicians  including nurse practitioners  chiropractors and technicians 
outside the united states  many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products 
we do not supervise the procedures performed with our products  nor do we require that direct medical supervision occur 
we  and our distributors  generally offer but do not require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions 
in addition  we sometimes sell our systems to companies that rent our systems to third parties and that provide a technician to perform the procedure 
the lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes  which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation 
some of our laser systems are complex in design and may contain defects that are not detected until deployed by our customers  which could increase our costs and reduce our revenues 
laser systems are inherently complex in design and require ongoing regular maintenance 
the manufacture of our lasers  laser products and systems involves a highly complex and precise process 
as a result of the technical complexity of our products  changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
to the extent that we do not achieve such yields or product reliability  our business  operating results  financial condition and customer relationships would be adversely affected 
we provide warranties on certain of our product sales  and allowances for estimated warranty costs are recorded during the period of sale 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of failure rates and expected costs to repair or replace the products under warranty 
we currently establish warranty reserves based on historical warranty costs for each product line 
if actual return rates and or repair and replacement costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to recognize additional cost of sales may be required in future periods 
our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  some of our products are combined with products from other vendors  which may contain defects 
as a result  should problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
if we are unable to identify and fix defects or other problems  we could experience  among other things loss of customers  increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving fda approval or clearance 
a recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
a recall could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant expenses  harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales 
if we fail to manage growth effectively  our business could be disrupted which could harm our operating results 
we have experienced and may continue to experience growth in our business 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments to enable our future growth through  among other things  new product innovation and clinical trials for new applications and products 
we must also be prepared to expand our work force and to train  motivate and manage additional employees as the need for additional personnel arises 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to effectively manage future growth could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our manufacturing capacity may not be adequate to meet the demands of our business 
if our sales increase substantially  we may need to increase our production capacity 
any prolonged disruption in the operation of our manufacturing facilities could materially harm our business 
we cannot assure you that if we choose to scale up our manufacturing operations  we will have the resources necessary to do so  or that we will be able to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely fashion  which could affect our ability to meet product demand or result in additional costs 
if product liability claims are successfully asserted against us  we may incur substantial liabilities that may adversely affect our business or results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims from time to time 
our products are highly complex and some are used to treat extremely delicate eye tissue and skin conditions on and near a patient s face 
although we maintain product liability insurance with coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual aggregate maximum of million  our coverage from our insurance policies may not be adequate 
product liability insurance is expensive 
we might not be able to obtain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or in sufficient amounts to protect us  if at all 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results may be adversely affected by changes in third party coverage and reimbursement policies and any uncertainty regarding healthcare reform measures 
our ophthalmology products are typically purchased by doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users  which bill various third party payers  such as governmental programs and private insurance plans  for the health care services provided to their patients 
third party payers are increasingly scrutinizing and challenging the coverage of new products and the level of reimbursement for covered products 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may not obtain adequate reimbursement for use of our products from third party payers 
while we believe that the laser procedures using our products have generally been reimbursed  payers may deny coverage and reimbursement for our products if they determine that the device was not reasonable and necessary for the purpose used  was investigational or was not cost effective 
in addition  third party payers may not initiate coverage of new procedures using our products for a significant period 
in september  the center for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  advised that claims for reimbursement for certain age related macular degeneration  or amd  procedures which use our oculight slx laser system  could be submitted for reimbursement  with coverage and payment to be determined by the local medical carriers at their discretion 
to date five carriers representing states have written reimbursement coverage policies on transpupillary thermotherapy  or ttt 
the states reimbursing for ttt are alaska  arizona  california  colorado  
table of contents hawaii  iowa  idaho  mississippi  north carolina  north dakota  nevada  oregon  pennsylvania  south dakota  tennessee  washington and wyoming 
domestic sales of the oculight slx laser system may continue to be limited until more local medical carriers reimburse for performing such amd procedures or until cms advises that claims for these procedures may be submitted directly to cms at the national level 
the clinical results of the tttcnv trial and other clinical trials may influence the individual state or cms decision to reimburse for certain laser procedures 
in november  we filed a cpt current procedural terminology change request form seeking the extension of category iii emerging technology codes t and t for wet and dry forms of amd 
we learned in early may that the panel had voted to retain the category iii codes t and t on reporting transpupillary thermotherapy ablation of macular drusen for an extension of five years or until codes have been accepted for placement in the category i section of cpt 
changes in government legislation or regulation or in private third party payers policies toward reimbursement for procedures employing our products may prohibit adequate reimbursement 
there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system  reduce the costs of healthcare and change medical reimbursement policies 
doctors  clinics  hospitals and other users of our products may decline to purchase our products to the extent there is uncertainty regarding reimbursement of medical procedures using our products and any healthcare reform measures 
further proposed legislation  regulation and policy changes affecting third party reimbursement are likely 
we are unable to predict what legislation or regulation  if any  relating to the health care industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future  or what effect such legislation or regulation may have on us 
however  denial of coverage and reimbursement of our products would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the successful outcome of clinical trials and the development of new applications using certain of our products will accelerate future revenue growth rates 
the company s ability to generate incremental revenue growth will depend  in part  on the successful outcome of clinical trials that lead to the development of new applications using our products 
clinical trials are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
if the future results of any of our clinical trials fail to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and or the development of new product applications  our ability to generate incremental revenue growth would be adversely affected 
we have supported several clinical trials  including  for example  the tttcnv and the ptamd clinical trials 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire  flood or earthquake 
all of our research and product innovation activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in mountain view  california 
any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities 

table of contents our business is subject to environmental regulations 
our facilities and operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental and occupational health and safety requirements of the united states and foreign countries  including those relating to discharges of substances to the air  water and land  the handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes and the cleanup of properties affected by pollutants 
failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
in the future  federal  state or local governments in the united states or foreign countries could enact new or more stringent laws or issue new or more stringent regulations concerning environmental and worker health and safety matters that could affect our operations 
also  in the future  contamination may be found to exist at our current or former facilities or off site locations where we have sent wastes 
we could be held liable for such newly discovered contamination which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
in addition  changes in environmental and worker health and safety requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
our export controls may not be adequate to ensure compliance with united states export laws  especially when we sell our products to distributors over which we have limited control 
the united states government has declared an embargo that restricts the export of products and services to a number of countries  including iran  syria  sudan and cuba  for a variety of reasons  including the support by these countries of terrorism 
we sell our products through distributors in europe  asia and the middle east  and in such circumstances  the distributor is responsible for interacting with the end user of our products  including assisting in the set up of any products purchased by such end user 
in order to comply with united states export laws  we have instituted export controls including training for our personnel in export restrictions and requirements  appointing an export control officer to oversee our export procedures  executing agreements with our distributors that include defining their territory for sale and requirements pertaining to united states export laws  obtaining end user information from our distributors and screening it to restricted party lists maintained by the united states government 
while we believe that these procedures are adequate to prevent the export or re export of our products into countries under embargo by the united states government  we cannot assure you that our products will not be exported or re exported by our distributors into such restricted countries 
in particular  our control over what our distributors do with our products is necessarily limited  and we cannot assure you that they will not sell our products to an end user in a country in violation of united states export laws 
any violation of united states export regulations could result in substantial legal  consulting and accounting costs  and significant fines and or criminal penalties 
in the event that our products are exported to countries under a united states trade embargo in violation of applicable united states export laws and regulations  such violations  costs and penalties or other actions that could be taken against us could adversely affect our reputation and or have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  prospects or results of operations 
we have sold and may continue to sell  with a license  our products into countries that are under embargo by the united states and as a result have incurred and may continue to incur significant legal  consulting and accounting fees and may place our company s reputation at risk 
united states export laws permit the sale of medical products to certain countries under embargo by the united states government if the seller of such products obtains a license to do so  which requirements are in place because the united states has designated such countries as state sponsors of terrorism 
certain of our products have been sold in syria under license through a distribution agreement with an independent distributor 
in addition  certain of our products were distributed in iran without united states governmental authorization 
the aggregate revenue generated by sales of our products into sudan and syria have been immaterial to our business and results of operations 
we may continue to supply medical devices to sudan and syria and other countries that are under embargo by the united states government upon obtaining all necessary licenses 
we do not believe  however  that our sales into such countries will be material to our business or results of operations 
there are risks we face in selling to countries under united states embargo  including  but not limited to  possible 
table of contents damage to our reputation for sales to countries that are deemed to support terrorism  and failure of our export controls to limit sales strictly to the terms of the relevant license  which failure may result in civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  we may incur significant legal  consulting and accounting costs in ensuring compliance with our export licenses to countries under embargo 
any damage to our reputation from such sales  failure to comply with the terms of our export licenses or the additional costs we incur in making such sales could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition  prospects or results of operations 
item properties we lease  square feet of space in mountain view  california 
this facility is being substantially utilized for all of our manufacturing and research and development efforts and also serves as our corporate headquarters 
this facility is utilized for both our ophthalmology medical device segment and our dermatology medical device segment 
in september  we entered into a lease amendment for our facility in mountain view 
the original lease term of this facility  which ended in february  was amended and extended until february the lease was also amended to grant us an option to renew this lease for an additional five year period beginning and continuing until at a base monthly rental amount to be negotiated at the time of the renewal 
management believes that our facility has capacity adequate for our current needs including the requirements for the acquisition of laserscope products and that suitable additional space or an alternative space would be available as needed in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
item legal proceedings on october   the company filed a suit in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri against synergetics  usa  inc for infringement of a patent 
the company later amended its complaint to assert infringement claims against synergetics  inc  synergetics usa  inc 
was dismissed from the suit 
the company alleges that synergetics infringes the company s patent by making and selling infringing products  including its quick disconnect laser probes and its quick disconnect laser probe adapter  and seeks injunctive relief  monetary damages  treble damages  costs and attorneys fees 
on july   the court issued a claim construction ruling  interpreting disputed phrases within the company s patent 
the court adopted the company s position with respect to of the patent terms  and adopted a position between the company s and synergetics positions with respect to the th term 
discovery closed on february  near the close of discovery  the company filed five summary judgment motions and synergetics filed four 
after the court s rulings on these motions  only four issues remain for trial 
those issues are the jury will decide the amount of damages caused by synergetics infringement with their quick disconnect products  the jury will decide whether synergetics infringement was willful  the jury will decide the validity of the iridex patent on the issue of obviousness  and the court will decide if iridex s right to recover damages for synergetics infringement is limited by the equitable doctrines of laches and estoppel 

table of contents trial is scheduled to begin on april  the company is confident that its patent claims have merit  and if the parties do not reach a settlement  the company intends to vigorously pursue its claims to judgment 
the company is involved in two other pending suits with synergetics 
the first suit  entitled synergetics  inc v 
peregrine surgical  ltd  innovatech surgical  inc  and iridex corporation  is case no 
cv in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
synergetics filed suit against the company on april   by adding the company as a defendant to a then existing lawsuit against the other two defendants 
synergetics alleges that the company infringes its patent and seeks injunctive relief  monetary damages  treble damages  costs and attorneys fees 
on june  the company filed its response to synergetics pleading  denying synergetics claims and asserting counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that it does not infringe synergetics patent 
synergetics responded to the company s counterclaims on july   denying them 
on august   the case was reassigned to district judge thomas golden 
judge golden has set a status conference for may  there have not yet been any significant proceedings in this case 
the second suit  entitled synergetics  inc v 
iridex corporation  is pending in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri 
synergetics filed suit against the company on february   alleging that the company s assertion of patent infringement against synergetics constitutes a violation of the federal antitrust laws and also abuse of process in missouri 
the company has not yet been served with a copy of the summons and complaint  which was filed under seal 
the company believes that synergetics suit lacks merit in part because the court granted the company judgment of infringement and denied synergetics motion for judgment on laches and intends to vigorously defend against synergetics claims should synergetics choose to proceed with the suit 
management believes that liabilities resulting from such proceedings  or claims which are pending or known to be threatened will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company may incur significant dedication of management resources and legal costs in connection with this lawsuit
