we originate and invest in real estate related assets that are underwritten through an integrated investment process 
we conduct our business through our subsidiaries  rait partnership and taberna  as well as through their respective subsidiaries 
rait is a self managed and self advised maryland reit 
taberna is also a maryland reit 
we acquired taberna in a merger completed in december our objective is to provide our shareholders with total returns over time  including quarterly distributions and capital appreciation  while seeking to manage the risks associated with our investment strategy 
as a result of our acquisition of taberna  we believe we have expanded our ability to originate and invest in more diversified types of real estate related assets and to finance our investments through the use of cdos to match fund our investments for their duration 
our merger with taberna increased our assets by approximately billion that will cause a significant increase  net of taberna s financing costs  in our net investment income going forward 
taberna s historical operations and business generated income and distributions for its shareholders through its net investment income and fees generated from its origination network and its cdo structuring and asset management businesses 
taberna s historical fees earned on these business  while not recognized for gaap purposes  generated significant reit taxable income and distributions for its shareholders 
since taberna s operations are only included in our operations for a small portion of  we do not believe that our historical financial statements and result of operations contained herein will be indicative of our future performance and ability to generate distributions for our shareholders 
core components of our business include a robust origination network  a disciplined credit underwriting process and  an ability to finance our business more efficiently through the use of cdo transactions 
our extensive origination network allows us to lend to real estate borrowers internationally on a secured and unsecured basis  including through trups  mortgage loans  and mezzanine lending 
a broad referral network in both north america and europe supports our origination platform 
our credit underwriting involves an extensive due diligence process that seeks to identify risks related to each proposed investment before an investment decision is made and  thereafter  to monitor each investment on a continuous basis 
as a result of our acquisition of taberna  we have acquired a platform that we believe will allow us to structure cdo transactions and similar financing arrangements to finance asset growth 
we expect that use of cdos will enable us to match the interest rates and maturities of our assets with the interest rates and maturities of our financing  thereby reducing interest rate volatility risk 
we also believe that the use of cdos will lower our cost of funds by providing access to a global network of fixed income investors and allow us to compete with larger institutions providing loan products similar to ours 
in addition  lower financing costs will allow us to generate acceptable net investment income when competing to provide financing to borrowers with lower credit risk 
our earnings are affected by a variety of industry and economic factors 
these factors include interest rate trends  rates of prepayment on mortgages underlying our mortgage portfolio  competition  and other market developments 
a variety of factors relating to our business may impact our financial condition and operating performance 
these factors include our leverage  our access to funding and borrowing capacity  our borrowing costs  our hedging activities  changes in the credit performance of the loans  securities and other assets we own  and the reit requirements and our intention to qualify for exemption from registration as an investment company under the investment company act 
our net investment income is generated primarily from the net spread  or difference  between the interest and dividend income we earn on our investment portfolio and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities 
we leverage our investments in an effort to enhance our returns 
leverage can enhance returns  but may also magnify losses 
the yield on our assets may be affected by actual prepayment rates on the assets  which may differ from our expectations of prepayment rates 
prepayments on loans and securities may be influenced by changes in market interest rates and a variety of economic  geographic and other factors beyond our control  and consequently  prepayment rates cannot be predicted with certainty 
to the extent we have acquired assets at a premium or discount  a change in prepayment rates may further impact our anticipated yield 
under certain interest rate and prepayment scenarios  we may fail to recoup fully our cost of acquisition of certain assets 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our residential mortgage portfolio will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of prepayments at comparable yields  our net investment income is likely to decline 
in periods of rising interest rates  prepayment rates on our residential mortgage portfolio will likely decrease  causing the expected duration of these investments to be extended 
if we have appropriately match funded our assets with liabilities related to our residential mortgage portfolio  an increase in interest rates should not materially impact our net investment income 
however  if we have not sufficiently match funded these assets with liabilities  a rise in interest rates could cause our net investment income to decrease as our borrowing and hedging costs increase while our interest income on those assets remains relatively constant during the fixed rate periods of the hybrid adjustable rate mortgages 
depending on how close our adjustable rate mortgages are to their interest rate reset date during their fixed rate periods  a change in interest rates may not impact prepayment as expected 
while we use hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all of the negative consequences associated with these changes 
trends that may affect our business the following trends may affect our business rising interest rate environment 
interest rates have risen with respect to the types of investments we invest in during the fiscal year ended december  our investments in securities are comprised of trups  subordinated debentures  unsecured debt securities and cmbs held by our consolidated cdo entities 
these securities bear fixed and floating interest rates 
a large portion of these fixed rate securities are hybrid instruments  which convert to floating rate securities after a five or ten year fixed rate period 
we have financed these securities through the issuance of floating rate and fixed rate cdo notes payable 
a large portion of the cdo notes payable are floating rate instruments  and we use interest rate swaps to effectively convert this floating rate debt into fixed rate debt during the period in which our investments in securities are paid at a fixed rate 
by using this hedging strategy  we believe we have effectively match funded our assets with liabilities during the fixed rate period of our investments in securities 
an increase or decrease in interest rates will generally not impact our net investment income generated by our investments in securities 
however  an increase or decrease in interest rates will affect the fair value of our investments in securities  which will generally be reflected in our financial statements as changes in other comprehensive income unless impairment of an investment occurs that is not temporary  in which case the impairment would be reflected as a charge against our earnings 
with respect to our investments in residential mortgages and commercial and mezzanine loans  we do not expect interest rate increases to materially impact our net investment income 
in the case of investments in residential mortgages  we have financed these investments through the issuance of mortgage backed securities that bear interest at rates with similar terms as those of the underlying residential mortgages  effectively match funding our investments with our liabilities 
in the case of investments in commercial and mezzanine loans  we use floating rate line of credit borrowings and long term floating rate cdo notes payable to finance our investments 
much like our investments in securities discussed above  to extent the quantity of fixed rate commercial and mezzanine loans are not directly offset by matching fixed rate cdo notes payable  we utilize interest rate swap contracts to convert our floating rate liabilities into fixed rate liabilities  effectively match funding our assets with our liabilities 
prepayment rates 
prepayment rates generally increase when interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
prepayment rates on our assets also may be affected by other factors  including  without limitation  conditions in the housing  real estate and financial markets  general economic conditions and the relative interest rates on adjustable rate and fixed rate loans 
because interest rates may continue to increase  prepayment rates may fall 
if interest rates begin to fall  triggering an increase in prepayment rates in our current residential mortgage portfolio  which is heavily weighted towards fixed rate hybrid residential mortgages  our net investment income relating to our residential mortgage portfolio would decrease 
competition 
we compete for our targeted investments 
while we expect that the size and growth of the market for our products will continue to provide us with a variety of investment opportunities  competition may have adverse effects on our business 
competition may limit the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us 
competition may also result in higher prices  lower yields and a narrower spread of yields over our borrowing costs  making it more difficult for us to acquire new investments on attractive terms and reducing the fee income we realize from the origination  structuring and management of cdos 
in addition  competition may lead us to pay a greater portion of the origination fees that we expect to collect in our future origination activities to third party investment banks and brokers that introduce investments to us in order to continue to generate new business from these sources 
critical accounting estimates and policies we consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of how we report our financial condition and results of operations because their application places the most significant demands on the judgment of our management 
our financial statements are prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition for investment income 
we recognize interest income from investments in debt and other securities  residential mortgages  commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans on a yield to maturity basis 
upon the acquisition of a loan at a discount  we assess the portions of the discount that constitutes accretable yields and non accretable differences 
the accretable yield represents the excess of our expected cash flows from the loan over the amount we paid for the loan 
that amount  the accretable yield  is accreted to interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
many of our commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans provide for the accrual of interest at specified rates which differ from current payment terms 
interest income is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible 
origination fees and direct loan origination costs are deferred and amortized to net investment income  using the effective interest method  over the contractual life of the underlying loan security or loan  in accordance with sfas no 
we recognize interest income from interests in certain securitized financial assets on an estimated effective yield to maturity basis 
management estimates the current yield on the amortized cost of the investment based on estimated cash flows after considering prepayment and credit loss experience 
revenue recognition for cdo structuring fees 
we receive structuring fees for services rendered in connection with the formation of cdo securitization entities 
the structuring fee is a contractual fee paid when the related services are completed 
the structuring fee is a negotiated fee with the investment bank acting as placement agent for the cdo securities and is capitalized by the cdo securitization entity as a deferred financing cost 
from time to time  we may decide to invest in the debt or equity securities issued by cdo securitization entities 
we evaluate our investment in these entities under fin r to determine whether the entity is a vie  and  if so  whether or not we are the primary beneficiary 
if we determine we are the primary beneficiary  we will consolidate the accounts of the cdo securitization entity into our consolidated financial statements 
upon consolidation  we eliminate intercompany transactions  specifically the structuring fees and deferred financing costs paid 
revenue recognition for fees and other income 
we generate fee and other income  through our various subsidiaries  by providing a ongoing asset management services to cdo investment portfolios under cancellable management agreements  b providing or arranging to provide financing to our borrowers  and c providing financial consulting to our borrowers 
we recognize revenue for these activities when the fees are fixed or determinable  evidenced by an arrangement  collection is reasonably assured and the services under the arrangement have been provided 
cdo asset management fees are an administrative cost of a cdo entity and are paid by the cdo administrative trustee on behalf of its investors 
these asset management fees are recognized when earned and are paid quarterly 
asset management fees from consolidated cdos are eliminated in consolidation 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
when we obtain an explicit or implicit interest in an entity  we evaluate the entity to determine if the entity is a vie  and  if so  whether or not we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie  in accordance with fin r 
generally  we consolidate vies where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary or non vies which we control 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the variable interest holder that absorbs the majority of the variability in the expected losses or receives the majority of the residual returns of the vie 
when determining the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider the aggregate of our explicit and implicit variable interests as a single variable interest of the vie 
if our single variable interest absorbs the majority of the variability in the expected losses of the vie or receives the majority of the vie s residual returns  we are considered the primary beneficiary of the vie 
in the case of non vies or vies i we are not deemed to be the primary beneficiary and ii we do not control the entity  but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the entity  we account for our investment under the equity method ie  at cost  increased or decreased by our share of the earnings or losses  less distributions 
we reconsider our determination of whether an entity is a vie and whether we are the primary beneficiary of such vie if certain events occur 
we have determined that certain special purpose trusts formed by issuers of trups to issue such securities are vies  which we refer to as trust vies  and that the holder of the majority of the trups issued by the trust vies would be the primary beneficiary of  and would consolidate  the trust vies 
in most instances  we are the primary beneficiary of the trust vies because we hold  either explicitly or implicitly  the majority of the trups issued by the trust vies 
certain trups issued by trust vie entities are initially financed directly by cdos or through our warehouse facilities 
under the warehouse agreements  we are required to deposit cash collateral with the investment bank providing the warehouse facility and as a result  we bear the first dollar risk of loss up to our collateral amount if an investment held under the warehouse facility is liquidated at a loss 
this arrangement causes us to hold an implicit interest in the trust vies that have issued the trups held by our warehouse providers 
the primary assets of the trust vies are subordinated debentures issued by the sponsors of the trust vies in exchange for the trups proceeds 
these subordinated debentures have terms that mirror the trups issued by the trust vies 
upon consolidation of the trust vies  these subordinated debentures  which are assets of the trust vies  are included in our financial statements and the related trups are eliminated 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
classifying notes received for capital stock  subordinated debentures issued to trust vies as payment for common equity securities issued by trust vies are recorded net of the common equity securities issued 
transfers of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
we account for transfers of financial assets and the extinguishment of related liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
 as either sales or financings 
to the extent we acquire assets that are treated as financings under sfas no 
 we record our investment at amortized cost and categorize the investment as either a security related receivable or mortgage related receivable in our financial statements 
one of the criteria that must be met for a transfer of financial assets to be treated as a sale is that the transferor must relinquish effective control over the assets and retain no continuing involvement with the assets 
if we are the primary beneficiary of a vie that issues trups  and thereby consolidate the vie  upon a subsequent transfer of the trups to a cdo entity in which we invest or that we manage  we may not qualify for sale accounting 
in that event  we would continue to consolidate the vie assets 
although the warehouse obligations would be extinguished by the cdo s purchase of the trups  the cdo debt obligations would be recorded in consolidation 
investments 
we invest primarily in debt securities  residential mortgage portfolios and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and may invest in other types of real estate related assets 
we account for our investments in securities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
 and designate each investment as a trading security  an available for sale security  or a held to maturity security based on management s intent at the time of acquisition 
under sfas no 
 trading securities are recorded at their fair value each reporting period with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of earnings 
available for sale securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
fair value is based primarily on quoted market prices from independent pricing sources when available for actively traded securities or discounted cash flow analyses developed by management using current interest rates and other market data for securities without an active market 
management s estimate of fair value is subject to a high degree of variability based upon market conditions and management assumptions 
upon the sale of an available for sale security  the realized gain or loss on the sale will be recorded as a component of earnings in the respective period 
held to maturity investments are carried at amortized cost at each reporting period 
we account for our investments in subordinated debentures owned by trust vies that we consolidate as available for sale securities 
these vies have no ability to sell  pledge  transfer or otherwise encumber the trust or the assets of the trust until such subordinated debenture s maturity 
we account for investments in securities where the transfer meets the criteria under sfas no 
as a financing  at amortized cost 
our investments in security related receivables represent securities that were transferred to cdo securitization entities in which the transferors maintained some level of continuing involvement 
we account for our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans at amortized cost 
the carrying value of these investments is adjusted for origination discounts or premiums  non refundable fees and direct costs for originating loans which are amortized into income on a level yield basis over the terms of the loans 
mortgage related receivables represent loan receivables secured by residential mortgages  the legal title to which is held by our trust subsidiaries 
these residential mortgages were transferred to the trust subsidiaries in transactions accounted for as financings under sfas no 
mortgage related receivables maintain all of the economic attributes of the underlying residential mortgages and all benefits or risks of that ownership inure to the trust subsidiary 
management uses its judgment to determine whether an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in value 
if management determines that an investment has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value by a charge to earnings  and we establish a new cost basis for the investment 
if a security that is available for sale sustains an other than temporary impairment  the identified impairment is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
our evaluation of an other than temporary decline is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that we consider in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the estimated fair value of the investment in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the related entity  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the fair value of the investment 
we maintain an allowance for losses on our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans 
our allowance for losses is based on management s evaluation of known losses and inherent risks in the portfolios  for example  historical and industry loss experience  economic conditions and trends  estimated fair values  the quality of collateral and other relevant factors 
specific allowances for losses are established for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow  the loan s estimated market price or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
the allowance is increased by charges to operations and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
goodwill and intangible assets 
goodwill on the our consolidated balance sheet represents the amounts paid by us in excess of the fair value of the net assets acquired from business acquisitions accounted for under sfas no 
 business combinations 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized to expense and rather is analyzed for impairment 
we measure our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or when events indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet represent identifiable intangibles acquired in business acquisitions 
we amortize identified intangible assets to expense over their estimated lives using the straight line method 
we measure our intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  for impairment on an annual basis or when events indicate that the intangible assets are impaired 
we expect to record amortization expense of intangible assets as follows by fiscal year million  million  million  million  million and million thereafter 
accounting for off balance sheet arrangements 
we maintain warehouse financing arrangements with various investment banks and engage in cdo securitizations 
prior to the completion of a cdo securitization  our warehouse providers acquire investments in accordance with the terms of the warehouse facilities 
we are paid the difference between the interest earned on the investments and the interest charged by the warehouse providers from the dates on which the respective investments were acquired 
we bear the first dollar risk of loss  up to our warehouse deposit amount  if i an investment funded through the warehouse facility becomes impaired or ii a cdo is not completed by the end of the warehouse period  and in either case  the warehouse provider is required to liquidate the securities at a loss 
these off balance sheet arrangements are not consolidated by us because our risk of loss is generally limited to the cash collateral held by the warehouse providers and our warehouse facilities are not special purpose vehicles 
however  since we hold an implicit variable interest in many entities funded under our warehouse facilities  we often do consolidate the trust vies while the trups they issue are held on the warehouse lines 
the economic return earned from these warehouse facilities is considered a non hedge derivative and is recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
changes in fair value are reflected in earnings in the respective period 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
we may use derivative financial instruments to hedge all or a portion of the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings  consistent with our intention to qualify as a reit 
certain of the techniques used to hedge exposure to interest rate fluctuations may also be used to protect against declines in the market value of assets that result from general trends in debt markets 
the principal objective of such agreements is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with our operating and financial structure as well as to hedge specific anticipated transactions 
the counterparties to these contractual arrangements are major financial institutions with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties  we are potentially exposed to credit loss 
however  because of the high credit ratings of our counterparties  we do not anticipate that any of the counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  or sfas no 
 we measure each derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts at fair value and record it in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges and derivatives not designated as hedges  the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the changes in the fair value of the effective portions of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income 
amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings in the period the underlying hedged item affects earnings 
changes in the ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings 
income taxes 
we and taberna have elected to be taxed as a reit and to comply with the related provisions of the internal revenue code 
accordingly  we generally will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent of our current distributions to shareholders and as long as certain asset  income and share ownership tests are met 
if we were to fail to meet these requirements  we would be subject to us federal income tax which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and amounts available for distribution to our shareholders 
management believes that all of the criteria to maintain our reit qualification have been met for all periods  but there can be no assurance that these criteria have been met for these periods or will continue to be met in subsequent periods 
we maintain various trss which may be subject to us federal  state and local income taxes 
from time to time  these trss generate taxable income from intercompany transactions 
the trs entities generate taxable revenue from fees for services provided to cdo entities 
some of these fees paid to the trs entities are capitalized as deferred costs by the cdo entities 
in consolidation  these fees are eliminated when the cdo entity is included in the consolidated group 
nonetheless  all income taxes are expenses and are paid by the trss in the year in which the taxable revenue is received 
these income taxes are not eliminated when the related revenue is eliminated in consolidation 
reit taxable income to qualify as a reit  we are required to annually make distributions to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains 
in addition  to avoid certain us federal excise taxes  we are required to annually make distributions to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to certain designated percentages of our net taxable income 
because we expect to make distributions based on the foregoing requirements  and not based on our earnings computed in accordance with gaap  we expect that our distributions may at times be more or less than its reported earnings as computed in accordance with gaap 
total taxable income and reit taxable income are non gaap financial measurements  and do not purport to be an alternative to reported net income determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
our total taxable income represents the aggregate amount of taxable income generated by us and by our domestic and foreign trss 
reit taxable income is calculated under us federal tax laws in a manner that  in certain respects  differs from the calculation of net income pursuant to gaap 
reit taxable income excludes the undistributed taxable income of our domestic trss  which is not included in reit taxable income until distributed to us 
subject to certain trs value limitations  there is no requirement that our domestic trss distribute their earnings to us 
reit taxable income  however  generally includes the taxable income of our foreign trss because we will generally be required to recognize and report our taxable income on a current basis 
since we are structured as a reit and the internal revenue code requires that we distribute substantially all of our net taxable income in the form of distributions to our shareholders  we believe that presenting investors with the information management uses to calculate our net taxable income is useful to investors in understanding the amount of the minimum distributions that we must make to our shareholders so as to comply with the rules set forth in the internal revenue code 
because not all companies use identical calculations  this presentation of total taxable income and reit taxable income may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures prepared and reported by other companies 
the table below reconciles the differences between reported net income and total taxable income and reit taxable income for the three years ended december  dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december net income available to common shares  as reported add deduct provision for losses tax gains on sales in excess of reported gains domestic trs book to total taxable income differences income tax benefit origination fees eliminated in consolidation stock compensation and other temporary tax differences cdo investments aggregate book to taxable income differences accretion of loan discounts other book to tax differences taberna s undistributed earnings pre merger total taxable income less taxable income attributable to domestic trs entities plus dividends paid by domestic trs entities estimated reit taxable income prior to deduction for dividends paid amounts reflect the aggregate book to total taxable income differences and are primarily comprised of a unrealized gains on interest rate hedges within cdo entities that taberna consolidated  b amortization of original issue discounts and debt issuance costs and c differences in tax year ends between taberna and its cdo investments 
amount reflects the undistributed earnings of taberna for the period from january  through december  these undistributed earnings  as well as taberna s reit taxable income generated from december  through december   were declared as a dividend to rait  taberna s sole common shareholder  in december and was paid in january results of operations on december   we acquired taberna upon the completion of our stock for stock merger 
as a result of this merger  the results of our operations for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to the results of operations for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue investment interest income increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  of the increase  million was attributable to the interest earning assets acquired from taberna with the remaining increase associated with the increase in our commercial and mezzanine loans from december  investment interest expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was attributable to the interest bearing liabilities assumed from taberna with the remaining increase attributable to our increased borrowings under our lines of credit and the issuance of our cdo notes payable in november  through rait i 
our provision for loan loss related to investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables acquired from taberna on december  and our commercial mortgage and mezzanine loans 
the provision for loan loss increased to approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to zero for the year ended december  we maintain an allowance for loss on our investments in residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans and other loans 
specific allowances for losses are established for impaired loans based on a comparison of the recorded carrying value of the loan to either the present value of the loan s expected cash flow  the loan s estimated market price or the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral 
based on our evaluation of our portfolios of loans and the adequacy of our allowance  we increased our allowance for losses by million during of this  approximately million relates specifically to our pool of residential mortgages acquired from taberna on december  and is based on statistical evidence of historical losses on homogenous pools of residential mortgages 
the change in fair value of free standing derivatives represents the earnings on our first dollar risk of loss associated with our warehouse facilities 
our free standing derivatives during were acquired from taberna on december  as of december   our first dollar risk of loss in our warehouses  identified as warehouse deposits on our consolidated balance sheet  was million 
the change in fair value of these free standing derivative instruments was million 
our first dollar risk of loss  or warehouse deposit  requirement associated with our warehouse facilities range from to rental income increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to increased occupancy at our consolidated properties and the acquisition of one property in fee income and other increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to million of increased fees on commercial and mezzanine loans resulting from our borrowers simultaneously or subsequently obtaining third party financing and million of increased financial consulting fees for financial consulting services provided to our borrowers before financing transactions commenced or were committed 
expenses compensation expenses 
compensation expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for year ended december  this increase is due to million of amortization expense associated with restricted shares assumed from taberna that did not fully vest on december  and million of expense associated with the supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp  for our chairman  betsy z 
cohen  and increased other compensation expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is due to million of general and administrative expenses related to the operations acquired from taberna and million of increased legal and accounting professional fees 
real estate operating expenses  depreciation 
real estate operating expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to interest paid on million of financing obtained during relating to one real estate investment 
depreciation expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  intangible amortization 
intangible amortization represents the amortization of intangible assets acquired from taberna on december  the total intangibles acquired were approximately million and have useful lives ranging from to years 
amortization for the period from the acquisition of taberna  on december   through december  was million 
other income expenses interest and other income 
interest and other income increased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to million of interest and other income associated with restricted cash balances acquired from taberna and higher average cash balances invested with financial institutions with higher yielding interest bearing accounts during year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  unrealized gain on interest rate hedges 
unrealized gains on interest rate hedges was approximately million for the year ended december  and entirely related to interest rate hedges assumed from taberna on december  at acquisition  we designated the interest rate swaps assumed from taberna that were associated with cdo notes payable and repurchase agreements as hedges pursuant to sfas no 
at designation  these interest rate swaps had a fair value not equal to zero 
however  we concluded  at designation  that these hedging arrangements were highly effective during their term using regression analysis and determined that the hypothetical derivative method would be used in measuring any ineffectiveness 
at december   we updated our regression analysis and concluded that these hedging arrangements were still highly effective during their remaining term and used the hypothetical derivative method in measuring the ineffective portions of these hedging arrangements 
as a result  we recorded a gain of approximately million associated with the ineffective portions of these hedging arrangements 
management cannot ensure that these off market interest rate swaps will be highly effective in the future and further ineffectiveness  either unrealized gains or unrealized losses  maybe recorded in earnings 
equity in loss of equity method investments 
equity in loss of equity method investments was a loss of million for the year ended december  minority interest 
minority interest represents the earnings of consolidated entities allocated to third parties 
minority interest increased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  from less than million for the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the minority interests assumed from taberna 
taberna s ownership of its consolidated cdos ranged from to of the preferred shares issued by such cdos 
provision for income taxes 
taberna maintains several domestic trs entities that are subject to us federal and state and local income taxes 
for the period from the date of acquisition of taberna through december   the provision for income taxes was a benefit of million

income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations represent the revenue  expenses  and gains from the sale of properties either held for sale or sold during the years ended december  and income from discontinued operations increased million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the timing of the sales of the properties 
the income from discontinued operations reported for the year ended december  includes an entire year of property operations for four of the real estate investments that we subsequently sold in three of the properties were sold in the first half of  therefore the income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  includes less than six months of property operations for those three properties 
in addition  the income from discontinued operations reported for the year ended december  reflects the gain recognized on the sale of each property in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue investment interest income increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the following million of interest earned on loans totalling million originated between january  and december   offset by million of reduced interest associated with loans  totalling million  that were repaid during the same period  the accretion into income of million of appreciation interests for which we collected cash relating to five loans that were repaid during the same period  an increase of million in accretable yield relating to two loans where we have appreciation interests  a decrease of million of accretable yield due to the consolidation of a property underlying one of our loans pursuant to fin r  and million of interest income accruing on six preferred equity investments acquired between january  and december  totalling million  partially offset by million of reduced interest income from the disposition of four preferred equity investments during the same period 
investment interest expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the establishment and utilization of million in additional availability on new and existing lines of credit and senior indebtedness relating to loans  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense associated with the payoff of million of senior indebtedness relating to loans 
rental income increased approximately million  or to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to the consolidation of one real estate interest in august  partially offset by the disposition of one consolidated real estate interest in june fee income and other increased approximately million  or to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  expenses compensation expenses 
compensation expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for year ended december  this increase is primarily due to a grant of  phantom shares and  phantom units pursuant to our equity compensation plan in  as compared to the grant of  phantom units pursuant to our equity compensation plan in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  and real estate operating expenses  depreciation 
real estate operating expenses increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the net effect of the consolidation of one real estate interest in august  partially offset by the disposition of one consolidated real estate interest in june  as discussed above 
depreciation expense increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the net effect of the consolidation of one real estate interest in august  partially offset by the disposition of one consolidated real estate interest in june  as discussed above 
other income expenses interest and other income 
interest and other income increased approximately million to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  gain loss on sale of assets 
gain loss on sale of assets decreased million to a loss of million for the year ended december  from a gain of million for the year ended december  this decrease is attributable to specific  non routine  transactions that occurred during the years ended december  and in december  the general partner of a limited partnership in which we held an limited partnership interest entered into an agreement to sell the apartment building that it owned 
our share of the net sales proceeds was approximately million and the book value of our unconsolidated interest was million  thereby resulting in a loss on sale of  for the year ended december  in june we recognized million relating to our appreciation interest in one of our investments 
because we had a controlling interest in the entity that owned the real estate  we accounted for our equity interest on a consolidated basis 
accordingly  when our appreciation interest was realized with the economic intent of generating additional interest income  under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  we recognized income as gain on sale of real estate interest 
as of september  we had restructured this investment into a mezzanine loan  and as of december  it had been fully repaid 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the earnings of consolidated entities allocated to third parties 
minority interest was less than million for the years ended december  and income from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations represent the revenue  expenses  and gains from the sale of properties either held for sale as of or sold during the all years ended december  income from discontinued operations decreased million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  pay distributions and other general business needs 
we believe our available cash balances  funds available under our warehouse facilities and other financing arrangements  and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our liquidity requirements for the next months 
we may use short term repurchase agreements  lines of credit  term debt and other forms of generic financing to finance our operations 
should our liquidity needs exceed our available sources of liquidity  we believe that our cdo and investment securities could be sold directly or as part of cdo transactions or other securitizations to raise additional cash 
we expect to continue to expand our business and may have to arrange for additional sources of capital through the issuance of debt or equity or additional bank borrowings to fund that growth 
we may not be able to obtain any additional financing when we desire to do so  or may not be able to obtain desired financing on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
if we fail to obtain additional financing  the pace of our growth could be reduced 
our primary cash requirements are as follows to distribute a minimum of of our net taxable income and to make investments in a manner that enables us to maintain our qualification as a reit  to provide cash collateral for our warehouse agreements  to make investments in cdos or other securities  to repay our indebtedness under our repurchase agreements  to pay costs associated with future borrowings  including interest  incurred to finance our investment strategies  to pay employee salaries and incentive compensation  and to pay us federal  state  and local taxes of our trss 
we intend to meet these short term liquidity requirements through the following the use of our cash and cash equivalent balances of million as of december   cash generated from operating activities  including net investment income from our investment portfolio  fee income received by taberna capital and rait partnership through their collateral management agreements and cdo structuring fees  and origination fees received by taberna securities 
the collateral management fees as well as the structuring fees paid by cdo entities  although eliminated for financial reporting purposes with respect to the consolidated cdos  represent cash inflows to us  and  after the payment of income taxes  the remaining cash may be used for our operating expenses or distributions  and proceeds from future borrowings or offerings of our common and preferred shares 
cash flows as of december  and  we maintained cash and cash equivalents of approximately million and million  respectively 
our cash and cash equivalents were generated from the following activities amounts in thousands for the year ended december cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net change in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period cash and cash equivalents at end of period our principal source of cash flows is from our financing activities  specifically the issuance of cdo notes to finance our investments in securities and loans 
our increased cash flow from operating activities is primarily the result of our increased investment portfolio when compared to our investment portfolio 
the increased cash outflow from our investing activities in as compared to is primarily attributable to our investments in securities resulting from our acquisition of taberna 
the increased cash inflow from our financing activities resulted from the issuance of cdo notes payable in november when we closed rait i  a cdo comprised of commercial and mezzanine loans 
capitalization debt financing 
we maintain various forms of short term and long term financing arrangements 
generally  these financing agreements are generally collateralized by assets within cdos or mortgage securitizations

rates generally follow the terms of the underlying mortgages  which are fixed for a period of time and variable thereafter 
we intend to re negotiate and extend our repurchase agreements as they mature 
a repurchase agreements and other indebtedness we were party to repurchase agreements that had approximately billion in borrowings outstanding as of december  we use repurchase agreements to finance our investments in subordinated interests in mortgage securitizations that we sponsor  residential mortgages prior to their long term financing through mortgage securitizations  and other securities  including remic interests 
our repurchase agreements contain standard market terms and generally renew on a monthly basis 
as these investments incur prepayments or change in fair value  we are required to ratably reduce our borrowings outstanding under repurchase agreements 
borrowings under repurchase agreements during the year ended december  bore interest at one month or three month libor plus a weighted average spread ranging from to basis points 
included in the above amounts is a credit agreement between taberna and an investment bank that will provide up to million of financing to purchase billion of rmbs  cmbs and other real estate related securities on a short term basis until cdo notes payable are issued to finance the investments on a longer term basis 
the credit agreement requires the payment of interest monthly at one month libor plus basis points 
the credit agreement will terminate upon the earlier of april  or the issuance of cdo notes payable 
the borrowings under the credit agreement are non recourse to us 
as of december   we were party to several secured lines of credit that provide up to million of borrowing capacity 
at december   we had million outstanding under these secured lines of credit 
borrowing availability under these lines of credit is based on specified percentages of the value of eligible assets 
our lines of credit bear interest at various floating rates ranging from libor plus to libor plus as of december  one of these lines of credit provides up to million of capacity as of december  our million secured line of credit will terminate on october   unless we extend the term an additional year upon the satisfaction of specified conditions 
our ability to borrow under this line of credit is subject to our ongoing compliance with a number of financial and other covenants 
on december   we amended this line of credit to redefine and restructure certain of the financial and non financial covenants 
this credit facility also contains customary events of default  including a cross default provision 
if an event of default occurs  all of our obligations under the credit facility may be declared immediately due and payable 
for events of default relating to insolvency and receivership  all outstanding obligations automatically become due and payable 
as of december   million of our million line of credit borrowings outstanding were attributable to this line of credit 
as of december   we had other indebtedness outstanding relating to loans payable on consolidated real estate interests  senior loan participations and other term loans 
these loans are secured by specific consolidated real estate interests and commercial loans included in our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   million of our commercial loans and consolidated real estate interests were pledged as collateral for our other indebtedness 
b mortgage backed securities issued we finance our investments in residential mortgages through the issuance of mortgage backed securities by non qualified special purpose securitization entities  pursuant to sfas no 
 that are owner trusts 
the mortgage backed securities issued maintain the identical terms of the underlying residential mortgage loans with respect to maturity  duration of the fixed rate period and floating rate reset provision after the expiration of the fixed rate period 
principal payments on the mortgage backed securities issued are match funded by the receipt of principal payments on the residential mortgage loans 
although residential mortgage loans  which have been securitized  are consolidated on our balance sheet  the non qualified special purpose entities that hold such residential mortgage loans are separate legal entities 
consequently  the assets of these non qualified special purpose entities collateralize the debt of such entities and are not available to our creditors 
as of december   approximately billion of principal amount residential mortgages and mortgage related receivables collateralized our mortgage backed securities issued 
c trust preferred obligations trust preferred obligations finance subordinated debentures acquired by trust vies that are consolidated by us for the portion of the total trups that are owned by entities outside of the consolidated group 
these trust preferred obligations bear interest at either variable or fixed rates until maturity  generally years from the date of issuance 
the trust vie has the ability to prepay the trust preferred obligation at any time  without prepayment penalty  after five years 
we do not control the timing or ultimate payment of the trust preferred obligations 
d cdo notes payable cdo notes payable represent notes payable issued by cdo entities used to finance the acquisition of trups  unsecured reit notes  cmbs securities  commercial mortgages  mezzanine loans  and other loans 
generally  cdo notes payable are comprised of various classes of notes payable  with each class bearing interest at variable or fixed rates

equity financing 
in  we issued million shares of our series a cumulative redeemable preferred shares of beneficial interest series a preferred shares 
the series a preferred shares accrue cumulative cash dividends at a rate of per year of the liquidation preference  have no maturity date and we are not required to redeem the series a preferred shares at any time

on september   we issued  common shares in a public offering at an offering price of per share 
after offering costs  including the underwriter s discount  and expenses of approximately million  we received approximately million of net proceeds 
on december   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of taberna 
the acquisition was a stock for stock merger in which we issued common shares for each taberna common share 
we issued  common shares  including  unvested restricted shares issued to employees of taberna in exchange for their unvested restricted shares that did not fully vest upon the completion of the acquisition 
the value of the unvested restricted shares was approximately million based on the price of our common shares on the date of the merger  or per share  was excluded from the total purchase price consideration and will be amortized to compensation expense as the shares vest over the remaining terms of the individual awards 
off balance sheet arrangements and commitments we maintain arrangements with various investment banks regarding cdo securitizations and warehouse facilities 
prior to the completion of a cdo securitization  investments are acquired by the warehouse providers in accordance with the warehouse facilities 
pursuant to the terms of the warehouse agreements  we receive the difference between the interest earned on the investments under the warehouse facilities and the interest charged by the warehouse facilities from the dates on which the respective securities are acquired 
under the warehouse agreements  we are required to deposit cash collateral with the warehouse provider and as a result  we bear the first dollar risk of loss  and in some cases share the first dollar risk of loss  up to our warehouse deposit  if i an investment funded through the warehouse facility becomes impaired or ii a cdo is not completed by the end of the warehouse period  and in either case  if the warehouse facility is required to liquidate the securities at a loss 
upon the completion of a cdo securitization  the cash collateral held by the warehouse provider is returned to us 
the terms of the warehouse facilities are generally at least nine months 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash collateral held by warehouse providers pursuant to warehouse facilities 
these arrangements are deemed to be derivative financial instruments and are recorded by us at fair value each accounting period with the change in fair value recorded in earnings 
these arrangements represent our only off balance sheet arrangements 
a summary of these arrangements is as follows dollars in thousands warehouse facility warehouse availability funding as of december  remaining availability maturity merrill lynch international    january to july bear  stearns co 
inc    march total the financing costs of these warehouse facilities are based on one month libor plus a spread of basis points 
inflation we believe that inflationary increases in operating expenses will generally be offset by future revenue increases from originating new securities and structuring and managing additional cdo transactions 
we believe that the risk that market interest rates may have on our floating rate debt instruments as a result of future increases caused by inflation is primarily offset by our financing strategy to match the terms of our investment assets with the terms of our liabilities and  to the extent necessary  through the use of hedging instruments 
contractual commitments the table below summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands repurchase agreements and other indebtedness mortgage backed securities issued  unpaid principal balance trust preferred obligations cdo notes payable funding commitments to borrowers a commitments to purchase securities and loans b operating lease agreements total a amounts represent the commitments we have made to fund borrowers in our existing lending arrangements as of december  b amounts reflect our consolidated cdo s requirement to purchase additional collateral in order to complete the ramp up collateral balances 
of this amount   has been advanced through cdo notes payable and is included in our restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk related to our investments in debt instruments  trups  subordinated debentures  residential mortgages  commercial mortgages and mezzanine loans 
our primary market risk is that we are exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rates may be affected by economic  geo political  monetary and fiscal policy  market supply and demand and other factors generally outside our control  and such factors may be highly volatile 
our interest rate risk sensitive assets and liabilities and financial derivatives will be typically held for long term investment and not held for sale purposes 
our intent in structuring cdo transactions and other securitizations is to limit interest rate risk through our financing strategy of matching the terms of its investment assets with the terms of its liabilities and  to the extent necessary  through the use of hedging instruments 
we intend to reduce interest rate and funding risk  allowing us to focus on managing credit risk through our disciplined underwriting process and recurring credit analysis 
we make investments that are either floating rate or fixed rate 
our floating rate investments will generally be priced at a fixed spread over an index such as libor that reprices either quarterly or every days 
given the frequency of future price changes in our floating rate investments  changes in interest rates are not expected to have a material effect on the value of these investments 
increases or decreases in libor will have a corresponding increase or decrease in its interest income and the match funded interest expense  thereby reducing the net earnings impact on its overall portfolio 
in the event that long term interest rates increase  the value of our fixed rate investments would be diminished 
we may consider hedging this risk in the future if the benefit outweighs the cost of the hedging strategy 
such changes in interest rates would not have a material effect on the income from these investments 
as of december   we entered into various interest rate swap agreements to hedge variable cash flows associated with cdo notes payable and repurchase agreements 
these cash flow hedges have an aggregate notional value of billion and are used to swap the variable cash flows associated with variable rate cdo notes payable and repurchase agreements into fixed rate payments for five and ten year periods 
as of december   the interest rate swaps had an aggregate liability fair value of million 
changes in the fair value of the ineffective portions of interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps that were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
are recorded in earnings 
the following table summarizes the change in net investment income for a month period  and the change in the net fair value of our investments and indebtedness assuming an instantaneous increase or decrease of basis points in the libor interest rate curve  both adjusted for the effects of our interest rate hedging activities net assets liabilities subject to interest rate sensitivity basis point increase basis point decrease dollars in thousands net investment income from variable rate investments and indebtedness net fair value of fixed rate investments and indebtedness we seek to manage our credit risk through the underwriting processes that we perform in advance of acquiring an investment and our ongoing credit analysis and monitoring procedures 
we make investments that are denominated in us dollars  or if made in another currency we may enter into currency swaps to convert the investment into a us dollar equivalent 
we may be unable to match the payment characteristics of the investment with the terms of the currency swap to fully eliminate all currency risk and such currency swaps may not be available on acceptable terms and conditions based upon a cost benefit analysis
