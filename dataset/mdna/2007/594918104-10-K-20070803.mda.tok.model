for fiscal year  dividends and interest income increased due to higher interest rates received on our fixed income investments  partially offset by a decline in the average balance of dividend and interest bearing investments as a result of the billion special dividend paid on december   and stock repurchases made throughout fiscal year for fiscal year  net gains on investments increased primarily due to lower other than temporary impairments and gains on sales of fixed income investments in the current period as compared to losses in fiscal year  partly offset by fewer gains on the sale of equity investments 
other than temporary impairments in fiscal year were not material and were million in fiscal year net gains on investments decreased in fiscal year primarily due to increased net losses on sales of fixed income investments  higher other than temporary impairments  and fewer net gains on equity investments in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year for fiscal year  other than temporary impairments were million  as compared to million in fiscal year the increase in other than temporary impairments in fiscal year was driven by planned sales of certain investments in an unrealized loss position in order to raise funds for the billion tender offer announced on july  investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  among other factors  we evaluate general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
we lend certain fixed income and equity securities to increase investment returns 
the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our balance sheet 
collateral and or security interest is determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower 
cash collateral is recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability 
we anticipate that the magnitude of securities lent under this program will remain relatively consistent during the fiscal year 
we use derivative instruments to manage exposures to interest rates  equity prices  and foreign currency markets and to facilitate portfolio diversification 
derivative losses during fiscal were primarily driven by net losses in time value on foreign currency contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues 
during fiscal year  we experienced lower net losses on derivatives as compared to fiscal year primarily due to net gains on non designated equity derivatives in fiscal as compared to net losses in fiscal and higher net gains on commodity positions in fiscal driven by increases in the related commodity indices 
these gains were partially offset by higher net losses in time value on foreign exchange contracts used to hedge anticipated foreign currency revenues and higher net losses on interest rate derivative contracts in fiscal net derivative losses in fiscal year were primarily related to losses on equity derivatives  interest rate derivatives  and foreign currency contracts  partly offset by gains related to commodity positions used to provide portfolio diversification 
gains and losses arising from derivatives not designated as accounting hedges are in large part economically offset by unrealized losses and gains  respectively  in the underlying securities which are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
commodity derivatives are held for the purpose of portfolio diversification

unearned revenue unearned revenue from volume licensing programs represents customer billings  paid either upfront or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage period  that are accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized ratably over the billing coverage period

the acquisition is expected to be completed in august recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation provides a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin no 
 the company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin no 
is effective for us beginning july  based on our current assessment  the adoption of fin no 
is expected to decrease beginning retained earnings by million to million upon adoption 
in june  the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force eitf consensus on eitf issue no

table of contents part ii item arrangement over the requisite service period 
eitf issue no 
is effective for us beginning july  the cumulative effect of the application of this consensus on prior period results should be recognized through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
elective retrospective application is also permitted 
we do not expect the application of this consensus to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in fiscal year  we adopted staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements 
sab no 
requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet iron curtain and an income statement rollover approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective for us beginning july  we currently are assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 
would have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for us beginning july   although early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  impairment of goodwill  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for legal contingencies  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
for some of our products  customers receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis 
the fair value of these elements is recognized over the estimated life cycle for the windows xp and previous pc operating systems 
for windows vista  there are no significant undelivered elements and accordingly  no license revenue is deferred for windows vista sales 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and sab topic m  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we employ a systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is page 
table of contents part ii item recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
if market  industry  and or investee conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july for us and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
this requires significant judgments including estimation of future cash flows  which is dependent on internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which cash flows will occur  and determination of our weighted average cost of capital 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the combination 
we evaluate our reporting units on an annual basis and  if necessary  reassign goodwill using a relative fair value allocation approach 
we account for research and development costs in accordance with applicable accounting pronouncements  including sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas no 
specifies that costs incurred internally in researching and developing a computer software product should be charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our software products is reached after all high risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing 
this is generally shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
we determined that technological feasibility was reached with windows vista and the microsoft office system during the second quarter of fiscal year and accordingly  we capitalized approximately million of software development costs 
the amortization of these costs will be included in cost of revenue over the estimated life of the products 
previously  costs incurred prior to technological feasibility were not material and were expensed as incurred 
the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency such as a legal proceeding or claim should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our results of operations  financial position  or our cash flows 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected dividends 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
page 
table of contents part ii item if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we account for product warranties in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we provide for the estimated costs of hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized 
for hardware warranty  we estimate the costs based on historical and projected product failure rates  historical and projected repair costs  and knowledge of specific product failures if any 
the specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and country in which we do business  but generally include technical support  parts  and labor over a period generally ranging from days to three years 
for software  we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes  such as security patches  over the life of the software 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  fixed income  equity  and commodity price risks 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily with option contracts 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
fixed income securities and interest rate derivatives are subject primarily to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio and equity derivatives are subject to price risk  and are generally not hedged 
however  we use put call collars to hedge our price risk on certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 
commodity derivatives held for the purpose of portfolio diversification are subject to commodity price risk 
we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model used for currencies  equities  and commodities is geometric brownian motion  which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures 
for interest rate risk  exposures such as key rate durations and spread durations are used in calculations that reflect the principle that fixed income security prices revert to maturity value over time 
var is calculated by computing the exposures of each holding s market value to a range of over  equity  fixed income  foreign exchange  and commodity risk factors 
the exposures are then used to compute the parameters of a distribution of potential changes in the total market value of all holdings  taking into account the weighted historical volatilities of the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices 
the var is then calculated as the total loss that will not be exceeded at the percentile confidence level or  alternatively stated  the losses could exceed the var in out of  cases 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  credit risk  and legal risk 
certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes 
we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars 
in these arrangements  we hedge a security s equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security s appreciation above the sold call strike 
we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes 
we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities in previous periods 
the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio 
losses in fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the specified holding period used in the var analysis 
var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 
var numbers are shown separately for interest rate  currency rate  equity price  and commodity price risks 
these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges 
we use historical data to estimate var 
given the reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
the following table sets forth the one day var for substantially all of our positions as of and for the years ended june  and in millions year ended june  risk categories june  june  average high low interest rates currency rates equity prices commodity prices total one day var for the combined risk categories was million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june   and less at june   than the sum of the separate risk categories in the above table due to the diversification benefit of the overall portfolio
