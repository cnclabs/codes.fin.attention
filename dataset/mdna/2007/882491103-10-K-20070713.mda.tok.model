the 
million tons of existing production will remain in operation 
we expect the new kiln system to start production by the end of calendar year we own long term reserves of the primary raw materials for the production of cement and aggregates

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported 
changes in the facts and circumstances could have a significant impact on the resulting financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect management s more complex judgments and estimates 
receivables 
management evaluates the ability to collect accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
a reserve for doubtful accounts is maintained based on the length of time receivables are past due or the status of a customer s financial condition 
if we are aware of a specific customer s inability to make required payments  specific amounts are added to the reserve 
environmental liabilities 
we are subject to environmental laws and regulations established by federal  state and local authorities  and make provision for the estimated costs related to compliance when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
legal contingencies 
we are defendants in lawsuits which arose in the normal course of business  and make provision for the estimated loss from any claim or legal proceeding when it is probable that a reasonably estimable liability has been incurred 
long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable and would record an impairment charge if necessary 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
goodwill 
management tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
in applying a fair value based test  estimates are made of the expected future cash flows to be derived from the applicable reporting unit 
similar to the review for impairment of other long lived assets  the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future prices for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors 
new accounting standards stock based compensation 
effective june   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  utilizing the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  we account for awards granted prior to adoption  but for which the vesting period is not complete  on a prospective basis with expense being recognized in our statement of operations based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted as of the date of grant 
options with graded vesting are valued as single awards and the related compensation cost is recognized using a straight line attribution method over the shorter of the vesting period or required service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
we use the average stock price on the date of grant to determine the fair value of restricted stock awards paid 
the impact of recognizing compensation expense related to stock options using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r for was million net of tax benefit of  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share 
the results for periods prior to june  have not been restated 
sfas no 
r also requires that the benefits associated with tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts can not be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
for  excess tax benefits recognized in financing cash flows were million 
as of may   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options  stock appreciation rights contracts  restricted stock payments and stock awards is expected to be recognized 
we currently expect to recognize approximately million of this stock based compensation expense in  million in  million in  million in   in and an aggregate of  thereafter 
inventory costs 
on june   we adopted sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this standard clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
in addition  this standard requires that the allocation of fixed production overhead costs to inventory be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the adoption of this standard did not have an effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
accounting for mining stripping costs 
on june   we adopted  emerging issues task force issue  accounting for stripping costs incurred during production in the mining industry  which requires that stripping costs incurred during the production phase of the mine be included in the costs of the inventory produced during the period that the stripping costs are incurred 
as of may   the balance of our capitalized post production stripping costs was million 
in accordance with the transition provision of eitf  we wrote off these deferred costs  effective june   and recorded a charge to retained earnings of million  net of tax benefits of million 
we will now recognize the costs of all post production stripping activity as a cost of the inventory produced during the period the stripping costs are incurred 
although dependent in part on the future level of post production stripping activity which varies from period to period  we do not expect that eitf will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations for periods following adoption 
accounting for income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which will be effective for us beginning june  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we do not expect that the adoption of this interpretation will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
this sfas is effective for us beginning june  we do not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
major maintenance activities 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this fsp addresses the planned major maintenance of assets and prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for these activities 
this fsp is effective for us beginning june  the adoption of this fsp will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources in addition to cash and cash equivalents of million at may   our sources of liquidity include cash from operations  borrowings available under our million senior secured revolving credit facility and distributions available from our investments in life insurance contracts 
senior secured revolving credit facility 
we have available a million senior secured revolving credit facility expiring in july it includes a million sub limit for letters of credit

future payments under leases exclude mineral rights which are insignificant and are generally required only for products produced 
we purchase coal and other materials for use in our cement and expanded shale and clay plants that require minimum amounts of material be purchased 
these future minimum payment amounts exclude transportation surcharges that may be imposed under certain circumstances

we expect the oro grande project will cost approximately million excluding capitalized interest related to the project  of which million has been expended as of may  the new plant is expected to begin the startup and commissioning process in the fall or early winter of convertible subordinated debentures 
during the fiscal year  million aggregate principal amount of our convertible subordinated debentures were converted into  shares of common stock 
the remaining million aggregate principal amount of debentures was redeemed 
we expect cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  available borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility and available distributions from our investments in life insurance contracts to be sufficient to provide funds for capital expenditure commitments currently estimated at million for including the expansion and modernization of our oro grande  california cement plant but excluding the expansion of our hunter  texas plant  scheduled debt payments  working capital needs and other general corporate purposes for at least the next year 
we are reviewing alternatives for funding capital expenditures for our proposed expansion of the hunter  texas cement plant cash flows net cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal year increased million from fiscal year the increase was primarily the result of higher net income and the related effects on deferred income tax and working capital items 
we also incurred a federal net operating tax loss in fiscal year that resulted in a million tax refund claim realized in fiscal year net cash provided by continuing operating activities for fiscal year decreased million from fiscal year the decrease was primarily the result of changes in working capital items and the utilization of tax benefits in fiscal year net cash used by continuing investment activities for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively

other items environmental matters we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws  regulations and permits concerning  among other matters  air emissions and wastewater discharge 
we intend to comply with these laws  regulations and permits 
however  from time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and entities asserting that we are or may be in violation of certain of these laws  regulations and permits  or from private parties alleging that our operations have injured them or their property 
based on our experience and the information currently available to us  we believe that such claims will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations

however  we continually monitor these markets and we may decide in the future to enter into long term contracts 
if we are unable to meet our requirements for fuel and electricity  we may experience interruptions in our production
