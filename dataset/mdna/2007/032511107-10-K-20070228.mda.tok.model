the company s major areas of operations are located in the united states and algeria 
the company also has activity in china  brazil  venezuela  qatar and several other countries 
the company s focus is on adding high margin oil and natural gas reserves at competitive costs and continuing to develop more efficient and effective ways of exploring for and producing oil and gas 
the primary factors that affect the company s results of operations include  among other things  commodity prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngls  production volumes  the company s ability to find additional oil and gas reserves  as well as the cost of finding reserves and changes in the levels of costs and expenses required for continuing operations

proved reserves anadarko focuses on growth and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth and future profitability depends on the cost of finding and developing oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
reserve growth can be achieved through successful exploration and development drilling  improved recovery or acquisition of producing properties 
the following discussion of proved reserves  reserve additions and revisions and future net cash flows from proved reserves includes both continuing and discontinued operations

the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
the available data reviewed include  among other things  seismic data  structure and isopach maps  well logs  production tests  material balance calculations  reservoir simulation models  reservoir pressures  individual well and field performance data  individual well and field projections  offset performance data  operating expenses  capital costs and product prices 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
reserve additions and revisions during  the company added  mmboe of proved reserves as a result of additions purchases in place  discoveries  improved recovery and extensions and revisions 
additions during  anadarko added  mmboe of proved reserves 
of this amount   mmboe were related to purchases in place primarily associated with the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western

during  anadarko added mmboe of proved reserves through successful drilling in its north american properties and the deepwater gulf of mexico  successful improved recovery operations in wyoming and minor producing property acquisitions 
the company expects the majority of future reserve additions to come from infill drilling and extensions of current fields and new discoveries onshore in north america and the deepwaters of the gulf of mexico  as well as through improved recovery operations  purchases of proved properties in strategic areas and successful exploration in international growth areas 
the success of these operations will directly impact reserve additions or revisions in the future 
revisions total revisions in were mmboe or of the beginning of year reserve base 
performance revisions of mmboe were related primarily to downward revisions of the company s reserves at the k complex in the gulf of mexico and adjustments in algeria 
price revisions in of mmboe were primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices since the end of total revisions for and were mmboe and mmboe  respectively 
revisions in related primarily to the impact of government imposed limits on production in venezuela  as well as a reduction of ngls reserves in algeria resulting from a change in project scope

the company annually reviews all puds  with a particular focus on those puds that have been booked for three or more years  to ensure that there is an appropriate plan for development 
generally  onshore united states puds are converted to proved developed reserves within two years 
certain projects  such as improved oil recovery  arctic development  deepwater development and many international programs  often take longer  sometimes beyond five years

this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the decrease of billion or in compared to is primarily due to a significant decrease in natural gas prices and the sale of canadian operations  partially offset by increases associated with the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions 
see supplemental information under item of this form k 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
gathering  processing and marketing strategies overview anadarko supports and seeks to enhance the value of its oil and gas operations through its gpm activities 
these activities provide for the gathering  processing  transportation and ultimate sale of the company s production 
in addition  the gpm function provides services for third party customers 
gathering and processing anadarko invests in gathering and processing facilities midstream to complement its oil and gas operations in regions where the company has significant production 
the company is better able to manage both the value received for  and cost of  gathering  treating and processing natural gas through its ownership and operation of these facilities 
in addition  anadarko s midstream business provides gathering  treating and processing services for third party customers  including major and independent producers 
anadarko generates revenues in its gathering and processing activities through various fee structures that include fixed rate  percent of proceeds  or keep whole agreements 
the company also processes gas at various third party plants 
in  anadarko significantly increased the size and scope of its midstream business through the acquisitions of western and kerr mcgee 
with these acquisitions  anadarko has systems in eight states wyoming  colorado  utah  new mexico  kansas  oklahoma  texas and louisiana located in major producing basins of the onshore united states 
marketing the company s marketing department manages sales of its natural gas  crude oil and ngls 
in marketing its production  the company attempts to maximize realized prices while managing credit exposure 
the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
in  the company also engaged in sales of greenhouse gas emission reduction credits ercs derived from co 

injection operations in wyoming 
the company expects additional sales of ercs in the future 
the company also purchases natural gas  crude oil and ngls volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow the company to aggregate larger volumes  fully utilize transportation capacity  attract larger  more creditworthy customers and facilitate its efforts to maximize prices received for the company s production 
the company may also engage in trading activities for the purpose of generating profits from exposure to changes in market prices of gas  oil  condensate and ngls 
the company does not engage in market making practices and limits its trading activities to oil  gas and ngl commodity contracts 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
see energy price risk under item a of this form k 
in an effort to protect the company from commodity price risk stemming from the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western  the company has derivatives in place covering and of the acquired companies expected volumes on a boe basis for and  respectively

natural gas natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of north america s energy needs and the company believes the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue 
while natural gas prices have fallen over the last year  price volatility persists due to a relatively tight supply and demand balance 
anadarko markets its natural gas production to maximize the commodity value and reduce the inherent risks of the physical commodity markets 
anadarko energy services company aesc  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko  is a marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
the company owns a significant amount of natural gas firm transportation capacity which is used to ensure access to downstream markets and provides the opportunity to capture incremental value when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
the company also stores some of its purchased natural gas in contracted storage facilities with the intent of selling the gas at a higher price in the future 
normally  the company has forward contracts in place physical delivery or financial derivative instruments to sell the stored gas at a fixed price 
in and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke energy corporation duke 
these sales represent and of total revenues related to continuing operations in and  respectively 
as these contracts expired  the company integrated the marketing of the natural gas previously sold to duke into its marketing operations and sells it to various purchasers at market prices 
at the end of  there were no volumes remaining under the original long term contract with duke

cash flow from operating activities anadarko s cash flow from continuing operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the increase in cash flow was attributed to the impact of the acquisitions and higher commodity prices  partially offset by higher costs and expenses and slightly lower legacy sales volumes 
the increase in cash flow compared to was attributed to higher net realized commodity prices  partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the divestitures 
excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for the company s short term changes in cash flow from operating activities 
anadarko holds derivative instruments to help manage commodity price risk 
sales volume changes can also impact cash flow in the short term  but have not been as volatile as commodity prices in prior years 
anadarko s long term cash flow from operating activities is dependent on commodity prices  reserve replacement  the level of costs and expenses required for continued operations and the level of acquisition and divestiture activity

during and  anadarko purchased million and million shares of common stock for billion and billion  respectively  under these programs 
the repurchase program does not obligate anadarko to acquire any specific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time

anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in the amount of future dividends for anadarko common stock will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the covenants in the company s credit agreement provide for a maximum capitalization ratio of debt  exclusive of the effect of any noncash writedowns  until september  after september   the maximum capitalization ratio is debt 
as of december   anadarko s capitalization ratio was 
the company amended the credit agreement prior to closing the acquisitions to allow for a higher maximum capitalization ratio covenant to allow the company to pay dividends consistent with past practices 
although the covenants of the agreement do not specifically restrict the payment of dividends  the company could be limited in the amount of dividends it could pay in order to stay below the maximum capitalization ratio 
based on these covenants  retained earnings of approximately billion were not limited as to the payment of dividends

outlook the company s goals include continuing to find or acquire high margin oil and gas reserves at competitive prices while keeping operating costs at efficient levels 
anadarko completed the acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western in august in two separate all cash transactions 
these transactions required billion of capital which was funded through a day acquisition facility that matures in august the company announced its intention to repay the borrowings under the acquisition facility with proceeds from asset sales  free cash flow from operations and the potential issuances of equity  debt and bank financing 
anadarko intends to reduce leverage significantly during in  the company repaid approximately billion of borrowings with the proceeds received from the sale of the former kerr mcgee gulf of mexico shelf properties 
in addition  the company issued billion of senior notes in the public market in and also received million from a private offering of senior notes in  with proceeds from both debt issuances applied to the repayment of the acquisition facility 
the company also closed the sale of its wholly owned subsidiary  anadarko canada corporation  for approximately billion pretax and further reduced the borrowings under the facility with after tax proceeds 
as of december   anadarko had an aggregate principal amount of approximately billion outstanding under the acquisition facility  which matures in august anadarko has signed several additional separate and unrelated agreements with various companies for the divestiture of certain non core properties in the gulf of mexico and onshore in the united states for a combined total of approximately billion before income taxes

index to financial statements expected incremental after tax proceeds totaling between billion and billion 
the proceeds from all of these transactions are being used to reduce indebtedness 
after the sales are complete  the company expects proved reserves of the new anadarko will be about billion boe  only slightly higher than at the beginning of the goal of the kerr mcgee and western acquisitions was to provide for a more economically efficient platform with higher and more consistent growth potential 
the new portfolio is expected to be better balanced  with lower risk us onshore resource plays that help smooth out the volatility inherent in its deepwater gulf of mexico and international programs 
the company believes the acquisitions and subsequent portfolio restructuring will have the following key benefits a lower risk  more efficient portfolio of core producing properties  a large and high quality portfolio  which should result in more consistent and predictable reserve and production performance  an expanded leasehold position  which provides access to exploration opportunities worldwide  a substantial inventory of identified prospects  which will help deliver value from the exploratory drilling program over many years to come  and expanded technical capabilities  combining the exploration  development  project management and operational skill sets of all three companies 
the company currently expects capital spending to be approximately billion 
the company has allocated about capital spending to development activities  to exploration activities  to gas gathering and processing activities and the remaining for capitalized interest  overhead and other items 
the company s capital discipline strategy is to set capital activity at levels that are self funding 
anadarko believes that its expected level of cash flow  and continued adherence to its capital discipline strategy  will be sufficient to fund the company s projected operational program for if capital expenditures exceed operating cash flow  funds are supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper  money market loans or credit agreement borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place a million committed credit agreement  which is supplemented by various noncommitted credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
as of december   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility 
it is the company s policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully supported by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may sell securities off its shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowings  to secure funds when needed

other developments algeria anadarko s operations in algeria have been governed by an agreement for exploration and exploitation of liquid hydrocarbons psc that anadarko algeria corporation entered into in october with sonatrach  the national oil company of algeria 
in march  anadarko received from sonatrach a letter purporting to give notice under the psc that enactment of law relating to hydrocarbons triggered sonatrach s right under the psc to renegotiate the psc in order to re establish the equilibrium of anadarko s and sonatrach s interests 
anadarko and sonatrach reached an impasse over whether sonatrach has a right to renegotiate the psc based on this new law and have entered into a formal non binding conciliation process under the terms of the psc to try to resolve this dispute 
at this time  anadarko is unable to reasonably estimate what the economic impact under the psc might be if sonatrach is successful in modifying the psc

index to financial statements in july  the algerian parliament approved legislation establishing an exceptional profits tax on foreign companies algerian oil and gas production 
the legislation provides that an exceptional profits tax ranges from to on exceptional profits whenever the monthly price of brent crude averages over per barrel  applied retroactively to production from august  the july legislation did not specify all the aspects necessary to quantify the tax liability  but indicated that regulations clarifying the determination of the tax would be issued in the future 
in december  implementing regulations were issued and sonatrach notified the company as to the applicable regulatory provisions 
the applicable regulatory provisions provide that exceptional profits tax is imposed on gross production at rates of taxation ranging from to based on average daily production volumes for each calendar month 
uncertainty exists as to whether the exceptional profits tax will apply to the full value of production or only to the value of production in excess of per barrel 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a million liability for exceptional profits tax  with associated expense reflected in other taxes in the consolidated statement of income 
this amount represents the company s estimate of its liability for exceptional profits tax from the law s august  effective date through year end  based on the assumption that the tax applies only to production value in excess of per barrel 
if the exceptional profits tax is applied to the full value of production  the company s estimated liability for exceptional profits tax would be million 
the company is not yet in a position to confirm the probable interpretation of the law  but is continuing to monitor further guidance to determine the law s ultimate application to the company 
for  assuming an average oil price of per barrel and application of the exceptional profits tax to production value in excess of per barrel  anadarko s estimated annual production tax expense for the exceptional profits tax would be million 
if the exceptional profits tax is applied to the full value of production rather than to the value in excess of per barrel  the estimated annual expense would double 
sonatrach has notified the company that it will begin collecting current and past exceptional profits tax in march  by retaining of the barrels to which anadarko is entitled until the company s current and prior period liability for exceptional profits tax has been satisfied 
anadarko currently has million barrels of proved undeveloped reserves in algeria  the economics of which are sensitive to the exceptional profits tax 
anadarko is reviewing whether these reserves remain economic under existing development plans if the exceptional profits tax is applied to the entire production value 
assuming that the exceptional profits tax applies to the full value of production and this million barrels of existing proved undeveloped algerian reserves would then become uneconomic  based on the company s analysis  no full cost ceiling test impairment would have been required at december  in response to the algerian government s imposition of the exceptional profits tax  the company has notified sonatrach of its disagreement with the proposed collection of the exceptional profits tax 
the company believes that the psc provides fiscal stability through several of its provisions 
at this time  the company cannot determine the ultimate outcome of any possible negotiations or any potential recourse to conciliation or arbitration by either side 
venezuela anadarko s operations in venezuela have been governed by an operating service agreement osa that was entered into in november with an affiliate of petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa  the national oil company of venezuela 
anadarko and its partner in the osa  petrobras energia venezuela petrobras  have conducted their osa operations through a venezuelan joint venture in which petrobras acted as operator

during and  anadarko entered into various agreements to secure the necessary drilling rigs to execute its drilling strategy over several years 
a review of the company s worldwide deepwater drilling inventory  along with the tightening deepwater and onshore rig market  led anadarko to secure the drilling rigs it needs to execute its strategy 
nearly two thirds of the proposed contracted rig time is intended to delineate and develop discoveries  with the remainder for high potential exploration 
the company believes these rig contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate its drilling strategy 
lease payments for these drilling rig commitments  net of amounts billed to partners  will be capitalized as a component of oil and gas properties

index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates financial statements and use of estimates in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to determination of proved reserves  litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and fair values 
in  significant estimates were also involved in accounting for business combinations 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
in connection with anadarko s august acquisitions of kerr mcgee and western  the company recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the company s fair value estimates for the acquisitions are subject to change as additional information becomes available and is assessed by anadarko 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
anadarko uses all available information to make these fair value determinations  including information commonly considered by the company s engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill the company is required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more often as circumstances warrant 
the first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then no impairment loss is required 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment test  with no impairment indicated 
although anadarko cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired in the future  impairment charges may occur if we are unable to replace the value of our depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the associated reporting unit 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule a i  ii  iii  and  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
the company s estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates are reviewed annually and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits sooner 
a material change in the estimated volumes of reserves could have an impact on the dd a rate calculation and the financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements properties and equipment the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs of unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
management is currently assessing the potential effects of converting from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
should the company decide to change accounting methods  financial statements for prior periods will be restated to reflect the results and balances that would have been reported had it been following the successful efforts method of accounting 
asset retirement obligation the initial estimated retirement obligation of properties is recognized as a liability  with an associated increase in properties and equipment 
accretion expense is recognized over the estimated productive life of the related assets 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment is recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
revisions in estimated liabilities can result from revisions of estimated inflation rates  escalating retirement costs and changes in the estimated timing of settling asset retirement obligations 
costs excluded properties and equipment include costs that are excluded from costs being depreciated or amortized 
oil and gas costs excluded represent investments in unproved properties and major development projects in which the company owns a direct interest 
these unproved property costs include nonproducing leasehold  geological and geophysical costs associated with leasehold or drilling interests and exploration drilling costs 
anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed at least quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the capitalized costs being amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
impairments transferred to the dd a pool increase the dd a rate for that country 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
significant properties are individually evaluated by the company s exploration and engineering staff 
nonproducing leases and geological and geophysical costs are transferred to the dd a pool based on the progress of the company s exploration program 
exploration drilling costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties  which is generally based on drilling results 
the company has a to year exploration and evaluation program for the land grant acreage 
costs are transferred to the dd a pool as they are evaluated 
the land grant s mineral interests both working and royalty interests are owned by the company in perpetuity 
insignificant properties are aggregated and nonproducing leases  along with related geological and geophysical costs  are transferred to the dd a pool over a three to five year period based on the lease term 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon the determination of whether proved reserves can be assigned to the properties 
other costs excluded from depreciation represent major construction projects that are in progress 
derivative instruments current accounting rules require that all derivative instruments  other than those that meet specific exclusions  be recorded at fair value 
quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if quotations are not available  management s best estimate of fair value is based on the quoted market price of derivatives with similar characteristics or on valuation techniques 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company s derivative instruments are either exchange traded or transacted in an over the counter market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option fair values are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against the applicable counterparty s fair values 
derivative accounting rules require that fair value changes of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting be reported in current period earnings  rather than in the period the derivatives are settled and or the hedged transaction is settled 
this can result in significant earnings volatility 
through the end of  anadarko applied hedge accounting to some of its commodity derivatives 
derivative accounting rules are complex  subject to interpretation in their application and interpretative guidance continues to evolve 
as a result of this accounting risk  effective january   anadarko discontinued hedge accounting on all existing commodity and interest rate derivatives 
such a change will not affect anadarko s reported financial position or cash flows and will not require adjustments to previously reported financial statements 
benefit plan obligations the company has defined benefit pension plans and supplemental pension plans that are noncontributory and a foreign contributory defined benefit pension plan 
the company also provides certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees 
determination of the projected benefit obligations for the company s defined benefit pension and postretirement plans is important to the recorded amounts for such obligations on the balance sheet and to the amount of benefit expense in the income statement 
this also impacts the company s decisions for amounts contributed into the plans 
accounting for pension and other postretirement benefit obligations involves numerous assumptions  the most significant of which relate to discount rate for measuring the present value of future plan obligations  expected long term rates of return on plan assets  rate of future increases in compensation levels  and health care cost projections 
anadarko develops demographics and utilizes the work of third party actuaries to assist in the measurement of these obligations 
discount rate the discount rate assumption used by the company is meant to reflect the interest rate at which the pension and other postretirement obligations could effectively be settled on the measurement date 
the company currently uses a yield curve analysis  for a majority of the plans  to support the discount rate assumption 
this analysis involves the creation of a hypothetical aa spot yield curve represented by a series of high quality  non callable  marketable bonds  then discounts the projected cash flows from each plan at interest rates on the created curve specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present values of the cash flows are then accumulated  and a weighted average discount rate is calculated by imputing the single discount rate that equates to the total present value of the cash flows 
the consolidated discount rate assumption is determined by evaluation of the weighted average discount rates determined for each of the company s significant pension and postretirement plans 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used by the company as of december  was 
expected long term rate of return the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption was determined using the year end pension investment balances by category and projected target asset allocations for the expected return for each of these categories was determined by using capital market projections provided by the company s external pension consultants  with consideration of actual five year performance statistics for investments in place 
the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption used by the company as of december  was 
rate of compensation increases the company determines this assumption based on its long term plans for compensation increases specific to employee groups covered and expected economic conditions 
the assumed rate of salary increases includes the effects of merit increases  promotions and general inflation 
the weighted average rate of increase in long term compensation levels assumption used by the company as of december  was 
health care cost trend rate the health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
for year end measurement purposes  the company used separate assumptions of cost increase rates for medical  prescription drugs and dental benefits 
table of contents
