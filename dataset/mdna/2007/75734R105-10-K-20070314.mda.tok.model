item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the item selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto beginning on page f  and the other information appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are the largest manufacturer and distributor of packaged ice in the united states and currently serve approximately  customer locations in states and the district of columbia 
we operate in two business segments ice products and non ice products and operations 
ice products accounted for approximately  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
our ice products business segment consists of the traditional manufacture and delivery of ice from a central point of production to the point of sale  and the installation and operation of the ice factory  our proprietary equipment located in our customers high volume locations that produces  packages and stores ice through an automated  self contained system 
our other business segment  non ice products and operations  consists of refrigerated warehousing for third parties and the manufacture and sale of bottled water 
seasonality 
our results of operations are highly seasonal  characterized by peak demand during the warmer months of may through september  with an extended peak selling season in the southern united states 
as a result of this seasonality and the fixed costs in our business  the proportion of revenues earned in our ice and non ice business segments and the ratio of costs to revenues in any given quarter are not necessarily indicative of the ratios for a full year 
revenues within specific markets can also be affected by weather conditions  with cool or rainy weather negatively impacting demand and extremely hot weather increasing our costs as we respond to excess customer demand for our products 
approximately  and of our revenues occurred during the second and third calendar quarters in  and  respectively 
as a result of seasonal revenue declines and a less than proportional decline in certain expenses during the first and fourth calendar quarters  we typically experience lower profit margins resulting in losses during these periods 
in addition  because a significant portion of our annual sales are generated during the second and third calendar quarters  our annual results of operations may fluctuate significantly if the weather during these periods is cool or rainy 
cool and rainy weather has a negative impact on operations  while warm and dry weather generally has a positive impact 
for additional information concerning the impact of seasonality on our results of operations  see general economic trends and seasonality 
revenues 
our revenues primarily represent sales of packaged ice  packaged ice bags for use in our ice factory equipment  bottled water and cold storage services 
there is no right of return with respect to these products or services 
a portion of our revenues also represents fees earned under management agreements for ice factories located outside our primary territories that are recognized as earnings under contract terms

depreciation expense related to cost of sales and depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are divided into two line items depreciation expense related to cost of sales and depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense related to cost of sales consists of depreciation expense for our production and distribution equipment

operating expenses 
our operating expenses are costs associated with selling  general and administrative functions

we generate cash from the sale of packaged ice through traditional delivery methods  by which we manufacture  package and store ice at a central facility and transport it to our customers retail locations when needed  and through ice factories  which manufacture  package and store ice in our customers retail locations 
our primary uses of cash are a cost of sales  b operating expenses  c debt service  d dividends on our common stock  e capital expenditures related to replacing and modernizing the capital equipment in our traditional ice plants and acquiring and installing additional ice factories and f acquisitions 
historically  we have financed our capital and working capital requirements  including our acquisitions  through a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and operating leases 
our ability to generate cash from our operations is subject to weather  general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in amounts sufficient to enable us to service our debt and to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we do not have sufficient liquidity  we will have to take actions such as reducing or delaying the payment of dividends to our common stockholders  strategic acquisitions  investments and joint ventures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing our debt or seeking additional equity capital 
we cannot assure you that any of these remedies could  if necessary  be effected on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt instruments  including the terms of the credit agreement governing our credit facilities and the reddy holdings indenture  may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives

at december   we had approximately million of total debt outstanding as follows million of reddy holdings senior discount notes due net of unamortized discount of million  million of outstanding term loans under our credit facilities which mature on august   and million of other debt 
senior discount notes 
on october   reddy ice holdings  inc issued million in aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due in a private placement offering pursuant to an exemption from registration under the securities act of the senior discount notes were sold at of the stated principal amount  which resulted in gross proceeds of million 
we used the net proceeds of the offering  together with a dividend of approximately million from our subsidiary to redeem all of our existing series a preferred stock for approximately million  to pay accumulated dividends on such stock as of the date of redemption in the amount of approximately million and to pay a dividend of approximately million to our common stockholders 
in connection with these transactions  our subsidiary made a special transaction payment of approximately million in the aggregate to certain members of management and certain directors 
in connection with the offering of notes and the related transactions  we amended our credit agreement see credit facilities below 
each senior discount note had an initial accreted value of per  principal amount at maturity 
the accreted value of each senior discount note increases from the date of issuance until november  at a rate of per annum such that the accreted value will equal the stated principal amount at maturity on november  thereafter  cash interest will accrue and be payable semi annually at a rate of per annum 
the senior discount notes are unsecured obligations of reddy holdings and are not guaranteed by any of reddy holdings subsidiaries  senior in right of payment to all of reddy holdings future subordinated indebtedness  equal in right of payment with any of reddy holdings existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  effectively subordinated to reddy holdings existing and future secured debt  including debt under our credit facilities that is guaranteed by reddy holdings structurally subordinated to all obligations and preferred equity of reddy holdings subsidiaries

from and after november   we may redeem any or all of the senior discount notes by paying a redemption premium which is initially of the principal amount at maturity of the notes  and will decline annually to zero commencing on november  if a change of control occurs on or prior to november   we may  at our option  redeem all  but not less than all  of the senior discount notes at a redemption price equal to the sum of i the accreted value of the notes as of the redemption date  ii a premium equal to of one year s coupon payment and iii any accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption 
if we experience a change of control and do not elect to make the optional redemption described in the previous sentence  we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior discount notes at a price equal to of their accreted value  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
we may also be required to make an offer to purchase the senior discount notes with proceeds of asset sales that are not reinvested in our business or used to repay other indebtedness 
we registered the senior discount notes with the sec pursuant to a registration statement that was declared effective on august  prior to that date  we accrued additional interest pursuant to a registration rights agreement entered into at the time the senior discount notes were issued 
see note to our audited financial statements included under item for additional information 
the indenture governing our senior discount notes restricts the amount of dividends  distributions and other restricted payments we may pay 
under the indenture  we are restricted from paying dividends on our common stock unless  at the time of such payment no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing or would occur as a consequence thereof  the consolidated coverage ratio set forth in the indenture governing our senior discount notes exceeds to  and there is sufficient capacity under the buildup amount under the indenture governing our senior discount notes 
the consolidated coverage ratio under the indenture governing our senior discount notes means the ratio of our ebitda for the most recent four fiscal quarters to our consolidated interest expense for such four quarter period 
ebitda under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as the sum of our consolidated net income plus our income tax expense  our interest expense  our depreciation and amortization expense  unrealized non cash gains or losses or non cash charges in respect of hedging obligations required to be taken under generally accepted accounting principles  unrealized foreign currency translation gains or losses and all other non cash charges  except to the extent representing an accrual or reserve for a future cash expenditure 
consolidated net income under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as net income of reddy holdings and its restricted subsidiaries plus or minus cash dividends received on investments or equity in net losses of persons other than restricted subsidiaries  respectively  provided that the following are not included in consolidated net income i net income or loss of subsidiaries acquired in pooling of interests transactions for any period prior to the date of their acquisition  ii any net income of a subsidiary restricted in the payment of a dividend other than certain permitted restrictions  including those under our existing credit facilities and our new credit facilities  iii gains or losses from non ordinary course asset sales  iv extraordinary gains or losses  v the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  vi non recurring fees and expenses and write offs of deferred financing costs related to the financing transactions in connection with the merger of cube acquisition corp 
and packaged ice and  vii any fees  charges  costs or expenses relating to our initial public offering and the related transactions and paid in cash  to the extent deducted in the determination of consolidated net income 
consolidated interest expense under the indenture governing our senior discount notes is defined as total interest expense plus  to the extent not included in total interest expense  i interest expense attributable to capital leases  ii amortization of debt discount and issuance costs  iii capitalized interest  iv non cash interest expense  v fees on letters of credit  vi net payments pursuant to hedging obligations  vii dividends accrued on certain disqualified stock viii interest incurred in connection with investments in discontinued operations  ix interest on guaranteed indebtedness and x cash contributions to employee stock ownership plans to the extent they are used to pay interest or fees on indebtedness incurred by such plans 
we are generally required to calculate our consolidated coverage ratio on a pro forma basis to give effect to incurrences and repayments of indebtedness as well as acquisitions and dispositions 
the buildup amount equals of our consolidated net income accrued during the period treated as one accounting period from july  to the end of the most recent fiscal quarter for which internal financial statements are available or  if such consolidated net income is a deficit  minus of such deficit  plus  the net cash proceeds of the issuance of capital stock  subject to certain exceptions  and any cash capital contribution received by us from our stockholders in each case after august  plus the amount by which our indebtedness is reduced on our balance sheet as a result of the conversion or exchange of such indebtedness for our capital stock  plus the net reduction in certain restricted investments made by us  less the amount of certain restricted payments we make from time to time  including  among other things  the payment of cash dividends 
in addition  regardless of whether we could make any restricted payments under the buildup amount provision referred to above  we may make dividend payments at any time in an aggregate amount of up to million if no default has occurred and is continuing under the indenture and following our initial public offering  pay dividends on our capital stock of up to per year of the cash proceeds net of underwriters fees  discounts  commissions or other expenses paid by us received by us from all such public equity offerings subject to specified conditions 
accordingly  we are able to pay approximately million annually in dividends under this provision 
however  the amount of dividend payments permitted under this provision will correspondingly reduce the amount we would otherwise have available to us under the buildup amount for restricted payments  including dividends 
at december   reddy holdings had million of cash on hand that was not subject to any restrictions under our credit facilities and its subsidiary had million of cash on hand that was available for the payment of dividends based on the requirements of our credit facilities discussed below

proceeds of the term loan were used to repay our prior senior credit facility as previously discussed 
on january   reddy group merged with its wholly owned subsidiary  reddy ice corporation  with reddy corp 
being the surviving entity 
the credit facilities were amended on that date to allow the merger and to provide for the assumption of the credit facilities by reddy corp 
at december   we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility  net of outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
the standby letters of credit are used primarily to secure certain insurance obligations 
as of march   the outstanding balances of standby letters of credit were million 
at this time  we do not anticipate any significant changes in our standby letters of credit until the second quarter of  at which time collateral will be required for our policy renewals 
however  later in  this additional new collateral will be offset by reductions in collateral related to earlier policy years 
principal balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest per annum  at our option  at the sum of the base rate plus or libor plus 
the base rate is defined as the greater of the prime rate as announced from time to time by the administrative agent or the federal funds rate plus 
at december   the weighted average interest rate of borrowings outstanding under the credit facilities was 
interest on base rate loans is payable on the last day of each quarter 
interest on libor loans is payable upon maturity of the libor loan or on the last day of the quarter if the libor loan exceeds days 
reddy corp 
pays a quarterly fee on the average availability under our existing revolving credit facility based on an annual rate of except as described below 
the terms of the credit facilities prohibit reddy corp 
from paying dividends and otherwise transferring assets to reddy holdings  except for certain limited dividends  the proceeds of which must be used to maintain reddy holdings corporate existence 
in addition  our credit facilities will allow us to incur up to an additional million of incremental term loans under our credit facilities  subject to certain conditions

all acquisitions included herein were consummated on or before december  interest rate hedging agreement 
effective september   we entered into an interest rate hedging agreement the hedge to fix the interest rate on a portion of our term loan facility 
the hedge has a term of three years and ten months and an initial notional balance of million 
the notional balance decreases by million on october of each of the following three years  beginning on october  we pay a fixed rate of on the notional balance outstanding and receives an amount equal to month libor 
any net payable or receivable amount is settled quarterly 
if we had been required to settle the hedge as of december   it would have received million 
the fair value of the hedge is included in the caption other assets in the consolidated balance sheet 
changes in the fair value of the hedge are recorded as other comprehensive income in the consolidated statement of stockholders equity 
we are exposed to risk of loss in the event of non performance by the counterparty to the hedge  however  we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparty 
liquidity outlook 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  we record the majority of our revenues and profits during the months of may through september 
the majority of the cash generated from those operations is received between july and november 
we have used the excess cash generated from our selling season to fund our operations during the winter months  as well as capital expenditures  acquisitions and dividends to our common stockholders 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million to million  which will primarily be used to maintain and expand our traditional ice operations 
there can be no assurance that our capital expenditures will not exceed this estimate 
in the normal course of our business  we dispose of obsolete  worn out and unneeded assets 
as a result of dispositions of excess assets  we estimate that we will generate proceeds of approximately million to million in for net capital expenditures of approximately million to million 
based on our expected level of operations  we believe that cash flows from operations  together with available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
as of march   we had approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility  which reflected an outstanding balance of million under our revolving credit facility and standby letters of credit of million 
through march   we have completed five acquisitions with an aggregate acquisition cost of approximately million 
we intend to pursue additional acquisitions throughout the remainder of  although such future acquisitions are subject to significant uncertainties as to timing  price and availability 
as noted previously  we record the majority of our sales and profits during the months of may through september and the majority of the cash generated from those operations is received in august through november 
during those months in  we expect to repay all amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility in the spring  fund dividends on our common stock  fund current capital expenditures and debt service and build up cash balances 
debt and capital leases 
the table below summarizes the future payments due under our significant contractual obligations as of december  total to to and thereafter in millions long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations includes estimated cash interest to be paid over the remaining terms of the debt 
consists of our obligation to purchase  merchandisers and million of spare parts per year from a certain vendor under a supply agreement that expires may  general economic trends and seasonality our results of operations are generally affected by the economic trends in our market area  but results to date have not been significantly impacted by inflation 
if we experience an extended period of high inflation  which affects multiple expense items  we believe that we will be able to pass on these higher costs to our customers 
the ice business is highly seasonal  with the bulk of demand coming in the warmer spring and summer months 
accordingly  we experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and profitability 
we make a disproportionate amount of our sales in the second and third calendar quarters 
we also typically have net income in these same periods  whereas we typically experience net loss in the first and fourth calendar quarters 
we believe that over two thirds of our revenues will occur during the second and third calendar quarters when the weather conditions are generally warmer and demand is greater  while less than one third of our revenues will occur during the first and fourth calendar quarters when the weather is generally cooler 
this belief is consistent with historical trends 
as a result of seasonal revenue declines and the lack of proportional corresponding expense decreases  we will most likely experience lower profit margins and even losses during the first and fourth calendar quarters 
in addition  because our operating results depend significantly on sales during our peak season  our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of adverse weather during this peak selling period if the weather is unusually cool or rainy on a more national or regional basis 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make the required payments on their accounts 
we have attempted to reserve for these estimated losses based on our past experience with similar accounts receivable and believe our reserves to be adequate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments on their accounts  additional allowances may be required 
long lived assets 
property and equipment is carried at cost and is being depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated lives of to years for buildings and site improvements and to years for plant  equipment and machinery 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred  while capital improvements that extend the useful lives of the underlying assets are capitalized 
we accounted for all of our historical acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and as a result recorded significant amounts of goodwill 
other intangible assets include the following that are amortized over their useful lives intangible assets useful life goodwill indefinite life trade name indefinite life customer relationships straight line method over economic lives of eight to years debt issuance costs effective interest method over the term of the debt impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability of long lived assets and certain other identifiable intangible assets is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset or its disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and other intangible assets that management expects to hold and use are based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is evaluated using a market valuation approach  based on valuations of comparable businesses  multiples of earnings of comparable businesses and discounted cash flows 
goodwill is evaluated at each fiscal year end and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
inherent in the determination of such future cash flows and valuations are certain estimates and judgments  including the interpretation of current economic indicators and market values and assumptions about our strategic plans with regards to our operations 
to the extent additional information arises or our strategies change  it is possible that our conclusions regarding the impairment of goodwill or other long lived assets could change and result in a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we selected the modified prospective method of adoption and therefore began recognizing stock based employee compensation cost related to all employee awards that were outstanding as of january  in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting standards for all transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods and services 
sfas no 
r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions with employees  and carries forward without change prior guidance for share based payments for transactions with non employees 
sfas no 
r eliminates the intrinsic value measurement objective in apb opinion and generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires us to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be issued  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  using the modified prospective method and straight line amortization of compensation cost 
under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after adoption of the standard and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that are outstanding on that date 
through december   we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost related to stock options was reflected in the net income loss available to common stockholders for the year ended december  as all outstanding stock options had an exercise price equal to or greater than the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 exchanges of nonmonetary assets  an amendment to apb opinion no 

the accounting guidance in apb opinion no 
 accounting for nonmonetary transactions  is based on the principle that exchanges of nonmonetary assets should be measured based on the fair value of the assets exchanged 
the guidance in apb no 
 however  included certain exceptions to that principle 
sfas no 
amends apb no 
to eliminate the exception for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets and replaces it with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance 
a nonmonetary exchange has commercial substance if the future cash flows of the entity are expected to change significantly as a result of the exchange

in june   the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin utilizes a two step approach for evaluating tax positions 
the first step  recognition  occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step  measurement  is only addressed if the recognition criteria have been satisfied 
in the measurement process  the tax benefit is measured at the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis  that is more likely than not to be realized upon final settlement 
fin s use of the term more likely than not consistent with how the term is used in sfas no 
ie the likelihood of an occurrence greater than 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas we will adopt fin as of january  as required and are currently evaluating the impact adoption will have on our results of operations and financial position

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   although earlier adoption is permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this standard may have on our results of operations and financial position
