item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
amounts in thousands  except per share data this report contains forward looking statements  which involve risks and uncertainties 
such statements are subject to certain factors  which may cause our plans and results to differ significantly from plans and results discussed in forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled item a risk factors 
overview we are a biotechnology company working to develop and deliver life changing drug therapies for patients with serious and life threatening medical conditions 
we are engaged in the discovery and development of therapeutic products aimed at treating patients with a wide array of severe disease states  including hematologic diseases  cancer  and autoimmune disorders 
since our incorporation in january  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to drug discovery  research  and product and clinical development 
since september  we have formed a number of wholly owned foreign and domestic entities to support commercial and regulatory operations 
in july  we acquired a manufacturing plant in smithfield  rhode island  for the future commercial production of our products 
in september  we filed a biologics license application  or bla  with the us food and drug administration  or fda  and a european marketing authorization application  or maa  in europe  for soliris eculizumab for the treatment of a rare  life threatening blood disorder known as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria  or pnh 
the phase iii clinical development program for soliris eculizumab in pnh is comprised of two phase iii clinical trials  known as triumph and shepherd 
the fda agreed to the design of the protocols for these two trials under the special protocol assessment  or spa  process 
triumph is a placebo controlled efficacy trial and shepherd is an open label  non placebo controlled safety trial with efficacy secondary endpoints 
in january  we reported positive results from triumph  which results were later published in the september issue of the new england journal of medicine 
all pre specified  primary and secondary endpoints in the triumph trial were achieved with statistical significance 
in december  we reported positive results from shepherd 
soliris eculizumab appeared to be safe and well tolerated during the twelve month shepherd trial  and all pre specified primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in the shepherd trial were achieved with statistical significance 
data from triumph and shepherd served as the primary basis for the bla and maa submitted in the united states and europe  respectively 
in november  we received priority review designation for the soliris eculizumab bla from the fda 
priority review status is granted by the fda to products that  if approved  would be a significant improvement over existing therapies 
similarly  in august  we announced that our soliris eculizumab maa was granted accelerated assessment by the european medicines agency  or emea  in europe 
review under the accelerated assessment procedure is provided by the emea for medicinal products of major therapeutic interest and shortens the timeframe for review by that agency 
in november  we also announced that the emea had validated the soliris maa allowing for commencement of the review process 
in addition to our phase iii pnh clinical program  we are conducting the following efforts the embrace expanded access trial  the explore diagnostics trial and a global patient registry for pnh patients 
the embrace trial the paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria early access treatment protocol was initiated in december to provide the investigational agent eculizumab in the united states to 
table of contents pnh patients in accordance with a treatment protocol authorized by the fda 
treatment protocols are designed to make promising investigational agents available for patients with serious or life threatening diseases for which there are no comparable or satisfactory alternative therapies  before general marketing is authorized 
we initiated the explore trial in august to investigate the frequency and clinical characteristics of undiagnosed pnh patients who have been diagnosed with other bone marrow failure diseases such as aplastic anemia and myelodysplasia 
the global pnh patient registry involves the study of the natural history of pnh 
in addition to pnh  we are considering the evaluation of other potential indications for soliris eculizumab as well as other formulations of eculizumab for additional clinical indications  and we are actively pursuing development of other antibody product candidates in early stages of development 
during  we completed a final phase iii trial of another product candidate known as pexelizumab with our partner for this product  procter and gamble pharmaceuticals 
after reviewing results from that trial  we along with procter gamble pharmaceuticals  have determined not to pursue further development of pexelizumab 
to date  we have not received any revenues from the sale of our products 
we have incurred operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur substantial operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with product research and development  pre clinical studies and clinical testing  regulatory activities  manufacturing development  scale up and commercial scale manufacturing  pre commercialization activities  developing a sales and marketing force  and other infrastructure support costs 
we may need to obtain additional financing to cover these costs 
in november  we sold  shares of our common stock in a registered offering at a price to the public of per share resulting in proceeds of approximately  net of underwriting discount  fees and other expenses 
we intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements and do not guarantee the obligations of any other entity 
we do indemnify certain third parties against liabilities they may incur in connection with the manufacturing  development  or sale of our drug candidates 
in january  we sold  principal amount of notes in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
if the holder elects to convert its notes upon the occurrence of a designated event  the holder will be entitled to receive an additional number of shares of common stock on the conversion date 
these additional shares are intended to compensate the holders for the loss of the time value of the conversion option  are set according to a table within the offering document  and are capped in no event will the shares issuable upon conversion of a note exceed per principal amount 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates in our preparation of consolidated financial statements  we use certain estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and disclosures 
our estimates are often based on judgments  probabilities and assumptions that we believe are reasonable  but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
all of these judgments and estimates can materially impact our result of operations 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements marketable securities we invest in marketable debt securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment grade debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity 
unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a component of stockholders equity 
we believe that our conservative investment policy ensures reasonable assurance against impairment of marketable securities held  and also enables us to avoid incurring realized losses that could occur if securities were not held to maturity 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value  with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  method 
our policy is to capitalize inventory costs associated with our products  subsequent to the filing of our biologics license application  or bla  but prior to regulatory approval  when  based on management s judgment  future commercialization is considered probable and the future economic benefit is expected to be realized 
we assess the regulatory approval process and where the particular product stands in relation to that approval process 
our assessment includes any known constraints and impediments to approval  including safety  efficacy and potential labeling restrictions 
we evaluate our anticipated research and development initiatives and constraints relating to the product and the indication for which it will be used 
we consider our manufacturing environment including our supply chain in determining logistical constraints that could possibly hamper approval or commercialization 
we consider the shelf life of the product in relation to the expected timeline for approval and we consider patent related or contract issues that may prevent or cause delay in commercialization 
we also base our judgment on the viability of commercialization  trends in the marketplace and market acceptance criteria 
finally  we consider the reimbursement strategies that may prevail with respect to the product and assess the economic benefit that we are likely to realize 
there is a risk inherent in these judgments  and we would be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to  among other potential factors  a denial or delay of approval by necessary regulatory bodies 
we periodically review our inventories for excess or obsolete inventory and write down obsolete or otherwise unmarketable inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
if the actual realizable value is less than that estimated by us  or if there are any further determinations that inventory will not be marketable based on estimates of demand  additional inventory write downs may be required 
these reserves are determined based on significant estimates 
a substantial amount of our current soliris eculizumab inventory was manufactured early enough in the regulatory process that we determined to expense the full manufacturing cost 
approximately patient years of soliris eculizumab inventory is sellable and fully expensed 
long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include  among others  the following a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in market value of assets 

table of contents if we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will compare the carrying value of the asset group to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the group 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  we will then compare the carrying value of the asset group to its fair value to determine whether an impairment charge is required 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  such amount is recognized as an impairment charge 
goodwill goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price of acquired businesses and the fair value of their net assets  and is not amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill might not be recoverable 
no impairment charge resulted upon the adoption of this standard or as a result of our annual impairment assessment 
the first step of the review is to compare the fair market capitalization of alexion  annually in november  to our net stockholders equity 
if fair market capitalization is greater than net stockholders equity  then no impairment charges are necessary 
the analysis is impacted by the price of the stock on the date of the test 
impairment charges  if any  will be recorded as a component of operating expenses in the period in which the impairment is determined 
prepaid manufacturing costs cash advances paid by us to secure future long term manufacturing production at third party contract manufacturers are recorded as prepaid manufacturing costs 
these costs are recognized over the period of manufacturing production on a unit of production method 
the cash advances are subject to refund if the manufacturing facility is unavailable as scheduled or forfeiture if we terminate the scheduled production 
we evaluate the prepaid manufacturing costs against estimated net realizable value  or nrv 
if estimated nrv were to be negative  all or a portion of the prepaid manufacturing cost may have to be recognized as an expense 
our calculation of nrv involves estimates of expected sales volume  sales price  and market penetration of the product in question 
revenue recognition we record contract research revenues from research and development support payments  license fees and milestone payments under collaborations with third parties  and amounts received from various government grants 
we evaluate all deliverables in our collaborative agreement to determine whether it represents separate units of accounting 
deliverables qualify for separate accounting treatment if they have standalone value to the customer and if there is objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered items 
up front  non refundable license fees received in connection with a collaboration agreement are deferred and amortized into revenue over the life of the agreement or underlying technologies 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones are recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under terms of a contract may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
research and development support revenues are recognized as the related work is performed and expenses are incurred under the terms of the contracts for development activities 
deferred revenue results from cash received or amounts receivable in advance of revenue recognition under research and development contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of costs incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  pre clinical  
table of contents clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  manufacturing development and scale up costs  contract services and other outside contractor costs  research license fees  depreciation and amortization of lab facilities  and lab supplies 
theses costs are expensed when incurred 
we have entered into a collaboration research agreement with p g in which we share costs 
we record these costs as research and development expenses as incurred 
a portion of these costs are reimbursed by our collaborator and are recorded as a reduction of research and development expense 
accrued research and development expenses are comprised of amounts owed to suppliers for research and development work performed on our behalf 
at the end of each period  we evaluate the accrued expense balance related to these activities based upon information received from the supplier and estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives to ensure that the balance is appropriately stated 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  effective august  sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net earnings 
we have elected to utilize the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas r 
under this method  the provisions of sfas r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption  determined under the original provisions of sfas  shall be recognized in the periods after the date of adoption 
due to our net loss position  a windfall tax benefit was not realized during the period 
as of december   there was  of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
the expense is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to august   we accounted for stock options and restricted stock utilizing the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  recognize no compensation expense for the options when the option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant 
our estimates of employee stock option values rely on estimates of factors we input into the black scholes model 
the key factors involve an estimate of future uncertain events 
significant assumptions include the use of historical volatility to determine the expected stock price volatility 
also  of significance  is our expected term until exercise 
we currently use historical exercise patterns as our best estimate of future exercise patterns 
once employee stock option values are determined  they may not be changed 
we continually seek to refine and improve our assumptions used to measure the value of employee stock options 
foreign currency translation for our foreign subsidiary with a functional currency different from us dollars  we translate its financial statements into us dollars using the current exchange rate at each balance sheet date for assets and liabilities the average exchange rate prevailing during each period for revenues and expenses  and the historical exchange rate for our investments in our foreign subsidiary 
adjustments from translating these financial statements into us dollars are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss

product development costs consist of pre clinical costs  clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs  manufacturing development and manufacturing costs 
the  decrease in research and development expenses resulted primarily from a significant decrease in clinical development and manufacturing expenses costs   and  respectively  related to the termination of the pexelizumab programs 
these decreases in total research and development were partially offset by substantial increases in payroll and benefits costs of  which were primarily impacted by the adoption of sfas r and the resulting expensing of employee stock options grants as well as increased headcount to support our research and drug development activities 
in addition  research and discovery expenses increased by approximately  primarily related to development activities related to our pnh programs 
we anticipate that expenses for research and development will remain at a significant level in as critical and substantive clinical trials near their completion and as we may initiate development of other promising candidates 
during the year ended december   we incurred general and administrative expenses of  which include impairment costs of  compared to the same period in where we incurred general and administrative expenses of  the increase in general and administrative expenses of  from to was due principally to increased pre commercial activities associated with soliris in the us as well as in europe  increased headcount in support of our operations  and  of expenses related to the closure of alexion antibody technologies  inc excluding the effect of the closure of alexion antibody technologies  we expect that general and administrative costs will increase in fiscal as we continue to put in place the commercial organization and infrastructure required to bring soliris to market

table of contents development activities and higher professional fees principally for patent and compliance activities 
the impact on payroll and benefits expenses from the adoption of sfas r was material  but the overall increase in expenses was predominantly driven by our ongoing development of a commercial organization that will ultimately support sales and marketing of product candidates  if approved by regulatory agencies 
total operating expenses were  and  for the five months ended december  and  respectively 
investment income was  for the five months ended december  compared to  for the same period in  reflecting higher market interest rates and a higher principal balance

our research and development costs consist primarily of payroll and benefits costs  pre clinical costs  clinical trial costs and other clinical related development costs  manufacturing development and manufacturing costs  discovery research costs  depreciation and amortization expense  and occupancy related facility operating costs 
the  increase in research and development expenses from to resulted primarily from greater product development costs of  from higher clinical development and higher manufacturing expenses for the cost of conducting our two phase iii clinical trials primo cabg and apex ami in pexelizumab and the increased production of material used in our clinical trials involving soliris and 
table of contents pexelizumab 
the increase in payroll and benefits from to is primarily attributable to the increase in staff involved in clinical and manufacturing development as well as regulatory and quality assurance activities 
the decrease in discovery research is due principally to recognition of the approximately  balance of the non refundable payment received from xoma 
in  xoma paid an upfront non refundable fee of approximately  pursuant to a collaborative agreement 
we recorded the payment as a deferred research and development payment and amortized the payment as a reduction of research and development expense
