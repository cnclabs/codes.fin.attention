item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions  accidents and cargo claims 
most of our insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of months from each policy period inception 
this contractual adjustment factor is used to convert the self insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims 
in the fourth quarter of  we increased the estimated accrual of our ultimate losses by million to reflect the inclusion of these premium factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occurred rather than in the final year of the self insurance period 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
during  we were self insured for  of our claims for personal injury  property damage and workers compensation 
for the two years ended december   we were self insured for million of our claims for personal injury and property damage and million for workers compensation claims 
for  we maintained our  self insured coverage limit 
our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above 
in doing so  the recorded liability considers future claims growth  conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
at december   we had an accrual of approximately million for estimated net claims 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented pre funded claims and premiums 
we are also substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trailers and containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
we have not identified any impairments to our existing assets 
we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade in values for certain new equipment 
we have utilized these trade in values as well as other operational information  such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for depreciation expense 
if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for trade in values  it could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december  and revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments are based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility 
the adequacy of our allowances and reserves is reviewed quarterly 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with current accounting standards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings 
deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared to when they are recognized in our tax returns 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december   as all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax related contingencies on our provision for income taxes 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes based upon changing facts and circumstances 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
see note  income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 
year in review our financial results for calendar year represented the fifth consecutive year of record revenues and earnings 
our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were up over the million  or per diluted share  earned in fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during our fuel cost per gallon averaged above levels 
however  due to our fuel surcharge programs and the support and understanding of our customers  we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 
freight demand during was relatively consistent for our intermodal and dedicated segments 
demand for dry van truck capacity was softer  particularly during the fourth quarter of comparisons of dry van volumes to were negatively impacted by hurricane relief shipments in and lower than expected seasonal demand during august through november of our intermodal and dedicated business units contributed to our higher level of profitability in  while our truck segment experienced an approximate decline in operating income as compared to partly in response to changing market conditions  we increased the size of our intermodal and dedicated tractor fleets by and  respectively  and decreased our dry van fleet by 
we were able to effect some of these changes by merely transferring tractors among our fleets 
we also continued our focus on capacity management during capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight demand on a daily basis and our contractual relationships to determine which business application and segment generates the best returns 
we also continually analyze our business to ensure we are charging a fair price for all services that we provide 
in addition to our capacity management actions  the continuing shortage of quality drivers and changes in the shipper supply chain resulted in the conversion of freight from over the road truck operations to intermodal and dedicated 
our consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was  compared with in the current year was the third consecutive time that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 
our operating income reflected a million pretax charge to increase insurance reserves  and results included a million pretax arbitration charge 
we reinitiated paying a quarterly cash dividend in early and have increased our dividend to in late  in late and to in january we have continued to purchase shares of our outstanding stock through during the current year we purchased million of our common stock and at december   we had million authorized for future purchases 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of percentage change operating revenues between years vs 
vs 
operating revenues operating expenses rents and purchased transportation salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of gains communication and utilities arbitration settlement total operating expenses operating income net interest expense equity in loss of associated company earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in this fsc revenue impacted our year to year comparison 
if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  the increase of revenue over was 
this increased level of revenue  excluding fsc  was primarily a result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions 
a and increase in jbi and dcs load volume  respectively  contributed to our higher levels of revenue 
the increases in revenue of our jbi and dcs segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet and a decline in tractor utilization 
consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over the combination of the increase in revenue over and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our operating ratio improving slightly to from in rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi growth 
the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits increased in over  primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 
fuel and fuel taxes expense was up in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases  partly due to empty miles run and engine idling time  we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our trailing equipment purchases  higher new tractor purchase prices  and an approximate increase in the size of our company owned tractor fleet 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  partly a result of higher tractor maintenance  tires and tolls costs 
a number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects driver recruiting and testing costs  legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding  and charitable contributions in that declined or did not reoccur in also included in the general and administrative expense category  we recognized a million net gain on the disposition of assets in  compared with a million gain in the arbitration settlement expense incurred during was due to the bni arbitration decision discussed in the section on operating segments 
we accrued approximately million of interest expense during related to an irs contingency 
our effective income tax rate was in and we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate for calendar year  but it may be impacted by the adoption of fin we are currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement on our effective tax rate 
see the recent accounting pronouncements section for a discussion of fin the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 
segments we operated three business segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 
operating revenue by segment for years ended december in millions jbi dcs jbt subtotal inter segment eliminations total operating income by segment for years ended december in millions jbi dcs jbt other total jbi operating income reflects a million bni arbitration settlement charge 
operating data by segment for years ended december jbi loads average length of haul miles revenue per load average tractors during the period tractors end of period company owned independent contractor total tractors containers end of period average effective trailing equipment usage dcs loads average length of haul miles revenue per tractor per week average tractors during the period tractors end of period company owned independent contractor customer owned dcs operated total trucks trailers end of period average effective trailing equipment usage jbt loads average length of haul miles loaded miles total miles average non paid empty miles per load revenue per tractor per week average tractors during the period tractors end of period company owned independent contractor total tractors trailers end of period average effective trailing equipment usage includes company owned and independent contractor tractors for jbi and jbt segments  and also includes customer owned tractors for the dcs segment reflects average use of corporate wide trailing equipment using weighted workdays jbi segment jbi segment revenue grew by to billion in  from billion in a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in load volume 
in addition  freight rates increased nearly over the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue 
operating income in our jbi segment rose to million in  from million in the million arbitration settlement charge incurred in september favorably impacted this comparison 
while this settlement also increased rail purchased transportation expense subsequent to october   higher freight rates  increased volumes and reduced use of rail control equipment increased operating income 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in load volume  an approximate increase in rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue 
operating income increased to million in  compared with million in similar to  we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets 
financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during generated appropriate financial returns 
we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue declined to billion in  from billion in this decline was primarily due to a reduction in load volume 
while rates from consistent shippers increased approximately during  a decline in rates from spot and back up pricing and paid empty movements partly offset these increases 
operating income in our jbt segment declined to million in  from million in the decrease was due  in part  to lower levels of tractor utilization and to higher driver compensation and insurance costs 
compared with overview of our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were up over the million  or per diluted share  earned in our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over freight demand during the first half of was not as strong as the comparable period of  but volume levels improved during the last half of our dcs and jbt segments contributed most significantly to our higher level of profitability in while increases in the size of the dcs and jbt tractor fleets accounted for a portion of the increases in operating income  our continued focus on capacity management and revenue per tractor was the primary factor driving improved net earnings 
our net earnings were negatively impacted by the arbitration settlement as previously discussed 
jbi segment jbi segment revenue grew by to billion in  from billion in if fsc revenue were excluded from both years  segment revenue increased over a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc 
in addition  load volume increased over the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix 
operating income in our jbi segment declined to million in  from million in as previously discussed  the million arbitration settlement paid to bni during the third quarter of reduced jbi operating income 
in addition  this settlement also resulted in higher rail purchased transportation expense effective october  these costs more than offset the impact of higher rates and volume in the segment 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew to million in  from million in the increase in fuel surcharge revenue in significantly impacted this comparison 
if we exclude fuel surcharge revenue from both years  dcs segment revenue rose over this increase in revenue resulted from a combination of a increase in the average tractor count and a increase in net revenue per tractor  excluding fsc 
these increases were partly offset by a decline in revenue related to freight delivered by third party carriers 
the majority of these movements were billed by us to the customer in in  a larger portion of these movements was billed directly to our customer by the third party carrier 
operating income rose to million in  compared with million in similar to  we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts  identifying opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets 
financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during generated appropriate financial returns 
we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue was billion in  up over the million in higher fsc revenue in impacted this comparison 
if the amount of fsc revenue were excluded from both years  jbt revenue rose over the average tractor count in was essentially the same as however  revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  was above this higher level of revenue per loaded mile was offset by approximately lower tractor utilization 
current year revenue growth was also up due to additional outsourced freight activity 
operating income of our jbt segment climbed to million in  from million in the significant increase in revenue per loaded mile  excluding fsc  accounted for the majority of this operating income improvement 
consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over the combination of the increase in revenue over and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our operating ratio increasing slightly to from in rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies  related to jbi growth 
the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits increased in over  primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 
fuel and fuel taxes expense was up in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
it is difficult to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was partly a result of higher new tractor purchase prices and an approximate increase in the size of our company owned tractor fleet 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  partly a result of higher trailing equipment maintenance  tires and tolls costs 
a number of states have recently raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls 
the significant increase in general and administrative expenses reflects higher driver recruiting and testing costs  legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding  and charitable contributions 
in october  we announced a million gift to the university of arkansas recorded at its net present value of approximately million 
also included in the general and administrative expense category  we recognized a million net gain on the disposition of assets in  compared with a million gain in the arbitration settlement expense incurred during was due to the arbitration decision discussed earlier 
we accrued approximately million of interest expense during related to an irs contingency 
our effective income tax rate was in and in income tax expense in included a contingent tax liability of million  including accrued interest  related to the irs s challenge of certain sale and leaseback transactions that closed in the equity in loss of associated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in our continued improvement in net earnings has enhanced net cash from operations 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities relative to  after consideration of adjustments for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  was due to higher earnings  collection of insurance reimbursements and a decrease in our insurance prepaid balance  which is a result of lower insurance premiums 
the increase was partially offset by larger federal income tax refunds due us at december   compared to income taxes payable at december  cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment 
the higher level of cash used in investing activities during was primarily a result of significant increases of trailing equipment purchases to replace older trailing equipment 
at december   we had no revenue equipment on capital leases 
net cash used in financing activities during reflects the purchase of million of our common stock and payment of dividends of nearly million in our net cash used in financing activities decreased over due to an increase in borrowings on long term debt and our credit revolvers 
funds were used primarily for stock purchases and the payment of dividends 
selected balance sheet data as of december working capital ratio current maturities of long term debt millions total debt millions total debt to equity total debt as a percentage of total capital from time to time  our board of directors authorizes the purchase of our common stock 
as previously mentioned  the board  in december  authorized the purchase of up to million of our common stock 
we made no purchases in and commenced purchases of our common stock in january on april   our board authorized the purchase of an additional million of our common stock over the next five years 
we purchased million of our common stock in and million in as of december   we were authorized to spend an additional million to purchase our common stock through liquidity our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal trailing equipment  trucks  tractors and dry van trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have  during the past few years  obtained capital through cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit and most recently issued a term loan to acquire trailers that were previously leased 
we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
we had no capital lease arrangements at december  to date  none of our operating leases contains any guaranteed residual value clauses 
at december   we were authorized to borrow up to a total of million under two different revolving lines of credit 
the first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total amount of million 
this line of credit is unsecured and matures in april the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor  depending upon the specific type of borrowing  plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
our second line of credit is an accounts receivable securitization program through abn amro  nv with a revolving credit facility up to million 
this facility is secured by our accounts receivable and matures on july  the applicable interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing a p commercial paper rate in the market plus a margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
we plan to renew this line of credit upon expiration with a one year term 
during  we utilized a million bridge loan with lasalle bank national association 
this loan was a temporary facility until our accounts receivable securitization was finalized 
an million balance was paid off with the proceeds from the accounts receivable securitization during the third quarter 
this loan has been cancelled and we had no outstanding balance related to this facility at december on september   we purchased approximately million of used  dry van trailers off operating lease agreements 
in connection with the purchase of these trailers  we entered into a term loan and credit agreement the facility arranged by sun trust bank 
this new million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing equipment 
this facility matures on september  and our borrowing costs are based on three month libor plus an applicable margin 
on september   we entered into an interest rate swap that effectively converts the variable rate to a fixed rate of 
we are required to make periodic minimum principal payments 
a million principal payment was due and paid on december   with additional million principal payments due every three months thereafter through june  this facility requires us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with these covenants and financial ratios at december  we believe that our liquid assets  cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock 
as mentioned above  we had significant expenditures related to new trailing equipment for we are currently committed to spend approximately million during for trailers and other revenue equipment 
the actual cash expended will be net of proceeds from sale or trade in allowances on revenue equipment 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities 
as of december   we had approximately  trailers and  containers chassis that were subject to operating leases  and we had approximately million of obligations remaining under these leases 
contractual cash obligations as of december  amounts due by period one year one to four to after total or less three years five years five years operating leases long term debt obligations commitments to acquire revenue equipment facilities total we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately million at december   that expire at various dates in fiscal year  which are related to our self insured retention levels for casualty and workers compensation claims  and our operating lease agreements 
we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third party agreements 
recent accounting pronouncements share based payments we may issue stock options and other stock based awards to our key employees and directors under our management incentive plan the plan 
we currently are granting restricted share units and nonstatutory stock options 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb  as permitted by sfas we did not record any stock based employee compensation expense for options granted under our stock option plan prior to january  we recognize the cost of the restricted share units over the applicable vesting period and as a result recorded approximately million of compensation expense in connection with our restricted share unit issuances in in accordance with sfas and sfas  prior to january   we disclosed our pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes i compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and ii compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the adoption of sfas r is discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and provides guidance on classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  while we continue to analyze and quantify the impact of this interpretation  we estimate a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings of between million and million 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of our total million of long term debt  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   under our revolving lines of credit 
the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor 
our earnings would be affected by changes in these short term interest rates 
risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near term adverse increase in short term interest rates 
at our current level of borrowing  a increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately million 
our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate debt as a result of our interest rate swap and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
