item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information about our revenues from our classes of products 
research and development our research and development activities are primarily directed towards the design of new ics  the development of new software design automation tools for hardware and embedded software  the design of ip cores of logic and the adoption of advanced semiconductor manufacturing processes for ongoing cost reductions  performance and signal integrity improvements and lowering power consumption 
as a result of our research and development efforts  we have introduced a number of new products during the past years including the virtex and virtex series of fpgas  and the spartan fpga series 
additionally  we have made major enhancements to our ip core offerings and introduced new versions of our ise software 
to support embedded processing and dsp design on our platform fpga devices  the platform studio tool suite and system generator for dsp have been further enhanced 
we extended our collaboration with our foundry suppliers in the development of nm and nm complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos manufacturing technology and we are the first company in the pld industry to ship nm devices 
our research and development challenge is to continue to develop new products that create cost effective solutions for customers 
in fiscal  and  our research and development expenses were million  million and million  respectively 
we believe technical leadership and innovation are essential to our future success and we are committed to continuing a significant level of research and development effort 
however  there can be no assurance that any of our research and development efforts will be successful  timely or cost effective 
sales and distribution we sell our products to oems and to electronic components distributors who resell these products to oems or subcontract manufacturers 
we use a dedicated global sales and marketing organization as well as independent sales representatives to generate sales 
in general  we focus our direct demand creation efforts on a limited number of key accounts with independent sales representatives often addressing those customers in defined territories 
distributors create demand within the balance of our customer base 
distributors also provide vendor managed inventory  value added services and logistics for a wide range of our oem customers 
whether xilinx  the independent sales representative  or the distributor identifies the sales opportunity  a local distributor will process and fulfill the majority of all customer orders 
in such situations  distributors are the legal sellers of the products and as such they bear all risks generally related to the sale of commercial goods  such as credit loss  inventory shrinkage and theft  as well as foreign currency fluctuations 
in accordance with our distribution agreements and industry practice  we have granted the distributors the contractual right to return certain amounts of unsold product on a periodic basis and also receive price adjustments for unsold product in the case of a subsequent change in list prices 
revenue recognition on shipments to distributors worldwide is deferred until the products are sold to the distributor s end customer 
avnet  inc avnet distributes the substantial majority of our products worldwide 
no end customer accounted for more than of our net revenues in fiscal  or in july  two of the company s distributors  avnet and the memec group memec  consolidated and merged into one entity  with avnet as the surviving company 
as of march  and april   the combined avnet memec entity accounted for and of the company s total accounts receivable  respectively 
resale of product through this combined entity accounted for of the company s worldwide net revenues in fiscal had this acquisition been completed for all periods presented  resale of product through this combined entity would have accounted for and of the company s worldwide net revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
we also use other regional distributors throughout the world 
from time to time  we may add or terminate distributors in specific geographies  as we deem appropriate given the level of business and their performance 
we believe distributors provide a cost effective means of reaching a broad range of customers while providing efficient logistics services 
since plds are standard products  they do not present many of the inventory risks to distributors posed by custom gate arrays  and they simplify the requirements for distributor technical support
