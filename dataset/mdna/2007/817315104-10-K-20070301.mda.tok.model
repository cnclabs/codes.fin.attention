item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we are a research based pharmaceutical company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing differentiated products that address large and growing markets and unmet medical needs and can be marketed to primary care physicians through our sales force 
we currently manufacture and sell three products  xopenex levalbuterol hcl inhalation solution  a short acting bronchodilator  for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in patients six years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease  xopenex hfa levalbuterol tartrate inhalation aerosol  an hfa mdi  for the treatment or prevention of bronchospasm in adults  adolescents and children four years of age and older with reversible obstructive airway disease  and lunesta eszopiclone for the treatment of insomnia in adults 
in october  we received approval from the fda for our nda for brovana arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution micrograms mcg as a long term  twice daily maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with copd including chronic bronchitis and emphysema 
we expect to commercially introduce brovana in the second quarter of we market and sell xopenex inhalation solution  lunesta and xopenex hfa directly through our sales force  and we expect to sell brovana through our sales force as well 
we have entered into out licensing arrangements with respect to several other compounds 
we expect to commercialize any additional products that we may successfully develop through our sales force  through co promotion agreements and or through out licensing partnerships 
critical near term success factors for us include our ability to continue to increase our lunesta revenues  despite increasing competition  continue to increase our xopenex inhalation solution revenues by maintaining targeted sales and marketing efforts aimed at retail  hospital and home health care market segments  which could be adversely affected by potential restrictions on medicare part b reimbursement or changes in the medicare part b reimbursement amount for xopenex inhalation solution  continue to increase our xopenex hfa revenues  successfully market and sell brovana  a long term  twice daily maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with copd  manage expenses effectively to preserve profitability and positive cash flow from operations  and maintain patent protection for our products  particularly for xopenex inhalation solution for which three andas have been submitted to the fda 
we believe that success in each of these areas should allow us to continue to be profitable in the near term and provide us the ability to repay our outstanding convertible debt of  if not converted  repurchased at the noteholders or our option  or otherwise refinanced earlier  the principal amount of this debt becomes due as follows principal amount of convertible debt maturity date in february  we paid in full  in principal amount of outstanding convertible debentures  which matured on february   plus approximately  in accrued interest 
our long term success depends in part on our ability to successfully develop or acquire and commercialize new product candidates 
our material sources of revenue in were product revenues from lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution and xopenex hfa  and to a lesser extent  royalty revenues received from sales of allegra fexofenadine hcl  clarinex desloratadine and xyzal xusal levocetirizine 
we expect that sales of lunesta and xopenex inhalation solution will represent the majority of our total revenues in we do not have long term sales contracts with our customers and we rely on purchase orders for sales of our products 
reductions  delays or cancellations of orders for lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution or xopenex hfa could adversely affect our operating results 
if sales of lunesta  xopenex inhalation solution  xopenex hfa and brovana do not meet our expectations  we may not have sufficient revenue to achieve our business plan and our business will not be successful 
in  we expect to be profitable for the year on an operating and net income basis 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase as compared to as we incur increasing sales commission and marketing costs related to anticipated product revenue growth 
we expect to continue to invest in marketing programs related to lunesta  and marketing support for the brovana commercial introduction 
we expect research and development expenses to increase as compared to as we continue to invest in research and development activities relating to studies for lunesta  for additional studies for brovana  and for continued development of our sep and sep drug candidates  as well as increased drug discovery efforts 
as part of our business strategy  in  and in the future  we expect to consider and  as appropriate  consummate acquisitions of other technologies  product candidates  approved products  and or businesses 
stock option inquiry related matters stock option review we announced in june  that the sec is conducting an informal inquiry into our stock option grants and stock option granting practices 
a special committee of our outside directors  with the assistance of outside legal counsel and outside accounting specialists  reviewed the stock option grants to our officers  directors and employees from to the present under our various stock option plans in effect during this period 
our finance department also reviewed the stock option grants and stock option practices from to present 
their review resulted in the restatement of our financial statements 
representatives from the us attorneys office have been present at meetings that our outside counsel have had with the sec 
while the us attorneys office has not initiated an investigation  we cannot assure you that it will not 
in october  the irs commenced an audit into our and us federal income tax returns and has requested  among other things  certain information relating to our stock option grants and granting practices 
based on the reviews conducted by the special committee and our finance department  we have determined that the correct measurement dates for certain stock option grants to employees  officers and directors made on approximately occasions during prior periods differed from the recorded dates for such awards primarily due to the following circumstances i stock option grants which specified effective dates that may have preceded the dates of receipt of all necessary signatures or approvals  finalization of lists specifying stock option grants or an employee s first date of employment  and ii stock option awards that were approved with exercise prices lower than fair market value on the effective date of grant 
in addition  we have determined that a the modification of certain stock option grants in connection with an employee s termination of employment and b the exercise of certain stock options that had not vested prior to an employee s termination  resulted in a new measurement date for such stock options 
as a result  we were required to record non cash adjustments for additional stock based compensation expense in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
these non cash charges had no impact on previously reported revenues  cash or cash equivalents or total assets 
members of our senior management have benefited from some of the stock option grants for which we were required to record additional stock based compensation expense 
in addition  our chief executive officer and our executive vice president of finance and administration had varying degrees of involvement in the administration of some of these stock option grants 
the special committee has concluded that there is no evidence of fraud  illegal activity or an intent to mislead or deceive with respect to our stock option granting practices or the specific grants that have resulted in the restatement of our financial statements 
the special committee also determined that the board of directors and or compensation committee generally intended to award the options on the dates specified in the grants  although they were not aware of the accounting consequences 
however  the sec and or any other governmental agency that may initiate a formal investigation may reach different conclusions and  if so  we could be subject to monetary damages  fines and penalties  and our officers and or directors could be prohibited from serving as officers and directors of any public company and could be subject to criminal penalties and disgorgement 
special committee findings and recommendations the special committee has made certain recommendations with respect to remedial actions  all of which the board is adopting and we are implementing 
they include adoption of a stock option policy governing the granting of equity awards to our officers  directors  employees and consultants 
the policy provides that  among other things equity awards may only be approved at board or committee meetings  and not by written action  stock options must be priced at the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market on the date of approval  and annual equity awards to executive officers may only be approved at the compensation committee meeting that coincides with our annual meeting of stockholders 
adoption of standard operating procedure guidelines relating to the administration of our equity awards process 
the guidelines are intended to help ensure we maintain compliance with our stock option plans and policy  relevant accounting principles  sec reporting requirements and irs regulations 
additional training for finance  accounting  human resource and legal personnel  as well as members of the board  in areas associated with the stock option granting and recording processes 
creation of a new position of chief compliance officer  one of whose duties will be to oversee the equity award granting process 
we have initiated a search for candidates for this position 
creation of an internal audit function 
the management changes discussed elsewhere in this form k are not being implemented in connection with the stock option inquiry or at the request or recommendation of the special committee 
notwithstanding the special committee s finding that there was no evidence of fraud  illegal activity or an intent to mislead or deceive  our officers and directors have voluntarily agreed to increase the exercise price of each stock option they hold with an exercise price equal to less than fair market value on the corrected measurement date  as determined in connection with the restatement of our financial statements 
the increased exercise price for each such stock option will be equal to the closing price of our common stock on the applicable measurement date 
the special committee will remain in place for the duration of the sec s inquiry 
should additional information become available to us in connection with the sec inquiry  the special committee may be required to reopen its review and the current determination of stock based compensation could change 
significant and developments on march   we announced that w 
james o shea had resigned as our president and chief operating officer and had been elected as vice chairman 
in addition  we announced that  effective march   our board had elected adrian adams to the positions of president and chief operating officer and andrew i 
koven to the positions of executive vice president  general counsel and secretary 
the board  upon the recommendation of the nominating and corporate governance committee  has also elected mr 
adams to the board of directors  as a class ii director 
we currently expect that mr 
adams will be elected to the position of chief executive officer within six months of march  douglas e 
reedich  senior vice president  legal affairs  plans to leave sepracor but will remain in this position for a period of up to months to ensure an orderly transition in the handling of our legal matters 
in february  we paid in full  in aggregate principal amount of outstanding convertible debentures  which matured on february   plus approximately  in accrued interest 
in october  we announced that the fda  approved brovana arformoterol tartrate inhalation solution mcg as a long term  twice daily morning and evening  maintenance treatment of bronchoconstriction in patients with copd  including chronic bronchitis and emphysema 
brovana is for use by nebulization only 
we expect to commercially introduce brovana during the second quarter of in september  tharos laboratories  inc filed suit against us in the united states district court  district of utah  central division  alleging trademark infringement  dilution  unfair competition  false advertising  and false designation of origin arising out of our use of our silk moth design in connection with lunesta 
tharos seeks unspecified monetary damages and an injunction of our use of the silk moth design 
in october  we filed a motion to dismiss tharos claims 
on february  the court granted our motion in respect of the state unfair competition claims and denied it in respect of tharos other claims 
we are unable to reasonably estimate any possible range of loss related to this lawsuit due to its uncertain resolution 
in august  we received notification that the fda had received an anda  including a paragraph iv certification  from dey  l 
p seeking approval of a generic version of our mg ml levalbuterol hydrochloride inhalation solution concentrate 
we have filed a civil action against dey  l 
p for patent infringement 
if we successfully enforce our patents  the fda will not approve the relevant anda until expiration of the applicable patents 
otherwise  the fda will stay its approval of the relevant anda for months following the date we received notice of such anda or until a court decides that our patents are invalid  unenforceable or not infringed  whichever is earlier 
in june  we announced that the sec is conducting an informal inquiry into our stock option grants and stock option granting practices 
a special committee of our outside directors  with the assistance of outside legal counsel and outside accounting specialists  reviewed the stock option grants to our officers  directors and employees from to the present under our various stock option plans in effect during this period 
our finance department also reviewed the stock option grants and stock option practices from to present

in october  the irs commenced an audit into our and us federal income tax returns and has requested  among other things  certain information relating to our stock option grants and granting practices 
in june  we advanced sep  an snri  into a phase i clinical study for the treatment of depression 
in june  we met with the japanese regulatory authorities  the pmda and received approval to proceed with our plan for clinical development of lunesta in japan 
in late  we filed in japan a clinical trial notification  which is equivalent to an ind in the us  and in january  began a phase i study of lunesta in japan 
in may  we completed a phase i clinical study of a triple reuptake inhibitor  sep  for the treatment of depression 
we are planning to initiate a phase ii clinical study of sep in during the second quarter of  we completed the hiring and training of an additional sales representatives and managers 
this expansion will help to support expected future sales growth of our marketed products 
in april  we were notified of an anda seeking approval of a generic version of our mg  mg and mg levalbuterol hydrochloride inhalation solution including a paragraph iv certification  which was submitted to the fda by watson laboratories  inc watson s paragraph iv certification was limited to our patent that expires in and covers certain levalbuterol hydrochloride inhalation solutions  including xopenex inhalation solution 
we have decided not to file a civil action against watson laboratories  inc for patent infringement at this time 
in march  the dme pscs issued a draft local coverage determination under which medicare reimbursement for xopenex inhalation solution would be reduced to the level of reimbursement for generic albuterol inhalation solution under medicare part b  which is substantially less than the current level of reimbursement for xopenex inhalation solution 
in december  the cms commenced an nca to determine when use of nebulized levalbuterol for treating copd in the medicare population is reasonable and necessary 
we expect the nca process to be concluded before the end of we estimate that approximately to percent of our xopenex inhalation solution units sold are subject to reimbursement under medicare part b 
if this local coverage determination is implemented  or if the nca results in significant restrictions on nebulized levalbuterol  revenue from these sales of xopenex inhalation solution would be materially adversely affected 
in february  we announced that we entered into a licensing agreement with ucb relating to levocetirizine 
under this agreement  we have exclusively licensed to ucb all of our patents and patent applications in the united states regarding levocetirizine and royalties will be payable to us on us sales of levocetirizine products 
in july  ucb announced it had submitted an nda to the fda seeking approval for xyzal 
in september  ucb and sanofi aventis announced they entered into an agreement to co promote xyzal in the united states 
we currently earn royalties from ucb on sales of levocetirizine in european countries where the product is sold 
levocetirizine is currently marketed by ucb under the brand names xyzal and xusal in the eu for treatment of symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis  persistent allergic rhinitis and ciu in adults and children six years of age and older 
in january  we announced that we had completed the second million purchase of acadia common stock in connection with our collaboration with acadia that we entered into in january our purchase was made at a price of approximately per share  which represented a percent premium to the day trailing average closing price on the nasdaq global market as of the one year anniversary of the collaboration  and resulted in the issuance to us of  shares of acadia common stock 
our agreement with acadia includes an option to select a preclinical candidate from acadia s hta program for use in combination with lunesta 
we have decided not to exercise this option 
in january  we announced that we had been notified that the fda had received an anda from dey  lp for a generic version of levalbuterol hydrochloride inhalation solution 
dey s submission includes a paragraph iv certification alleging our patents listed in the orange book for xopenex inhalation solution are invalid  unenforceable or not infringed by dey s proposed product 
we have filed a civil action against dey  lp for patent infringement 
revenue related agreements fexofenadine hcl 
in july  we licensed to hoechst marion roussel  inc  now sanofi aventis formerly aventis  our us patent rights covering fexofenadine hcl 
in october  sanofi aventis commercially introduced allegra  which is fexofenadine hydrochloride 
in  under an amendment to our agreement with sanofi aventis  we assigned to sanofi aventis our us patent relating to fexofenadine and licensed to sanofi aventis certain us patent applications relating to fexofenadine 
under the terms of a separate agreement  sanofi aventis obtained an exclusive license to our fexofenadine patents that had been the subject of litigation in europe  and various other patent oppositions between the two companies outside the united states 
since march   we have been entitled to receive royalties on fexofenadine product sales in countries where we have patents related to fexofenadine 
we have been entitled to receive royalties on any fexofenadine sales in the united states since february however  since the introduction of a generic version of allegra in the united states during the third quarter of  we have ceased to earn royalties on us sales of allegra 
we are currently receiving royalties from sanofi aventis for sales of allegra in japan  canada and australia and in certain eu member states where we hold patents 
we recorded approximately   and  of royalty revenues under these agreements in  and  respectively 
desloratadine 
in december  we licensed to schering plough exclusive worldwide rights to our patents and patent applications relating to desloratadine  an active metabolite of loratadine  which is used as an antihistamine 
schering plough has marketed desloratadine as clarinex since we recorded approximately   and  of royalty revenue under this agreement in  and  respectively 
levocetirizine 
in february  we announced that we entered into a licensing agreement with ucb relating to levocetirizine 
under this agreement  we have exclusively licensed to ucb all of our patents and patent applications in the united states regarding levocetirizine and royalties will be payable to us on us sales of levocetirizine products

levocetirizine is currently marketed by ucb under the brand names xyzal and xusal in the eu for treatment of symptoms of seasonal and perennial allergic rhinitis  persistent allergic rhinitis and ciu in adults and children six years of age and older 
we recorded approximately   and  of royalty revenue under the agreement with ucb in  and  respectively 
eszopiclone 
we entered into an agreement in october with sanofi aventis predecessor  rhone poulenc rorer sa  under which we exclusively licensed preclinical  clinical and post marketing surveillance data package relating to zopiclone  its isomers and metabolites  to develop  make  use and sell eszopiclone in the united states zopiclone is marketed by sanofi aventis in approximately countries worldwide under the brand names of imovane and amoban 
under this agreement with sanofi aventis  sanofi aventis assigned all us patent applications relating to s zopiclone to us 
under the amended agreement  we have the right to read and reference sanofi aventis regulatory filings related to zopiclone outside of the united states for the purpose of development and regulatory registration of eszopiclone outside of the united states  and sanofi aventis has assigned to us the foreign counterparts to the us patent covering eszopiclone and its therapeutic use 
also as part of the amendment  we permitted sanofi aventis to assign our obligation to pay a royalty on sales of lunesta in the united states to a third party 
results of operations year ended december  compared to revenues product sales were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
sales of lunesta were  in  as compared to  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily the result of a increase in the number of units sold  which is principally attributable to twelve months of sales in as compared to nine months of sales in the increase is also related to a increase in net selling price  which resulted from a gross sale price increase of approximately  offset by sales discounts and allowances 
adjustments recorded to gross sales are disclosed below under the heading analysis of gross sales to net sales 
sales of xopenex inhalation solution were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily due to a increase in the number of units sold and a increase in the net selling price per unit  which included a weighted average gross per unit price increase of approximately 
adjustments recorded to gross sales are disclosed below under the heading analysis of gross sales to net sales 
sales of xopenex hfa were  in  as compared to  in  an increase of approximately 
we introduced xopenex hfa commercially in december and our xopenex hfa revenues in relate primarily to initial inventory stocking by the wholesalers 
analysis of gross sales to net sales the following table presents the adjustments deducted from total gross sales to arrive at total net sales for the year ended december  of sales of sales change change dollars in thousands gross sales adjustments to gross sales payment term discounts wholesaler fee for service government rebates and contractual discounts returns other includes product introduction discounts sub total adjustments net sales the increase in adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales in as compared to primarily reflects an increase in government rebates and contractual discounts as a result of an increase in discounts we offered primarily on the sales xopenex hfa  which was commercially introduced in december  an increase in discounts offered to managed care organizations  and an increase in discounts given through medicare and medicaid programs  wholesaler fee for service discounts also increased in as compared to  as these discounts did not commence until the second quarter of offsetting these increases in adjustments to gross sales as a percentage of gross sales were a decrease in government rebates and contractual discounts due to a reversal of reserves relating to rebates under the department of veterans affairs tricare pharmacy benefits program  which was based on a us federal court of appeals ruling in september that pharmaceutical manufacturers are not required to provide reimbursement for drugs purchased through the tricare program  and a decrease in sales returns primarily due to a decrease in actual returns for xopenex inhalation solution and the weighting of lunesta returns which are estimated at a lower rate 
included in the government rebates and contractual discounts is a reserve for medicare part b discounts related to xopenex inhalation solution sales 
medicare reimbursement rates for xopenex inhalation solution have been favorable since january  but we cannot be certain these favorable rates will continue 
in march  the dme pscs issued a draft local coverage determination under which medicare reimbursement for xopenex inhalation solution would be reduced to the level of reimbursement for generic albuterol inhalation solution 
in december  the cms commenced an nca to determine when use of nebulized levalbuterol for treating copd in the medicare population is reasonable and necessary 
we expect the nca process to be concluded before the end of we estimate that approximately to percent of our xopenex inhalation solution units sold are subject to reimbursement under medicare part b 
if this local coverage determination is implemented  or if the nca results in significant restrictions on the use of nebulized levalbuterol  revenue from these sales of xopenex inhalation solution would be materially adversely affected 
royalties were  in as compared with  in  respectively  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease is primarily due to the decrease in royalties earned on the sales of allegra under our agreement with sanofi aventis  which were  in as compared to  in  primarily because we ceased to receive royalties on sales of allegra in the united states beginning in late pursuant to the terms of our us agreement with sanofi aventis  our royalties on the sale of allegra in the united states  which have historically been between and million per year  terminated based on the introduction of a generic equivalent of this product in the united states in september we are still entitled to receive royalties on the sale of allegra outside of the united states in countries where we hold patents covering allegra and no generic equivalent product has been introduced 
royalties earned on sales of clarinex  under our agreement with schering plough increased to  in from  in in august  we were notified that several andas containing paragraph iv certifications had been received by the fda seeking approval of generic versions of certain of schering plough s clarinex products 
if and while a generic version of a clarinex product is marketed in the united states without schering plough s consent  schering plough will have no obligation to pay royalties to us on the us sales of clarinex products 
royalties earned on sales of xyzal xusal  under our agreement with ucb increased slightly to  in as compared to  in costs of revenues cost of products sold was  in as compared with  in  or approximately of gross product sales for both and cost of lunesta sold as a percentage of lunesta gross sales was approximately in and  principally due to royalties we pay to a third party on net sales of lunesta 
cost of xopenex inhalation solution sold as a percentage of xopenex inhalation solution sales was approximately in  as compared with in the decrease in the cost as a percentage of gross sales is primarily due to a gross sales price increase in cost of xopenex hfa sold as a percentage of xopenex hfa gross sales was approximately in compared to in included in the costs of xopenex hfa sold is a royalty paid on net sales of xopenex hfa to m  our third party finished goods manufacturer of the product 
we commercially introduced xopenex hfa in december the increase in the cost as a percentage of gross sales is primarily due to an increase in the cost of materials used in manufacturing 
cost of royalties earned was  for  compared with  in the cost of royalties in both periods relates to an obligation to a third party as a result of royalties we earn from schering plough based on its sales of clarinex 
this increase in obligations to the third party is due to the increase in royalties earned in as compared to research and development research and development expenses were  in as compared to  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily due to our increased spending on two of our early stage projects  sep and sep  the lunesta phase iiib iv projects  and drug discovery efforts 
in addition  we experienced a  increase in non project specific personnel related expense  which includes stock based compensation expense of  in  resulting from our january  implementation of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r share based payment  revised  or sfas r  as compared to in offsetting these increases to research and development expenses  was a reduction to project spending on xopenex hfa and brovana in as compared to in  we intend to significantly increase research and development expenditures over we expect our principal research and development activities will relate to lunesta  brovana  sep  sep  and drug discovery 
drug development and approval in the united states is a multi step process regulated by the fda 
the process begins with the filing of an ind which  if successful  allows the opportunity for study in humans  or clinical study  of the potential new drug 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs in clinical development are in phase iii clinical trials  as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug development process 
following successful completion of phase iii clinical trials  an nda must be submitted to  and accepted by  the fda  and the fda must approve the nda prior to commercialization of the drug 
we may elect either on our own  or at the request of the fda  to conduct further studies that are referred to as phase iiib and iv studies 
phase iiib studies are initiated and either completed or substantially completed while the nda is under fda review 
these studies are conducted under an ind 
phase iv studies  also referred to as post marketing studies  are studies that are initiated and conducted after the fda has approved a product for marketing 
phase iv studies may be requested by the fda either before or after the fda has approved an nda 
these studies may also be independently initiated by the company whose nda has been approved 
the fda uses post marketing studies to gather additional information about a product s safety  efficacy or optimal use 
successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
completion dates and completion costs can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to predict 
the lengthy process of seeking fda approvals  and subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain any approval required by the fda on a timely basis  if at all 
for additional discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential product candidates  see risk factors 
below is a summary of development of our products and product candidates that represent or more of our direct project research and development spending for the year ended december  the estimate of completion of phase column contains forward looking statements regarding expected timing of completion of product development phases 
completion of product development  if successful  culminates in the submission of an nda to the fda  however  there can be no assurance that the fda will accept for filing  or approve  any nda 
the actual timing of completion of phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
in the table below  the three fda approved products and two product candidates listed accounted for approximately of our direct project research and development spending in no other product candidate accounted for more than of our direct research and development spending in product or product candidate indication phase of development estimate of completion of phase lunesta eszopiclone insomnia xopenex hfa levalbuterol tartrate respiratory asthma brovana arformoterol tartrate respiratory copd nda approved sep depression phase i sep depression phase i we commercially introduced lunesta in april  research and development spending in relates to phase iv clinical studies

the fda approved our brovana nda in october we are targeting commercial introduction of brovana in the second quarter of below is a summary of expenditure information related to our products and product candidates representing or more of our direct project research and development spending during the year ended december  and  as well as the costs incurred to date on these projects 
the costs in this analysis include only direct costs and do not include certain indirect labor  overhead  share based compensation or other costs that benefit multiple projects 
as a result  fully loaded research and development cost summaries by project are not presented 
project costs for the year ended december  project costs through december  project costs for the year ended december  project costs through december  in thousands lunesta eszopiclone xopenex hfa levalbuterol tartrate brovana arformoterol tartrate sep sep due to the length of time necessary to develop a product  uncertainties related to the ability to obtain governmental approval for commercialization  and difficulty in estimating costs of projects  it is difficult to make accurate and meaningful estimates of the ultimate cost to bring our product candidates to fda approved status 
we do not believe it is possible to estimate  with any degree of accuracy  the costs of product candidates that are in stages earlier than phase iii 
accordingly  because all of our product candidates are in phase i development  we have not provided any such estimates 
selling  marketing and distribution selling  marketing and distribution expenses were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is primarily related to a  increase in personnel related expense  which included an increase in salaries as a result of hiring additional sales representatives and management to support marketed products and an increase in stock based compensation expense of  in over  as a result of our january  implementation of sfas r  which were offset by a decrease in commission expense as a result of lower commission level achievement in as compared to in addition to the personnel related expense increase  we incurred a  increase in marketing  advertising and promotion costs primarily in support of lunesta 
in  we expect selling  marketing and distribution expenses to increase in support of our anticipated product revenue growth  partly related to marketing and advertising costs associated with the commercial introduction of brovana 
in addition  sales expenses will increase due to the annualized costs associated with our sales force expansion of sales professionals in general and administrative general and administrative costs were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is largely due to a  increase in personnel related costs  which is primarily attributable to a  increase in stock based compensation expense over as a result of our january  implementation of sfas r 
the increase was also partly due to a  increase in legal fees related to patent support and litigation and shareholder lawsuit related costs  as well as expense associated with responding to the sec s informal inquiry into our stock option grants and practices and the related internal investigation 
other income expense interest income was  in as compared to  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is due to higher average balances of cash and short and long term investments combined with an increase in the interest rates earned on investments in our monthly average cash and investment balance was approximately  and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
for and  the average annualized interest rate that we earned on our investments was and  respectively 
interest expense was  in as compared with  in the expense in both periods is primarily related to the interest we paid on our convertible subordinated debentures due  which were paid in full in february in  we expect interest expense to decrease significantly as a result of our repayment of the  debentures in february equity in investee losses were  in as compared with  in the equity in investee loss in and represents our portion of the losses of biosphere medical  inc gain on sale of equity investment was in as compared with  in the gain in represents the gain we recorded when we received cash in exchange for our shares of vicuron pharmaceuticals  inc or vicuron  in connection with the merger of pfizer and vicuron in september income taxes income tax expense was  in as compared to  in income tax expense in includes federal and state alternative minimum tax expense 
income tax expense in includes state tax expense and foreign income tax expense 
fiscal year was the first time we generated income from operations and  therefore we will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until profitability has been sustained over an appropriate time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we determine  based on future profitability  that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate material income tax benefit in the period of decrease and material income tax provisions in future periods 
year ended december  compared to revenues product sales were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately  primarily as a result of the commercial introduction of lunesta in april and a significant increase in xopenex inhalation solution revenue 
sales of lunesta were  in  as compared to in adjustments recorded to gross sales are disclosed below under the heading analysis of gross sales to net sales 
sales of xopenex inhalation solution were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in product sales in as compared with is due primarily to an increase in unit volume sales of xopenex of and also due to a net selling price per unit increase of approximately 
the increase in unit volume sales is due to growth in the underlying unit dose vial  or udv  market and higher market share in the non retail sector  particularly sales to hospitals and home health care customers 
the increase in the net selling price per unit is due to a gross unit price increase of approximately and a decrease in sales rebates and allowances as a percentage of sales 
the decrease in sales rebates and allowances is primarily attributable to favorable reimbursement rate changes  as mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of  which substantially reduced discounts in the home health care market sector 
we cannot be certain whether  or for how long  this favorable reimbursement rate will remain in effect 
adjustments recorded to gross sales are disclosed below under the heading analysis of gross sales to net sales 
sales of xopenex hfa were  in  as compared to in we commercially introduced xopenex hfa in december  and our revenues in relate primarily to initial inventory stocking of the product by wholesalers 
adjustments recorded to gross sales are disclosed below under the heading analysis of gross sales to net sales

all of our product sales in were for xopenex inhalation solution 
the medicare percentage decreased in due to a favorable reimbursement code rate change  as mandated by the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of this change in the reimbursement code rate substantially reduced discounts to the home health care sector and  accordingly  to our medicare liability in as compared to we cannot be certain whether  or for how long  this favorable reimbursement rate will remain in effect 
these decreases in product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales were partially offset by the addition of a wholesaler fee for service arrangements in the second quarter of and by higher returns as a percentage of sales  as the returns in were significantly lower than all other years 
royalties were  in as compared with  in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in as compared with is due primarily to a decrease in royalties earned on sales of clarinex 
the royalties earned on clarinex sales were  in as compared to  in  a decrease of approximately 
offsetting the decrease in royalties earned on sales of clarinex is an increase in royalties earned on sales of xusal xyzal and allegra 
the royalties earned on xusal xyzal sales were  in as compared to  in  an increase of approximately  resulting from increased european sales of xusal xyzal 
the royalties earned on allegra sales were  in as compared to  in  an increase of approximately 
license fees and other revenues were in as compared to  in other revenues in represented co promotion revenue of  received from medpointe for our co promotion of astelin and  of other medpointe related revenue 
we terminated our co promotion agreement with medpointe on october  costs of revenues cost of products sold was  in as compared with  in cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales decreased to in as compared to in  because manufacturing costs for lunesta  which was commercially introduced in  were slightly lower than xopenex inhalation solution as a percentage of their respective product sales 
cost of lunesta sold as a percentage of lunesta gross sales was approximately for  with the largest portion being the royalty paid on net sales of lunesta to a third party 
in accordance with our accounting policies  we did not begin to capitalize product manufacturing costs associated with lunesta as inventory until the fda approved the lunesta nda 
cost of xopenex inhalation solution sold as a percentage of xopenex inhalation solution gross sales was approximately for and cost of xopenex hfa sold as a percentage of xopenex hfa gross sales was approximately for we commercially introduced xopenex hfa in december included in the costs of xopenex hfa sold is a royalty paid on net sales of xopenex hfa to m our third party finished goods manufacturer of the product 
cost of royalties earned was approximately  in as compared with  in the cost of royalties in and relates to an obligation to a third party as a result of royalties we received from schering plough based upon their sales of clarinex 
research and development research and development expenses were  in as compared with  in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in as compared with is primarily due to decreased spending on two of our late stage programs  lunesta and brovana 
our decreased spending on these programs was partially offset by our increased spending on drug discovery efforts largely related to our collaboration with acadia  an increase in payroll and related expenses resulting from an increase in employee headcount and spending related to early stage projects  such as sep and sep below is a summary of development of our product candidates that represented or more of our direct project research and development spending for the year ended december  the estimate of completion of phase column contains forward looking statements regarding expected timing of completion of product development phases 
completion of product development  if successful  culminates in the submission of an nda to the fda 
the actual timing of completion of phases could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
the table is sorted by highest to lowest spending amounts in  and the three product candidates listed accounted for approximately of our direct project research and development spending in no other product candidate accounted for more than of our direct research and development spending in product or product candidate indication phase of development estimate of completion of phase xopenex hfa levalbuterol tartrate respiratory asthma brovana arformoterol tartrate respiratory copd lunesta eszopiclone insomnia we commercially introduced xopenex hfa in december we submitted an nda to the fda in december the fda approved brovana in october we are targeting commercial introduction of brovana in the second quarter of we commercially introduced lunesta in april below is a summary of expenditure information related to our product candidates representing or more of our direct project research and development spending during the year ended december   as well as the costs incurred to date on these projects 
the costs in this analysis include only direct costs and do not include certain indirect labor  overhead or other costs which benefit multiple projects

we do not believe it is possible to estimate  with any degree of accuracy  the costs of product candidates that are in stages earlier than phase iii 
selling  marketing and distribution selling  marketing and distribution expenses were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
of the increase  is primarily due to direct to consumer media and print campaigns for the commercial introduction of lunesta as well as a product sampling program  market research and medical communications initiatives 
expenses also increased due to marketing costs related to the commercial introduction of xopenex hfa  and as a result of increased salaries  commissions and associated fringe benefit costs associated with a sales expansion of approximately sales representatives in these increases were offset by a decrease in sales commission expense paid to the ross products division of abbott laboratories for the co promotion of xopenex inhalation solution 
our co promotion agreement with ross terminated effective december  general and administrative general and administrative costs were  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in as compared with is primarily due to payroll and related expenses resulting from an increase in permanent and temporary employees and contracted service providers supporting the commercialization of lunesta 
the increase is also attributable to increased legal fees related to patent support and litigation  as well as patent write offs relating to several compounds that we are no longer supporting  and an increase in the amortization of deferred financing costs primarily associated with our notes due other income expense interest income was  in as compared with  in  an increase of approximately 
the increase is due to higher average balances of cash and short and long term investments combined with an increase in the interest rates earned on investments in our monthly average cash and investment balance was approximately  and  for and  respectively 
for and  the average annualized interest rate that we earned on our investments was and  respectively 
interest expense was  in as compared with  in the expense in both periods is primarily related to the interest we paid on our convertible subordinated debentures due debt conversion expense was in as compared with  in in  we converted  of our series a notes due and  of our series b notes due the expense represents the cash payments of  and  that we paid to the holders of the series a notes due and series b notes due  respectively  as an inducement to convert their notes 
loss on debt redemption was in as compared with  in in  we redeemed the remaining outstanding  principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due for aggregate cash consideration of  excluding accrued interest 
the loss in represents the write off of  of deferred financing costs related to the convertible subordinated notes due equity in investee losses were  in as compared with  in the equity in investee loss in and represents our portion of the losses of biosphere medical  inc  referred to as biosphere  for and gain on sale of equity investment was  in as compared with in this gain represents the gain we recorded when we received cash in exchange for our shares of vicuron pharmaceuticals  inc  referred to as vicuron  in connection with the merger of pfizer and vicuron in september income taxes income tax expense was  in as compared to in income tax expense in includes state tax expense and foreign income tax expense 
as we realized a loss from operations in and have historically realized net losses  we will continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets until profitability has been sustained over an appropriate time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we determine  based on future profitability  that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate material income tax benefit in the period of decrease and material income tax provisions in future periods 
critical accounting policies in december  the sec requested that all registrants discuss their most critical accounting policies in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note b to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are critical revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales  upon delivery  when title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer and collectability is reasonably assured 
we record revenues from product sales net of applicable allowances for returns  rebates and other applicable discounts and allowances 
the timing of product shipments and receipts can have a significant impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a period 
also  the majority of our products are sold through distributors 
revenue could be adversely affected if distributor inventories increased to an excessive level 
if this were to happen  we could experience reduced purchases in subsequent periods  or product returns from the distribution channel due to overstocking  low end user demand or product expiration 
we have invested in resources to track channel inventories in order to prevent distributor inventories from increasing to excessive levels 
if we determine that distributor inventories are at excessive levels  we do not recognize revenue for those shipments that we believe represent excessive inventory 
royalty revenue recognition royalty revenue is recognized based upon estimates of sales in licensed territories in the period in which the sales occur 
these estimates are derived when possible from information from the company paying the royalty  or from historical data and third party prescription data 
changes in market conditions  such as the introduction of competitive products  can lead to significant deviations from historical patterns and therefore cause estimates to be inaccurate 
when estimates differ from actual results  the difference is recognized in the following quarter  provided the difference is not material to the results of either quarter 
historically  our estimates have not materially differed from our actual results 
product sales allowances and reserves we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances payment term discounts  wholesaler fee for service discounts  government rebates and contractual discounts includes medicaid discounts  medicare discounts  managed care discounts  chargebacks and group purchasing organization  or gpo  contract discounts  returns and other discounts 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
based on known market events and trends  internal and external historical trends  third party data  customer buying patterns and up to date knowledge of contractual and statutory requirements  we are able to make reasonable estimates of sales discounts 
historically  our estimates have not materially differed from our actual results 
payment term discounts we offer our direct purchase customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on product sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary  and historical adjustments have not been material 
based on our history of estimating payment term discounts and the low dollar exposure  we do not anticipate that changes to estimates will have a material impact on net sales 
wholesaler fee for service discounts in both and  we entered into agreements with certain wholesaler customers that provide these wholesalers with the opportunity to earn discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services 
our effective rate of wholesaler fee for service discounts applied across all product gross sales in was approximately as compared to in our accruals for wholesaler fee for service discounts are based on actual data of product sales made to wholesale customers with agreements and not on estimates 
if the percentage of gross sales sold to wholesalers with agreements increases  our liability related to these discounts could increase materially 
government rebates and contractual discounts medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through the medicaid drug rebate program as a reduction of sales when the product is sold 
we rebate individual states for all eligible units purchased under the medicaid program based on a rebate per unit calculation  which is driven off of our average manufacturer price  or amp 
we estimate the expected rebate per unit to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on expected changes in rebate pricing 
we also examine the historical rebate trends and the trend of sales that become eligible for medicaid programs and any changes expected to these trends 
in addition  certain states have supplemental rebate programs  which provide such states with an additional rebate 
supplemental rebates  like rebates under the medicaid drug rebate program  are recorded as a reduction of sales when the product is sold 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced quarterly in arrears and paid thirty days after they are invoiced 
as a result  our accrual consists of i an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s prescriptions  ii an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates  and iii an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
we recorded a provision for medicaid rebates of and of gross sales in and  respectively 
the decrease is attributable to a change in the product mix with the commercial introduction of lunesta in the second quarter of  which has significantly lower medicaid eligible units than xopenex inhalation solution 
the decrease is also the result of a medicaid reserve reversal in the second quarter of relating to a estimate  in addition to a shift in patient coverage from medicaid to medicare part d  as a result of the introduction of the medicare part d program in actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected medicaid activity and rebate per unit amounts 
the most significant estimate we make in connection with this accrual is the estimate of the number of medicaid eligible units in the distribution channel 
in recent quarters  our estimates have been approximately accurate 
although the actual medicaid rebate may vary by more than of the estimated eligible medicaid units in future periods  we believe  based on prior experience  a variation in our estimate is reasonably likely 
a understatement of medicaid eligible units at december  would have resulted in an additional provision of approximately million 
medicare discounts part b we record accruals for rebates to be provided through medicare part b programs  as a reduction of sales when the product is sold 
we established a medicare part b rebate program in order to increase the access by medicare part b beneficiaries to our xopenex inhalation solution mg strength product through medicare part b pharmacy providers  or mpps 
we estimate the expected rebate using historical data and by examining trends and expected changes in medicare part b codes 
medicare part b payments are paid to mpps primarily on a monthly basis 
accordingly  the provision typically relates to the activity over a one month period and  as a result  the total provision consists of i an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current month s prescriptions  ii an accrual for prior months unpaid rebates  and iii an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
medicare discounts part d effective january   medicare created a prescription drug benefit for its beneficiaries known as medicare part d 
the cms contracted with numerous health plans and prescription drug benefit plans to design and administer the drug benefit  including the development of a formulary which defines which products are covered and at what co pay level 
we pay rebates to certain medicare part d health plans and prescription drug plans on the sale of lunesta and xopenex hfa 
xopenex inhalation solution has been  and we expect that it will remain  subject to reimbursement under medicare part b resulting in minimal medicare part d utilization 
our accruals for medicare part d are for rebates required for lunesta and xopenex hfa and are estimated based on projected sales volumes through the contracted health and drug plans 
the provision for both medicare rebates was of gross sales in and less than in actual medicare discounts could change significantly in the future based on future medicare reimbursement classifications 
medicare rebates at our current reimbursement levels represent an immaterial amount of sales rebates 
based on the accuracy of estimates and the small dollar amounts involved  we do not expect changes in estimates to have a material impact on net sales 
managed care discounts we have entered into agreements with certain mcos whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on the achievement of sales volume and or market share purchasing targets 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on discount rates and expected levels of sales volumes of these mcos during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and sales trends and expected changes to these trends 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears 
accordingly  our accrual consists of i the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s prescriptions  ii an accrual for prior quarters unpaid discounts  and iii an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
the provision for mco rebates was approximately and of gross sales in and  respectively 
actual mco discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
however  in part due to the fact that only a few organizations currently account for approximately of our mco discounts  our mco discount estimates have historically been very similar to the actual mco discounts 
we expect that a small number of organizations will continue to account for substantially all of our mco discounts for the foreseeable future and  therefore  do not expect significant changes to our mco discount estimates in future periods 
chargebacks and gpo contract discounts we have entered into agreements with certain gpos in which their members can purchase product from our wholesalers at a specified price 
gpos are organizations that represent a group of end buyers in the purchase of goods 
these agreements involve the wholesalers who receive a stated margin on sales to gpos 
when the difference between the wholesaler s purchase price and the gpo s price creates a margin less than the amount agreed between us and the wholesaler  the wholesaler requests a credit  which is referred to as a chargeback 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
we estimate eligible sales based on a history of the average actual chargebacks and an average of the chargeback cycle time  which is the time from when a wholesaler sells to a gpo until we issue a credit to the wholesaler 
we examine the history of sales which qualify for chargebacks and monitor sales trends and contractual changes 
our accrual consists of the amount expected to be incurred for the current sales in the calculated chargeback cycle  plus an accrual for estimated inventory in the distribution channel 
the provision for chargebacks and gpo contract credits was approximately and of gross sales in and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to an increase in discounts we offered on xopenex hfa sales 
offsetting this increase in the provision for chargebacks and gpo contract credits is a decrease due to a reversal of reserves relating to rebates under the department of veterans affairs tricare pharmacy benefits program  which was based on a us federal court of appeals ruling in september that pharmaceutical manufacturers are not required to provide reimbursement for drugs purchased through the tricare program 
actual chargeback and gpo contract credits could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
however  over the past few years  chargeback activity has been fairly stable with the exception of xopenex hfa  which currently has a limited number of chargeback contracts 
therefore  we do not expect significant variation between actual chargeback and gpo credits and our estimates 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our returned goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for xopenex inhalation solution is months  xopenex hfa is months and lunesta is months 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
customers can return product with six months or less of shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
we record an estimate for returns as reductions of revenue at the time product sales are recorded 
we base our estimates of product returns on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically and on a historical aging of the average time a return occurs from the time the product was sold 
for products with insufficient return history  we estimate by examining data of similar drugs 
for example  with lunesta  we researched industry data on return patterns of widely prescribed insomnia drugs 
we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could significantly impact our expected return percentages 
these factors include our estimate of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  the product shelf life of the product we have shipped  competitive issues such as new product entrants and other known changes in sales trends 
the provision for returns was approximately and in and  respectively 
the decrease in return percentage provision in from is due to the introduction of lunesta in the second quarter of  which has a significantly lower return percentage than xopenex inhalation solution  in addition to a decrease in actual returns for xopenex inhalation solution in the first nine months of compared to the same period in actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
based on these factors  and as a result of fluctuations observed in prior periods  we believe it is reasonably likely that the actual returns provision percentage could vary from the estimated percentage within a range of up to 
if the returns provision percentage for each of these products had increased by of gross sales in  an additional provision of approximately million would have been necessary 
many of our accruals include an estimate of inventory in the distribution pipeline 
at december   we believe a reasonable estimate of the value of our pipeline inventory in gross sales dollars is approximately million for xopenex inhalation solution  million for xopenex hfa and million for lunesta 
other discounts at times we offer special programs and discounts 
in and  we implemented discount programs related to the commercial introduction of lunesta and xopenex hfa to support the goal of making the products widely available 
these programs include discounts for auto shipments to pharmacies  coupons  and vouchers  including the lunesta night challenge introduced in september under the auto shipments to pharmacies program  we offer a discount during commercial introduction of new products to wholesalers that provide evidence that they have delivered product to an agreed upon number of pharmacies in a timely manner 
under the coupon program  physicians give patients coupons to purchase the prescribed drug at a discount from any retail pharmacy 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for these discounts through a third party administrator 
under the voucher and lunesta night challenge programs  physicians give patients vouchers to obtain free samples of the prescribed drug from any retail pharmacy 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we use the voucher program primarily in states where samples cannot be shipped directly to physicians 
in each case mentioned above  we estimate the cost of reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when the product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons and vouchers based on outstanding total coupons and vouchers and their historical usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such historical usage rate occurs 
each of these programs has a defined expiration date

we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral 
bad debt write offs were not significant in  and  however  they could be significant in the future and we monitor our receivables closely because a few customers make up a large portion of our overall revenues 
in and  our top three customers accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenues 
amortization  depreciation and certain long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
costs of major additions and betterments are capitalized  maintenance and repairs  which do not improve or extend the life of the respective assets  are charged to operations 
on disposal  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations as other income expense 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
computers and software  which are recorded in office equipment  have estimated useful lives of three years 
all laboratory  manufacturing and office equipment have estimated useful lives of three to ten years 
buildings have an estimated useful life of years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the remaining term of the lease 
deferred financing costs deferred financing costs relating to expenses incurred to complete convertible subordinated debt offerings are amortized evenly over the earlier of the term of the debt  or the date on which we can first be obligated to repurchase all or part of the debt 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to tax benefit carryforwards and to differences between the financial statement amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established if  based on management s review of both positive and negative evidence  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
our historical losses from operations represent significant negative evidence that indicates the need for a valuation allowance 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
of our total valuation allowance of  approximately  relates to stock option compensation deductions 
the tax benefit associated with the stock option compensation deductions will be credited to equity if realized 
if we determine  based on future profitability  that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized  a release of all  or part  of the related valuation allowance could result in an immediate material income tax benefit in the period of decrease and material income tax provisions in future periods 
induced conversion of debt we account for the conversion of convertible debt to equity securities pursuant to an inducement in accordance with statement of financial standards  or sfas  no 
 induced conversions of convertible debt 
we recognize as debt conversion expense  in other expense  an amount equal to the fair value of all securities and other consideration transferred in the transaction in excess of the fair value of securities issuable pursuant to the original conversion terms 
if we choose to induce conversion of debt to equity  this inducement charge could have a material impact on the financial results for the reporting period 
inventory write downs inventory represents bulk material  work in process and finished goods relating to our commercial products on hand  valued at lower of cost or market value 
inventories are reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete status based on sales activity  both projected and historical  and through a review of the expiration dates 
our current sales projections provide for full utilization of the inventory balance 
if product sales levels differ from projections  inventory may not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would write down the value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
we expense costs relating to inventory until such time as we receive an approval letter from the fda for a new product  and then we begin to capitalize the inventory costs relating to that product 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  which resulted in changes to our financial statements as detailed in note o to the financial statements 
determining the amount and distribution of expense for stock based compensation  as well as the associated impact to the balance sheets and statements of cash flows  requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation expense 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using the black scholes valuation model 
this valuation model takes into account the exercise price of the award  as well as a variety of assumptions 
these assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the expected term  the expected volatility of our stock over the expected term  the risk free interest rate over the expected term  and our expected annual dividend yield 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  we based the expected volatility of our stock on the historical price of our common stock 
upon our adoption of sfas r in january  we began utilizing implied volatility  derived from our traded options  to determine the volatility of our stock 
as required by sfas r  management has also made an estimate of expected forfeitures in determining the amount of expense to be recorded  and is recognizing compensation expense only for those equity awards expected to vest 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair value of stock based compensation expenses 
these estimates are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive equity awards 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin fin clarifies the application of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes by providing detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential effects of fin on our consolidated financial statements  and we anticipate that the interpretation will not have a significant impact on our results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted of research and development expenses  sales and marketing expenses  capital expenditures  working capital  debt service and general corporate expenses 
historically  we have funded these requirements and the growth of our business primarily through convertible subordinated debt offerings  the issuance of common stock  including the exercise of stock options  sales of our products and license agreements for our drug compounds 
we now expect to fund our liquidity requirements primarily with revenue generated from product sales 
we also believe we have the ability to meet our short term liquidity needs through the use of our cash and short term investments on hand at december  cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments totaled  or of total assets at december   compared to  or of total assets  at december  net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was  which includes net income of  our net income includes non cash charges of  consisting primarily of share based compensation and depreciation and amortization expense 
accounts receivable increased by  primarily due to lunesta and xopenex inhalation solution sales 
inventory decreased by  primarily due to a decline in raw material inventory as a result of the xopenex hfa introduction in and an effort to reduce the number of days of on hand inventory 
accrued expenses decreased by  primarily due to a decrease in accrued commission as a result of lower commission level achievement in as compared to and a decrease in sales and marketing accruals primarily due to the timing of vendor payments 
other current liabilities increased by  primarily due to an increase in accruals for product revenue rebates related to lunesta and xopenex hfa product sales 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was  cash provided by net sales of short and long term investments was  we made purchases of property and equipment of  and received proceeds from sales of equipment of  we also made an investment in acadia of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was  we received proceeds of  from issuing common stock upon the exercise of stock options issued under our stock option plans 
we also used  to repay capital lease obligations and long term debt 
we believe our existing cash and the cash flow we anticipate from operations and current strategic alliances will be sufficient to support existing operations through at least in the longer term  we expect to continue to fund our operations with revenue generated from product sales 
our actual future cash requirements and our ability to generate revenue  however  will depend on many factors  including lunesta sales  xopenex inhalation solution and xopenex hfa sales  successful commercialization of brovana  successful acquisition of technologies  product candidates  approved products and or businesses  our ability to establish and maintain additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements  progress of our preclinical and clinical research programs and the number and breadth of these programs  progress of our development efforts and the development efforts of our strategic partners  achievement of milestones under our strategic alliance arrangements  royalties from agreements with parties to which we have licensed our technology  and the outcome of pending litigation and or the informal sec inquiry 
if our assumptions underlying our beliefs regarding future revenues and expenses change  or if unexpected opportunities or needs arise  we may seek to raise additional cash by selling debt or equity securities or borrowing money from a bank 
however  we may not be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  or at all 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that we will not be required to raise additional capital to fund the repayment of our outstanding convertible debt when due  however we may choose to do so 
if we are not able to successfully continue to grow our revenue and properly manage our expenses  it is likely that our business would be materially and adversely affected and that we would be required to raise additional funds in order to repay our outstanding convertible debt 
we cannot assure that  if required  we would be able to raise the additional funds on favorable terms  if at all 
acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  approved products  product candidates and or technologies

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and equity prices  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
interest rates although our investments are subject to credit risk and interest rate risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and our investment portfolio is monitored for compliance with our investment policy 
the primary objective of the investment policy is the preservation of capital 
due to the conservative nature and relatively short duration of our investments  interest rate risk is mitigated 
the interest rates on our convertible subordinated debt and capital lease obligations are fixed and  therefore  not subject to interest rate risk 
equity prices our convertible subordinated debt is sensitive to fluctuations in the price of our common stock into which the debt is convertible 
changes in equity prices would result in changes in the fair value of our convertible subordinated debt due to the difference between the current market price of the debt and the market price at the date of issuance of the debt 
at december   a decrease in the price of our common stock could have resulted in a decrease of approximately  on the net fair value of our convertible subordinated debt
