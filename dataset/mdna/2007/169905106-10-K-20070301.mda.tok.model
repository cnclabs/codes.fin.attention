table of contents district of columbia and more than countries and territories outside the united states

the company conducts its international franchise operations through a combination of direct franchising and master franchising which allow the use of our brands by third parties in foreign countries 
the company has made equity investments in certain non domestic lodging franchise companies that conduct franchise operations for the company s brands under master franchising relationships 
as a result of our use of master franchising relationships and international market conditions  total revenues from international franchising operations comprised only and of our total revenues in and  respectively while representing approximately of our franchise system hotels open at december  and  respectively 
on october   the company acquired of the stock of choice hotels franchise gmbh chg 
chg was a wholly owned subsidiary of one of the company s master franchisees  che hotel group plc che 
under the master franchise agreement with che  chg franchised hotels under the company s brands in austria  germany  italy  czech republic and potions of switzerland 
as a result of this acquisition  the master franchise agreement between the company and che covering these countries terminated 
the results of chg have been consolidated with the company since october  on november   the company acquired che s assets  including franchise contracts  related to its franchising of hotels under the company s brands in france  belgium  portugal  spain and portions of switzerland 
as a result of acquisition  the master franchise agreement between the company and che covering these countries terminated and the company commenced direct franchising operations in these countries on november  these transactions enable choice to continue its strategy of more closely directing the growth of our franchise operations throughout continental europe 
during  the company acquired of the stock of suburban franchise holding company  inc suburban and its wholly owned subsidiary  suburban franchise systems  inc for million 
suburban is the franchisor of suburban extended stay hotels and at acquisition had units  rooms operating in the economy extended stay segment primarily in the southeastern united states 
the acquisition allowed the company to enter  on an accelerated basis  the economy extended stay segment  a market in which it did not previously compete 
the results of suburban have been consolidated with the company since september  on september   the company s board of directors declared a two for one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend 
the stock dividend was distributed on october  to shareholders of record on october  share data and earnings per share data included in md a reflect the stock split  applied retroactively  to all periods presented 
our company generates revenues  income and cash flows primarily from initial and continuing royalty fees attributable to our franchise agreements 
revenues are also generated from brand solutions formerly known as partner services endorsed vendor arrangements  hotel operations and other sources 
the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
for most hotels  demand is lower in december through march than during the remainder of the year 
our principal source of revenues is franchise fees based on the gross room revenues of our franchised properties 
the company s franchise fee revenues and operating income reflect the industry s seasonality and historically have been lower in the first quarter than in the second  third or fourth quarters 
with a focus on hotel franchising instead of ownership  we benefit from the economies of scale inherent in the franchising business 
the fee and cost structure of our business provides opportunities to improve operating results by increasing the number of franchised properties and effective royalty rates of our franchise contracts 
table of contents resulting in increased initial fee revenue  ongoing royalty fees and brand solutions revenues 
in addition  our operating results can also be improved through our company wide efforts related to improving property level performance 
in addition to these revenues  we also collect marketing and reservation fees to support centralized marketing and reservation activities for the franchise system 
as a lodging franchisor  choice has relatively low capital expenditure requirements 
the principal factors that affect the company s results are the number and relative mix of franchised hotels  growth in the number of hotels under franchise  occupancy and room rates achieved by the hotels under franchise  the effective royalty rate achieved  and our ability to manage costs 
the number of rooms at franchised properties and occupancy and room rates at those properties significantly affect the company s results because our fees are based upon room revenues at franchised hotels 
the key industry standard for measuring hotel operating performance is revenue per available room revpar  which is calculated by multiplying the percentage of occupied rooms by the average daily room rate realized 
our variable overhead costs associated with franchise system growth have historically been less than incremental royalty fees generated from new franchises 
accordingly  continued growth of our franchise business should enable us to realize benefits from the operating leverage in place and improve operating results 
we are contractually required by our franchise agreements to use the marketing and reservation fees we collect for system wide marketing and reservation activities 
these expenditures  which include advertising costs and costs to maintain our central reservations system  help to enhance awareness and increase consumer preference for our brands 
greater awareness and preference promotes long term growth in business delivery to our franchisees  which ultimately increases franchise fees earned by the company 
our company articulates its mission as a commitment to our customers profitability by providing our customers with hotel franchises that generate the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise 
we have developed an operating system dedicated to our franchisees success that focuses on delivering guests to our franchised hotels and reducing costs for our hotel owners 
we strive every day to continuously improve our franchise offerings to enhance our customers profitability and create the highest return on investment of any hotel franchise 
we believe that executing our strategic priorities creates value 
our company focuses on two key value drivers profitable growth 
our success is dependent on improving the performance of our hotels  increasing our system size by selling additional hotel franchises and effective royalty rate improvement 
we attempt to improve our franchisees revenues and overall profitability by providing a variety of products and services designed to increase business delivery to and or reduce operating and development costs for our franchisees 
these products and services include national marketing campaigns  a central reservation system  property and yield management systems  quality assurance standards and endorsed vendor relationships 
we believe that healthy brands  which deliver a compelling return on investment for franchisees  will enable us to sell additional hotel franchises and raise royalty rates 
we have established multiple brands that meet the needs of many types of guests  and can be developed at various price points and applied to both new and existing hotels 
this ensures that we have brands suitable for creating growth in a variety of market conditions 
improving the performance of the hotels under franchise  growing the system through additional franchise sales and improving franchise agreement pricing while maintaining a disciplined cost structure are the keys to profitable growth 
maximizing financial returns and creating value for shareholders 
our capital allocation decisions  including capital structure and uses of capital  are intended to maximize our return on invested capital and create value for our shareholders 
we believe our strong and predictable cash flows create a strong financial position that provides us a competitive advantage 
our business does not require significant capital to operate and grow  therefore  we can maintain a capital structure that generates high financial returns and use our excess cash flow to increase returns to our shareholders 
we have returned value to our shareholders in two primary ways share 
table of contents repurchases and dividends 
in  we instituted a share repurchase program which has generated substantial value for our shareholders 
through december   we have repurchased million shares including million prior to the two for one stock split effected in october of common stock at a total cost of million since the program s inception 
considering the effect of the two for one stock split  the company has repurchased million shares at an average price of per share through december  our cash flows from operations support our ability to complete the repurchase of approximately million shares presently remaining under our current board of directors authorization at december  the company expects to continue to return value to its shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases  subject to market and other conditions and upon completion of the current authorization we will evaluate the propriety of additional share repurchases with our board of directors 
in  we paid cash dividends totaling approximately million and we presently expect to continue to pay dividends in the future 
based on our present dividend rate and outstanding share count  aggregate annual dividends would be approximately million 
we believe these value drivers  when properly implemented  will enhance our profitability  maximize our financial returns and continue to generate value for our shareholders 
the ultimate measure of our success will be reflected in the items below 
results of operation royalty fees  operating income  net income and diluted earnings per share eps represent key measurements of these value drivers 
in  royalty fees revenue totaled approximately million  a increase compared to operating income totaled million for the year ended december   a increase from net income for the year ended december  increased million to million  a increase from diluted earnings per share were  a improvement over net income and diluted earnings per share for include a reduction of income tax expense related to the resolution of provisions for certain income tax contingencies of approximately million and a loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million million  net of the related tax effect related to the refinancing of the company s senior credit facility

in and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
since our business does not require significant reinvestment of capital  we utilize cash in ways that management believes provide the greatest returns to our shareholders which include share repurchases and dividends

critical accounting policies our accounting policies comply with principles generally accepted in the united states 
we have described below those policies that we believe are critical and require the use of complex judgment or significant estimates in their application 
additional discussion of these policies is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
the company accounts for initial  relicensing and continuing franchise fees in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for franchise fee revenue 
we recognize continuing franchise fees  including royalty  marketing and reservations fees  when earned and receivable from our franchisees 
franchise fees are typically based on a percentage of gross room revenues of each franchisee 
our estimate of the allowance for uncollectible royalty fees is charged to selling  general and administrative expense 
initial franchise and relicensing fees are recognized  in most instances  in the period the related franchise agreement is executed because the initial franchise and relicensing fees are non refundable and the company has no continuing obligations related to the franchisee 
we defer the initial franchise and relicensing fee revenue related to franchise agreements which include incentives until the incentive criteria are met or the agreement is terminated  whichever occurs first 
we account for brand solutions revenues from endorsed vendors in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 sab revenue recognition 
sab provides guidance on the recognition  
table of contents presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
pursuant to sab  the company recognizes brand solutions revenues when the services are performed or the product delivered  evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable 
we defer the recognition of brand solutions revenues related to certain upfront fees and recognize them over a period corresponding to the company s estimate of the life of the arrangement 
marketing and reservation revenues and expenses 
the company records marketing and reservation revenues and expenses in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which requires that these revenues and expenses be recorded gross 
in addition  net advances to and repayments from the franchise system for marketing and reservation activities are presented as cash flows from operating activities 
reservation fees and marketing fees not expended in the current year are carried over to the next fiscal year and expended in accordance with the franchise agreements 
shortfall amounts are similarly recovered in subsequent years 
cumulative excess or shortfall amounts from the operation of these programs are recorded as a marketing or reservation fee payable or receivable 
under the terms of the franchise agreements  the company may advance capital as necessary for marketing and reservation activities and recover such advances through future fees 
our current assessment is that the credit risk associated with the marketing fee receivable is mitigated due to our contractual right to recover these amounts from a large geographically dispersed group of franchisees 
choice privileges is our frequent guest incentive marketing program 
choice privileges enables members to earn points based on their spending levels at participating brands and  to a lesser degree  through participation in affiliated partners programs  such as those offered by credit card companies 
the points may be redeemed for free accommodations or other benefits 
points cannot be redeemed for cash 
the company collects a percentage of program members room revenue from participating franchises 
revenues are deferred in an amount equal to the fair value of the future redemption obligation 
a third party actuary estimates the eventual redemption rates and point values using various actuarial methods 
these judgmental factors determine the required liability for outstanding points 
upon redemption of the points  the company recognizes the previously deferred revenue as well as the corresponding expense relating to the cost of the awards redeemed 
revenues in excess of the estimated future redemption obligation are recognized when earned to reimburse the company for costs incurred to operate the program  including administrative costs  marketing  promotion and performing member services 
costs to operate the program  excluding estimated redemption values  are expensed when incurred 
impairment policy 
we evaluate the fair value of goodwill to assess potential impairments on an annual basis  or during the year if an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
we evaluate impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of our net assets with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we evaluate the potential impairment of property and equipment and other long lived assets  including franchise rights on an annual basis or whenever an event or other circumstance indicates that we may not be able to recover the carrying value of the asset 
our evaluation is based upon future cash flow projections 
these projections reflect management s best assumptions and estimates 
significant management judgment is involved in developing these projections  and they include inherent uncertainties 
if different projections had been used in the current period  the balances for non current assets could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if management uses different projections or if different conditions occur in future periods  future operating results could be materially impacted 

table of contents stock compensation

r 
sfas no 
r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method and began applying its provisions to i new awards  ii awards modified subsequent to the adoption date  iii any outstanding awards for which all requisite service has not yet been rendered 
under the modified prospective application method  compensation costs will be recognized on the unvested portion of awards at january  based on the grant date fair value used for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure over the remaining vesting period 
under this transition method  prior period results have not been restated 
the adoption of sfas no 
r reduced operating income and net income by approximately million and million  respectively for the year ended december  the adoption did not have a material impact on reported earnings per share or the company s financial statements since the company has been expensing share based awards granted since january  under the provisions of sfas no 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ending december  include million in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation resulting from the adoption of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
 cash flows from operating activities for the years ended december  and included million and million  respectively  of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
prior to january   the company accounted for stock based awards under apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  no stock based compensation cost was reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of income related to the grant of stock options which occurred prior to january   because the company accounted for those grants under apb opinion no 
and all such stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
therefore  the cost related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for the years ended and is less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value based method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of sfas no 
the effect on net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
to all stock compensation for the years ended and is set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
our income tax expense and related balance sheet amounts involve significant management estimates and judgments 
judgments regarding realization of deferred tax assets and the ultimate outcome of tax related contingencies represent key items involved in the determination of income tax expense and related balance sheet accounts 
the company does not provide additional united states income taxes on undistributed earnings of consolidated foreign subsidiaries included in retained earnings 
such earnings could become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these foreign subsidiaries or upon dividend repatriation 
the company s intent is for such earnings to be reinvested by the subsidiaries 
on october   the american jobs creation act of ajca was signed into law 
the ajca included a temporary one time incentive for united states multinational corporations to repatriate accumulated income of foreign subsidiaries by providing an percent dividends received deduction for qualifying dividends from controlled foreign corporations 
the company repatriated earnings pursuant to ajca totaling million in the fourth quarter of resulting in an income tax provision of million 
deferred tax assets represent items to be used as a tax deduction or credit in future tax returns for which we have already properly recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
realization of our deferred tax assets 
table of contents reflects our tax planning strategies 
we establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets that we do not believe will be realized 
tax assessments and resolution of tax contingencies may arise several years after tax returns have been filed 
predicting the outcome of such tax assessments involves uncertainty  however  we believe that recorded tax liabilities adequately account for our analysis of probable outcomes 
pension  profit sharing and incentive plans the company sponsors two non qualified retirement savings and investment plans for certain employees and senior executives 
employee and company contributions are maintained in separate irrevocable trusts
