item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report on form k including the disclosures under item a 
risk factors 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in us dollars 
executive summary we experienced another successful year in with the achievement of several significant financial and operating milestones 
driven by the continued growth of our sales of hiv products truvada  viread  atripla and emtriva  total product sales reached billion during  a increase over coupled with a significant increase in royalty revenue for the year  total revenues increased to billion 
sales from our hiv products of billion represented a increase over hiv product sales  primarily driven by the continued growth of truvada  especially in europe 
truvada product sales comprised more than half of our total hiv product sales 
the launch of atripla  the single tablet regimen of our truvada with bristol myers squibb company s bms sustiva efavirenz  in the united states in july and its successful uptake during the latter half of the year further contributed to the higher hiv product sales in over building on the momentum established by our joint venture with bms  in september  we established a three way joint venture with bms and merck co  inc merck  to hold the european marketing authorization for atripla 
this joint venture filed for marketing authorization with the european medicines agency in october  under the centralized licensing procedure 
if and when the marketing authorization application is finalized and approved  the joint venture will hold one marketing authorization in all member states of the european union 
discussions among the three companies regarding agreements for manufacturing  commercialization and distribution of atripla in the european union are ongoing 
the sales increases generated by the strong performance of truvada and atripla in were partially offset by a decrease in sales of viread in from due primarily to patients switching from a viread containing regimen to one containing truvada and or atripla in countries where truvada and or atripla are available 
despite facing continued strong competitive forces worldwide  sales of ambisome increased slightly by one percent compared to as previously anticipated  the availability of several new treatment options to patients living with hepatitis b infection has helped the hbv market expand 
hepsera product sales for increased from driven primarily by sales volume growth in europe 
in addition to growth in our product sales  royalty revenue increased significantly during the year 
of the million in royalty revenue that we recognized  million came from royalties on the sales of tamiflu by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd together with hoffmann la roche inc  roche 
tamiflu royalties increased from due to strong sales of tamiflu by roche  including sales of tamiflu related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide  as well as the elimination of the contractual cost of goods adjustment that was implemented in on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r and began expensing the fair value of stock based awards 
as a result  stock based compensation expense was a significant component of the increase in our operating costs and expenses for the year ended december  as compared to prior years 
further discussion regarding our adoption of sfas r is included in critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments below 
over the last few years  we focused on creating a solid foundation for long term growth as highlighted by the strong performance of our anti infectives in hiv  hbv and antifungals 
our strategy for building on this foundation continues to be through opportunities to acquire or in license and partner with innovative 
table of contents technologies or drug candidates and developing those technologies alongside our in house initiatives 
in  we further implemented this strategy by completing two significant acquisitions to acquire additional innovative technologies and drug candidates 
on august   we completed the acquisition of corus pharma  inc corus  a privately held development stage biopharmaceutical company based in seattle  washington  focused on the development and commercialization of novel drugs for respiratory and infectious diseases  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
corus had one product candidate in late stage clinical development  aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis who have pulmonary infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa 
on november   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of myogen  inc myogen  a publicly held biopharmaceutical company based in westminster  colorado that focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cardiovascular disorders  for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
myogen had two product candidates in late stage clinical development ambrisentan for the treatment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension and darusentan for the treatment of patients with resistant hypertension 
we believe our acquisitions of corus and myogen will provide us with an opportunity to expand into the respiratory and cardiopulmonary therapeutic areas 
in the clinic  we made considerable progress on compounds and drug candidates in licensed from our collaboration partners 
in hiv  during the first quarter of  we dosed the first patients in a phase clinical study of our novel integrase inhibitor for hiv  gs  which we licensed from japan tobacco inc japan tobacco in in february  we announced completion of a phase clinical trial and announced that the clinical study met its primary endpoint of non inferiority in viral load reduction in hiv positive patients 
in the hepatitis area  we completed enrollment of patients into our two pivotal phase clinical studies of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate for chronic hepatitis b in the second quarter of  and our collaboration partner  achillion pharmaceuticals  inc  began dosing hcv infected patients in a phase viral dynamics clinical study of gs  a small molecule inhibitor of hcv  in the fourth quarter of in february  based on preliminary data from the study  the companies decided to discontinue development of gs for hcv infection 
we filed an investigational new drug application with the fda for gs  a non nucleoside hcv polymerase inhibitor  for the potential treatment of hepatitis c and began dosing infected patients in the phase clinical study for gs during the fourth quarter of we anticipate data from our gs program in the second quarter of although we will continue to explore new opportunities where there is significant unmet medical need as part of our long term growth strategy  our primary focus for will be to develop our current pipeline  including those drug and product candidates from our corus and myogen acquisitions 
our success in  both commercially and from a research and development perspective  was the product of the strong global organization and infrastructure we built over the past several years 
we will continue to invest in infrastructure to facilitate continued strong growth in and beyond 
in  we relocated our european commercial  medical and administrative headquarters from france to the united kingdom  thereby uniting these functions with the regulatory  safety and information technology groups already headquartered in the united kingdom 
in  we undertook a strategic re alignment of our international commercial organization to better build  manage and expand our presence in new and existing markets 
during the year  we also began assessing and addressing the way in which we distribute product to the markets we serve as well as enhancing our manufacturing capabilities 
with the growth in demand for our products  the increased need for timely and adequate procurement of clinical materials and our focus on continuously looking at ways in which we can manufacture more efficiently and effectively  we completed the acquisition of raylo chemicals inc raylo  a wholly owned subsidiary of germany based specialty chemicals company degussa ag  in november for an aggregate purchase price of million 
located in edmonton  alberta  canada  raylo s operations encompassed custom manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredient api and advanced intermediates for the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries 
we intend to utilize the edmonton site for process research and scale up of our clinical development candidates  for the manufacture of our api for both investigational and commercial products  and for our chemical development activities to improve existing commercial manufacturing processes 

table of contents the cost of funding corporate development opportunities  building infrastructure and meeting daily operating needs  continued to be an area of management s focus in although we generated operating cash flows of billion during  we continued to explore ways of accessing cash in order to fund our corporate initiatives 
in april  we took advantage of favorable market and corporate conditions to issue billion principal amount of convertible senior notes 
concurrently  we repurchased million of our common stock under our stock repurchase program  purchased convertible note hedges at a cost of million and sold warrants for proceeds of million 
these transactions  along with our operating cash flows  helped to fund the significant cash outlays required during the year for the myogen  corus and raylo acquisitions and the million of payments made towards the principal on our term loan 
as a result  our december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance was billion 
we currently anticipate that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  along with our revolving credit facility that we have not yet used  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our focus for will be to continue building our infrastructure  advancing our drug candidates through the clinic and accomplishing our operational goals of promoting our products safety and efficacy data to drive higher patient adoption 
we also intend to continue building strong working relationships with our corporate partners  such as roche  with respect to tamiflu  bms and merck  with respect to atripla  and glaxosmithkline  with respect to hepsera 
due to the number of acquisitions made during  significant energy will be invested in to ensure that we successfully integrate the people  processes and systems at our edmonton  seattle and westminster sites 
we will also expend significant resources preparing for the launch of ambrisentan in the united states as well as the filing of a new drug application nda for aztreonam lysine for inhalation in the united states 
finally  we will continue to strengthen our global infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base  to better facilitate our expanding manufacturing  research  development and commercial activities  and to ensure that the activities undertaken by our employees continue to be executed within a framework of high integrity 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals  our tax provision and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant management judgments 

table of contents government rebates we estimate amounts payable by us to government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal and state government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  any new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs  and channel inventory data as obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during  and  million  million and million  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales for government rebates 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued government rebates of million and million  respectively  in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in these accrued government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total contract revenue contract revenue for research and development r d is recorded as performance occurs and the earnings process is completed based on the performance requirements of the contract 
nonrefundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and where there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized when the payments are received or when collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from non refundable up front license fees and milestone payments where we continue to have involvement  such as through a development collaboration or an obligation to supply product  is recognized as performance occurs and our obligations are completed 
in accordance with the specific terms of our obligations under these types of arrangements  revenues are recognized as the obligation is fulfilled or ratably over the development or manufacturing period 
revenues associated with substantive at risk milestones are recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we record write downs in the value of our inventory based on our review of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process as well as quality control reviews of our inventory 
we generally do not record inventory write downs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations 
prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory university emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating the emtricitabine technology 
the present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital 
we review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty 
some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor  significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls 
we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products  and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense 
as of december   we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory of million 
amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we 
table of contents accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros on a straight line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cro 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
on a budgeted basis  these costs are typically to of the total contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget  while start up costs for the particular trial do not change significantly 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed unit prices and can vary in length between six months for a single dose phase study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of truvada  viread  atripla  emtriva and hepsera 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and gilead is generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro at any point in time during the contract  regardless of payment status 
amounts paid in advance of services being performed will be refunded if a contract is terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study were not significant enough to require a material adjustment 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or has underestimated activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we would have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
as part of the purchase of myogen in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our acquired deferred tax assets related to state net operating loss carryforwards would not be realized and therefore established a valuation allowance of approximately million 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
such an adjustment was made in the fourth quarter of when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore  we released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in an income tax benefit for of approximately million 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  changes in our international organization  and changes in overall levels of income before tax 

table of contents our income tax returns are routinely audited by the various state and foreign tax authorities 
there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with tax filing positions 
while we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we record liabilities based upon sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any quarterly reporting period covered by our consolidated financial statements could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas r  which requires that all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under sfas r  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  no prior period amounts have been restated to reflect the provisions of sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we elected to follow apb  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 in accounting for our employee stock based plans 
under apb  if the exercise price of our employee and director stock options was equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
however  as required by sfas  the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan was disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions  however  we elected to continue using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning january  was calculated using the single option approach 
concurrent with our adoption of sfas r  we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility 
previously  we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data 
we estimate the weighted average expected life of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards 
we record stock based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r consistent with the expense attribution approach used in our historical sfas disclosures and using a straight line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of sfas r 
we currently believe that the straight line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided over the vesting period of our awards 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimated forfeitures based on our historical experience 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we will only recognize a benefit from stock based compensation in additional paid in capital apic if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the consolidated statement of operations rather than through apic 

table of contents during the year ended december   we recognized stock based compensation expense of million in operating expenses  and we capitalized million into inventory 
as of december   we had unrecognized stock based compensation of million related to nonvested stock options  which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of two years 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them 
results of operations total revenues we had total revenues of billion in  billion in and billion in included in total revenues are product sales  royalty revenue  and contract and other revenue 
product sales product sales for the last three years consisted of the following in thousands change change hiv products truvada viread atripla emtriva total hiv products sales hepsera ambisome other total product sales total product sales increased by in compared to  and in compared to  in each case  primarily due to an increase in the volume of sales of our hiv products 
a significant percentage of our product sales continue to be denominated in foreign currencies 
we use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in euro 
this reduces  but does not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
hiv products viread  emtriva  truvada and atripla were approved for sale in the united states in october  july  august and july  respectively 
viread  emtriva and truvada were approved for sale in the european union in february  october and february  respectively 
we are currently seeking approval of atripla for sale in the european union 
hiv product sales increased by compared to  and in compared to  primarily driven by product volume growth 
we experienced steady prescription gains for our hiv product portfolio throughout during  the average selling prices of our hiv products increased compared to  primarily driven by higher overall selling prices of our hiv products as well as the transition of some patients in the united states from coverage under medicaid to medicare part d  which reduced the amount of medicaid claims 
as a result of 
table of contents this transition  we estimated that assuming all patients dually eligible under medicaid did in fact transition to medicare part d  the benefit to net product sales resulting from a reduction in medicaid claims was approximately million for truvada truvada sales increased by in compared to  primarily driven by strong sales volume growth across the major geographic regions 
truvada sales accounted for and of our total hiv product sales for and  respectively  reflecting its strong position as the nrti backbone of choice in the united states  as well as rapid and significant uptake in key european territories during truvada sales increased in the united states in  the first full year of truvada sales  primarily due to patients new to therapy and secondarily  from patients switching from other regimens  including those containing viread and or emtriva 
viread viread sales decreased by in compared to  primarily due to patients switching from a viread containing regimen to one containing truvada in countries where truvada is available  partially offset by sales volume increases in latin america 
viread sales in were relatively consistent with sales levels in  resulting from the continued strong performance of viread despite the offsetting impact of patients switching from a viread containing regimen to one containing truvada in countries where truvada is available 
atripla atripla sales were million in since we consolidate of atripla product sales as we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with bms  these sales included approximately million relating to sustiva 
atripla was approved for sale in the united states in july and accounted for of our hiv product sales since its launch through december  emtriva emtriva sales decreased by in compared to and by in compared to the decreases in both years were primarily driven by the impact of patients switching from an emtriva containing regimen to one containing truvada and or atripla in countries where these products are available 
hepsera hepsera sales increased by in compared to and by in compared to  primarily driven by sales volume growth in both europe and the united states 
hepsera sales volume also increased with respect to our sales of hepsera to glaxosmithkline inc gsk 
we sell hepsera to gsk at our manufacturing cost in connection with gsk s distribution activities in asia 
royalties earned by us on sales of hepsera by gsk are recorded as royalty revenue 
ambisome sales of ambisome increased one percent in compared to  and increased by four percent in compared to the increases in both comparative periods were primarily due to increased sales in the united states 
ambisome product sales in the united states relate solely to our sales of ambisome to astellas pharma inc astellas which are recorded at our manufacturing cost 
royalties that we earn on sales of ambisome by astellas are discussed under royalty revenue below 
in both comparative periods  although ambisome sales volume increased in the european union  lower pricing in most regions slightly reduced the related net product sales that we recognized 
in  we expect our total product sales on our marketed products to continue to grow as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 

table of contents royalty revenue the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenue in thousands change change royalty revenue our most significant sources of royalty revenue for  and were from sales of tamiflu by roche and sales of ambisome in the united states by astellas 
royalty revenue for was million  an increase of compared to  primarily driven by the recognition of tamiflu royalties from roche of million in the increase in tamiflu royalties is due to the higher tamiflu sales recorded by roche  including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide  as well as the elimination of a contractual cost of goods adjustment resulting from the dispute resolution in november that had historically reduced the amount of tamiflu royalties recognized by us 
we recognize royalties on tamiflu sales by roche the quarter following the quarter in which it is sold 
royalty revenue for was million  an increase of compared to  primarily driven by the amounts received in connection with the dispute resolution discussed below  the recognition of the higher royalties received from roche for higher tamiflu sales caused by the significant flu season  particularly in japan  as well as the fulfillment of orders for pandemic readiness supplies in certain countries in in november  we resolved our dispute with roche relating to our development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between roche and us 
related to the dispute resolution  roche also paid us million that we recognized as royalty revenue in  which consisted of million relating to disputed royalties from to  million relating to the reimbursement of the contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties and million relating to the updating of royalties payable to us for the first nine months of based on the then current royalty rates instead of the prior year s effective royalty rate 
royalty revenue earned by us from roche  including the amounts recognized from the dispute resolution in  were million and million for and  respectively 
royalty revenue earned on sales of ambisome by astellas was million for  a seven percent decrease from  and was at million for each of and contract and other revenue the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our contract and other revenue in thousands change change contract and other revenue contract and other revenue was million in  a decrease of compared to in  contract and other revenue consisted primarily of net product distribution service revenue from sales of flolan  a million milestone payment we received from osi pharmaceuticals  inc osi related to the first commercial sale of macugen in the european union  revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects as well as the amortization of previously deferred milestone revenues 
in  contract and other revenue consisted primarily of a million milestone payment earned from osi  related to its first commercial sale of macugen in the united states in  revenue earned from various contract manufacturing projects as well as the amortization of previously deferred milestone revenues 

table of contents cost of goods sold and product gross margin the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales in thousands and cost of goods sold in thousands and product gross margin change change total product sales cost of goods sold product gross margin our product gross margin for was  compared to for the lower gross margin was primarily due to the launch of atripla in the united states  million in write downs of inventory for our gilead access program to its estimated net realizable value  as well as product mix changes as patients continue to switch from viread  a higher margin product  to truvada and or atripla  partially offset by the lower effective royalty rate resulting from our july emtricitabine royalty buyout discussed below  lower api costs and the higher average selling prices of our hiv products in the united states 
atripla product sales decreased our product gross margin  without a corresponding impact to our product gross profit 
as the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with bms  we consolidate of atripla product sales but only benefit from the product gross margin on the truvada portion of atripla 
the sustiva portion of atripla product sales carries a zero product gross profit since the joint venture purchases sustiva api from bms at bms s estimated net selling price of sustiva in the us market 
our product gross margin for was  compared to for  primarily due to product mix changes as patients switched from viread  a higher margin product  to truvada 
prior to july  we paid royalties to emory on worldwide net sales of product containing emtrcitabine 
in july  we and royalty pharma purchased and  respectively  of the royalty interest owned by emory in exchange for the elimination of the royalty obligation 
as a result of the purchase  we capitalized million in prepaid royalties  representing our share of the million purchase price 
in the third quarter of  we began to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales of products containing emtricitabine 
we recorded royalties to royalty pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to royalty pharma s ownership interest in the underlying emory royalty interest 
we expect our product gross margin in to be lower  driven by the higher mix of atripla product sales  which include the sustiva portion at zero product gross profit  partially offset by gross margin improvements driven by lower api costs and the continued benefit associated with our prepaid emtricitabine royalties 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our r d expenses over the last three years in thousands change change research clinical development pharmaceutical development total research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  clinical studies performed by cros  materials and supplies  licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our r d activities are separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs 
clinical development costs include costs for phase   and clinical trials 
pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis

these higher expenses were partially offset by lower milestone payments made to japan tobacco in compared to related to the licensing and development of our lead integrase inhibitor candidate  gs  as well as a million payment to emory in in connection with the amendment of our license agreement with emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis b indication 
in general  significant collaboration payments  as seen in our payments to japan tobacco and emory  during a period can cause our r d expenses to fluctuate period over period 
r d expenses in increased by million compared to  primarily due to the million payment made to emory mentioned above  a million payment made to japan tobacco related to the execution of our hiv integrase license agreement for gs  increased compensation and benefits of million from higher headcount and increased clinical and product development activities associated with our hiv and hepatitis programs 
the payments made to emory and japan tobacco were expensed as the underlying technologies were incomplete and had no alternative future use  and in the case of emory  no significant r d activities are expected in the next several years 
in  we expect r d expenses to increase over levels reflecting increased spending on our internal and collaborative r d efforts  as well as product licensing activity relating to our expectation that our product candidates will progress into more advanced clinical trials  especially in the respiratory and cardiopulmonary areas 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses over the last three years in thousands change change selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for increased by million compared to higher expenses were primarily driven by higher headcount which increased compensation and benefits by million including stock based compensation expense of million from our adoption of sfas r on january   increased expenses of million in contract services and promotional programs relating to our business growth  business development activities and activities to prepare us for the launch of atripla and a million write off of certain capital assets related to renovations at our corporate headquarter campus 
in addition  beginning in  we began reporting net foreign exchange transaction gains or losses as well as fair value changes on derivative instruments not designated as hedges in interest and other income  net 
these amounts  which were previously reported as sg a expenses  were reclassified to enhance the comparability of our financial statements with those of other companies 
prior year amounts  although insignificant  have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation 
sg a expenses for increased by million compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits of million due largely to higher headcount  an increase in market research  speaker s programs and symposia costs of million  million of severance and relocation expenses associated with the relocation of our european commercial  medical and administrative headquarters from france to the united kingdom  an increase in medical education costs of million  an increase in journal advertising costs of million  as well as costs related to a general expansion of our sales and marketing activities worldwide 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million as a result of higher collections activity in certain european countries 

table of contents in  we expect sg a expenses to increase primarily due to higher costs to be incurred on administrative activities and sales and marketing efforts to support our business growth  as well as on the sales force expansion planned for the anticipated ambrisentan launch in the united states  higher costs related to our ongoing investment in our global commercial organization through additional hiring and promotional programs  as well as incremental operating expenses associated with our acquisitions of corus and myogen 
purchased in process research and development in connection with our acquisitions of myogen and corus  we recorded purchased in process research and development ipr d expense of billion and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the purchased ipr d expense for myogen represented the estimated fair value of myogen s incomplete research and development programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and  therefore  was expensed upon acquisition

the estimated fair value of the purchased ipr d was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
we estimated the related future net cash flows using a present value risk adjusted discount rate of  which is a significant assumption and is based on the estimated internal rate of return for myogen s operations and is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with myogen s profile 
the projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related products  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program  we estimated that the program was approximately complete as of the acquisition date  based on estimated time and cost to complete  as phase clinical trials had been completed 
based on this assumption  we would incur future research and development costs of approximately million to million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization is expected to occur

material net cash inflows are estimated to begin in for darusentan  assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date 
the remaining efforts for completing myogen s ipr d programs primarily consist of clinical trials  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict  and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development  including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials  the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approvals 
feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed 
we cannot be certain that either ambrisentan or darusentan  purchased from myogen  will be approved in the united states or in countries outside of the united states or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use 
future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review  which may differ materially from current projections 
the acquired product candidates under development may never be successfully commercialized 
as a result  we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of these product candidates if  for example  we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline 
if these programs cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all  then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of the projects will materialize as estimated

gain on warrant pursuant to our march agreement with eyetech pharmaceuticals  inc eyetech  as predecessor to osi  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of eyetech series b convertible preferred stock  exercisable at a price of per share 
in january  eyetech completed an initial public offering of its common stock at which time we adjusted the fair value of the warrant resulting in a gain of million 
at that time  the fair value of the warrant was estimated using the black scholes valuation model with a volatility rate of and a discount rate of 
at the end of the first quarter of  we exercised the warrant on a net basis using shares of eyetech common stock as consideration for the exercise price and subsequently held  shares of eyetech common stock

these working capital decreases were partially offset by million increase in inventories primarily due to the increase in atripla inventory which included sustiva api at bms s approximate market value of sustiva  and million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in and the lower receivables collections in certain european countries where collections traditionally have been slower 
working capital at december  was billion compared to billion at december  significant factors that resulted in an increase in working capital were billion increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  million increase in inventories to meet growing demand in our hiv products and hepsera as well as to meet our gilead access program requirements  million increase in prepaids and other current assets primarily related to the current portion of our prepaid royalties to emory for emtricitabine  million increase in deferred tax assets  and million increase in accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales in  partially offset by higher collection activity especially in certain european countries where collections traditionally have been slower

cash provided by operating activities of million in was comprised primarily of million of net income which was adjusted for non cash items such as million of deferred income taxes primarily resulting from the utilization of net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards to offset taxable income 
this was partially offset by million of net cash outflow related to changes in operating assets and liabilities  which included million increase in accounts receivable primarily resulting from our product sales growth

capital expenditures made in  and related primarily to expanding certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities  upgrading our facilities  as well as additional spending on computer and laboratory equipment to accommodate our continued growth 
in  capital expenditures also included the purchase of two buildings that we previously leased at our foster city  california headquarters 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities in april  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due and million principal amount of convertible senior notes due collectively  the notes in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
part of the net proceeds from the notes issuances of billion  after deducting the initial purchasers discount and the estimated offering expenses  were used to repurchase million of our common stock 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we purchased convertible note hedges in private transactions at a cost of million 
we also sold warrants to acquire million shares of our common stock in private transactions and received net proceeds of million 
taken together  the convertible note hedges and warrants are intended to reduce the potential dilution upon future conversions of the notes by effectively increasing the initial conversion price of the notes 
in total  these transactions generated net proceeds of million for us 
cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily resulting from the million of net proceeds generated from the issuance of our notes and related transactions mentioned above 
in addition  we received proceeds from employee stock option exercises of million  as well as million of excess tax benefits from stock option exercises

other information as of december   we had an uncollateralized revolving credit facility of million of which there were no outstanding amounts 
the capacity of the revolving credit facility will continue to increase to a maximum of million commensurate with the repayments of principal under our term loan 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our r d efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the possibility of acquiring manufacturing capabilities or additional office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies  and defense costs associated with  settlements of and adverse results of litigation and government investigations 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations  capital and operating leases  as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments  purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items and clinical trials contracts

at december   we had firm commitments to purchase active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items 
the amounts disclosed only represent minimum purchase requirements 
actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
although most of our contracts with cros are cancelable  we generally have not cancelled such contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts 
excludes interest related payments on convertible senior notes  term loan and capital lease obligations 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our sales denominated in foreign currency  as well as foreign currency denominated net monetary assets and liabilities 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
increases in the value of the us dollar against these foreign currencies in the past have reduced  and may in the future reduce our us dollar return on these sales and negatively impact our financial condition 
we use forward contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in the euro currency 
in recent years  foreign currency exchange fluctuations have both positively and negatively impacted product sales and gross margin  however  the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedge program 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  all contracts have maturities of one year or less 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of foreign currency per us dollar 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands currency notional amount average rate fair value british pound euro australian dollar total the total notional amount of billion and total fair value of our liability of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  compares with a total notional amount of million and a total fair value relating to our asset of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to our investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 

table of contents the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest generating assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  dollars in thousands years ending december  thereafter total fair value at december  assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes average interest rate term loan  including current portion average interest rate capital lease obligations  including current portion average interest rate in april  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes and million principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes and notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of and  respectively  and may be converted subject to certain circumstances 
in december  we entered into a million  five year term loan 
the average interest rates are based on implied three month libor forward rates in the yield curve at december  we have an option to choose borrowing maturity based on a one  two  three or six month libor 
under the terms of the loan  the minimum principal amount to be repaid at the end of each calendar quarter  beginning march   is five percent of the outstanding amount 
interest is accrued at a rate of libor plus a tiered contractual rate of up to basis points 
we can prepay the term loan at any time in whole or in part  together with accrued interest on the prepaid principal  without penalty or premium 
during the year ended december   million of the term loan principal was repaid 
any outstanding interest or principal at december is payable on demand 
international credit risk our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  compared to million at december  the growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales of our hiv products in the united states and europe 
in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  italy  portugal and spain  our aggregated accounts receivable balance was significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled million  of which million was more than days past due based on contractual terms of the receivables 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable  and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally have not required collateral
