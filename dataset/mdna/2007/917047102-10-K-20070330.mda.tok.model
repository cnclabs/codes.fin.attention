item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly results for additional information 
item a 
risk factors our business segments are sensitive to economic conditions  consumer spending  shifts in fashion and industry and demographic conditions 
we are subject to seasonal variations and face numerous business risk factors 
consumer purchases of discretionary retail items and specialty retail products  including our products  may decline during recessionary periods and also may decline at other times when disposable income is lower 
a prolonged economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there is a risk that consumer sentiment may decline due to economic and or geo political factors  which could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations 
we rely heavily on our ability to identify changes in fashion 
customer tastes and fashion trends are volatile and can change rapidly 
our success depends in part on our ability to effectively predict and respond to changing fashion tastes and consumer demands  and to translate market trends into appropriate  saleable product offerings 
our inability to effectively determine these changes may lead to higher seasonal inventory levels and a future need to increase markdowns to liquidate our inventory 
compared to our retail segments  our wholesale business is more sensitive to changes in fashion trends because of longer lead times in the manufacture and sale of its apparel 
while we do not plan for mistakes in our fashion offering selections  our fashion decisions constitute a material risk and may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in expanding our business and opening new retail stores 
our growth strategy depends on our ability to open and operate new retail stores on a profitable basis 
our operating complexity will increase as our store base grows  and we may face challenges in managing our future growth 
such growth will require that we continue to expand and improve our operating capabilities  and expand  train and manage our employee base 
we may be unable to hire and 
table of contents train a sufficient number of qualified personnel or successfully manage our growth 
our expansion prospects also depend on a number of other factors  many of which are beyond our control  including  among other things  competition  the availability of financing for capital expenditures and working capital requirements  the availability of suitable sites for new store locations on acceptable lease terms  and the availability of inventory 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our store expansion goals  nor can there be any assurance that our newly opened stores will achieve revenue or profitability levels comparable to those of our existing stores in the time periods estimated by us  or at all 
if our stores fail to achieve  or are unable to sustain  acceptable revenue and profitability levels  we may incur significant costs associated with closing those stores 
existing and increased competition in the specialty retail  direct to consumer and wholesale apparel businesses may reduce our net revenues  profits and market share 
the specialty retail  direct to consumer and the wholesale apparel businesses are each highly competitive 
our retail stores compete on the basis of  among other things  the location of our stores  the breadth  quality  style  and availability of merchandise  the level of customer service offered and merchandise price 
our anthropologie and free people stores also face competition from small boutiques that offer an individualized shopping experience similar to the one we strive to provide to our target customers 
in addition  some of our suppliers offer products directly to consumers and certain of our competitors 
our free people wholesale business competes with numerous wholesale companies based on the quality  fashion and price of our wholesale product offerings  many of whose products have wider distribution than ours 
many of our competitors have substantially greater name recognition as well as financial  marketing and other resources 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors 
our expansion into markets served by our competitors and entry of new competitors or expansion of existing competitors into our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain or replace these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our business 
we believe that we have benefited substantially from the leadership and experience of our senior executives  including our chairman  president and co founder  richard a 
hayne  and the president of anthropologie  inc  glen t 
senk 
the loss of the services of any of our senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects  as we may not be able to find suitable management personnel to replace departing executives on a timely basis 
we do not have an employment agreement with mr 
hayne  mr 
senk or any of our other key personnel 
in addition  as our business expands  we believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel 
there is a high level of competition for personnel in the retail industry 
our inability to meet our staffing requirements in the future  at costs that are favorable to us  or at all  could impair our ability to increase revenue and could otherwise harm our business 

table of contents we could be materially and adversely affected if any of our distribution centers are shut down 
we operate three distribution facilities worldwide to support our retail and wholesale business segments in the united states  western europe and canada  and for fulfillment of catalog and web site orders 
we have also engaged a third party to operate an additional distribution facility in reno  nevada to service our stores in the western united states and utilize a portion of the toronto urban outfitters store as a wholesale distribution facility in canada 
the merchandise purchased for our retail operation is shipped directly to our distribution centers in lancaster county  pennsylvania and reno  nevada while merchandise purchased for our direct to consumer and wholesale operations is shipped directly to our distribution center in edgefield county  south carolina 
if any of our distribution centers were to shut down for any reason the other distribution centers may not be able to support the resulting additional distribution demands 
as a result  we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with distributing our products to our stores during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace the center 
we rely significantly on foreign sources of production 
we receive a substantial portion of our apparel and other merchandise from foreign sources  both purchased directly in foreign markets and indirectly through domestic vendors with foreign sources 
to the extent that our vendors are located overseas or rely on overseas sources for a large portion of their products  any event causing a disruption of imports  including the imposition of import restrictions  war and acts of terrorism could adversely affect our business 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be adversely affected 
the flow of merchandise from our vendors could also be adversely affected by financial or political instability in any of the countries in which the goods we purchase are manufactured  if the instability affects the production or export of merchandise from those countries 
trade restrictions in the form of tariffs or quotas  or both  applicable to the products we sell could also affect the importation of those products and could increase the cost and reduce the supply of products available to us  in addition  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could increase the cost of products we purchase from overseas vendors 
our operating results fluctuate from period to period 
our business experiences seasonal fluctuations in net sales and operating income  with a significant portion of operating income typically realized during the five month period from august to december of each year the back to school and holiday periods 
any decrease in sales or margins during this period  or in the availability of working capital needed in the months preceding this period  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
seasonal fluctuations also affect our inventory levels  as we usually order merchandise in advance of peak selling periods and sometimes before new fashion trends are confirmed by customer purchases 
we must carry a significant amount of inventory  especially before the back to school and holiday selling periods 
if we are not successful in selling our inventory during this period  we may be forced to rely on markdowns or promotional sales to dispose of the inventory or we may not be able to sell the inventory at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we may be unable to protect our trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
we believe that our trademarks and service marks are important to our success and our competitive position due to their name recognition with our customers 
we devote substantial resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and service marks on a worldwide basis 
in order to more effectively protect them from infringement and to defend against claims of infringement  the marks are owned by separate subsidiaries whose purpose is to maintain and manage existing and future marks  thereby increasing their value to the company 
we are not aware of any valid claims of infringement or challenges to our right to use any of our trademarks and service marks in the united states 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that the actions we have taken to establish and protect our trademarks and service marks will be adequate to prevent imitation of our products by others or to prevent others from seeking to block sales of our products as a violation of the trademarks  service marks and proprietary rights of others 
also  others may assert rights in  or ownership of  trademarks and other proprietary rights of ours and we may not be able to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
war  acts of terrorism  or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and otherwise adversely impact our business 
in the event of war or acts of terrorism  or if either are threatened  our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores may be negatively impacted 
a substantial portion of our merchandise is imported from other countries  see we rely significantly on foreign sources of production on page if commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores  as well as fulfilling catalog and web site orders 
in the event of war or additional acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  we may be required to suspend operations in some or all of our stores  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in introducing additional store concepts 
we may  from time to time  seek to develop and introduce new concepts or brands in addition to our existing urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people brands 
our ability to succeed in these new concepts could require significant capital expenditures and management attention 
additionally  any new concept is subject to certain risks  including customer acceptance  competition  product differentiation  challenges relating to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing and the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  including management and designers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and grow these or any other new concepts to a point where they will become profitable  or generate positive cash flow 
if we cannot successfully develop and grow these new concepts  our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
item b 
unresolved staff comments we have no outstanding comments with the staff of the sec 

table of contents item properties in august  we moved and consolidated our home office into several buildings on one campus in the historic core of the philadelphia  pennsylvania navy yard 
this acquisition allows for a more efficient operation of our philadelphia based offices and will support our growth needs for at least the next ten years 
the property located at south broad street in philadelphia is approximately five miles from our previous philadelphia based home offices 
we currently occupy approximately  square feet at the navy yard 
options on several adjacent buildings are also available for at least the next ten years to allow for additional expansion if necessary 
we spent approximately million on improvements made to our offices at the navy yard as of january  the expenditures to improve our navy yard facilities were capitalized and are being depreciated based on the useful life of the improvements and fixtures 
our customer contact center is located in edgefield county  south carolina as part of our  square foot distribution center  and occupies approximately  square feet 
our office in europe is located at market place in london and occupies approximately  square feet of space 
our home offices and customer contact facilities are leased properties with varying lease term expirations through we own a  square foot distribution center in lancaster county  pennsylvania 
we also utilize a distribution facility in reno  nevada operated by a third party 
for more information on our distribution center properties  see item business company operations distribution 
we believe that our facilities are well maintained and in good operating condition 
in fiscal  we anticipate securing our own distribution center on the west coast of the united states to support our western stores 
we expect the facility will be financed through an operating lease  however  we expect to spend to million on equipment and other improvements 

table of contents all of our urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people stores are leased and are well maintained and in good operating condition 
our retail stores are typically leased for a term of ten years with renewal options for an additional five to ten years 
total estimated selling square feet for stores open  under lease at january   by urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people was approximately   and  respectively 
the average store selling square feet is approximately  for urban outfitters   for anthropologie and  for free people 
selling square feet can sometimes change due to floor moves  use of staircases  cash register configuration and other factors

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate two business segments  a lifestyle merchandising retailing segment and a wholesale apparel segment 
our retailing segment consists of our urban outfitters  anthropologie and free people brands  whose merchandise is sold directly to our customers through our stores  catalogs  call centers and web sites 
our wholesale apparel segment consists of our free people wholesale division that designs  develops and markets young women s contemporary casual apparel 
a store is included in comparable store net sales data  as presented in this discussion  if it has been open at least one full fiscal year prior to fiscal  unless it was materially expanded or remodeled within that year or was not otherwise operating at its full capacity within that year 
sales from stores that do not fall within the definition of a comparable store are considered non comparable 
furthermore  non store sales  such as catalog and internet sales  are also considered non comparable 
although we have no precise empirical data as it relates to customer traffic or customer conversion rates in our stores  we believe that  based only on our observations  changes in transaction volume  as discussed in our results of operations  correlate to changes in customer traffic 
we believe this may be caused by a combination of response to our brands fashion offerings  our web advertising  additional circulation of our catalogs and an overall growth in brand recognition as we expand our store base  including expansion into enclosed malls and specialty retail centers 
our fiscal year ends on january all references in this discussion to our fiscal years refer to the fiscal years ended on january in those years 
for example  our fiscal ended on january  the comparable store net sales data presented in this discussion is calculated based on the net sales of all stores open at least full months at the beginning of the period for which such data is presented 
our goal is to increase net sales by at least per year through a combination of opening new stores  growing comparable store sales and continuing the growth of our direct to consumer and wholesale operations 
retail stores as of january   we operated urban outfitters stores of which are located in the united states  three are located in canada and nine are located in europe 
during fiscal  we opened new urban outfitters stores  of which are located within the united states and two of which are located in europe 
urban outfitters targets young adults aged to through a unique merchandise mix and compelling store environment 
our product offering includes women s and men s fashion apparel  footwear and accessories  as well as an eclectic mix of apartment wares and gifts 
we plan to open additional stores over the next several years  some of which may be outside the united states 
urban s north american and european store sales accounted for approximately and of consolidated net sales  respectively  for fiscal we operated anthropologie stores as of january   all of which are located in the united states

anthropologie tailors its merchandise to sophisticated and contemporary women aged to our product assortment 
table of contents includes women s casual apparel and accessories  home furnishings and a diverse array of gifts and decorative items 
we plan to open additional stores over the next several years 
anthropologie s store sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal we operated eight free people stores as of january   all of which are located in the united states 
during fiscal we opened two new free people stores 
free people primarily offers private label branded merchandise targeted to young contemporary women aged to free people provides a unique merchandise mix of casual women s apparel  accessories and gifts 
we plan to open additional stores over the next several fiscal years 
free people s retail sales accounted for less than of consolidated net sales for fiscal for all brands combined  we plan to open at least stores during fiscal  including six to ten new free people stores 
the remaining new stores will be divided approximately evenly between urban outfitters and anthropologie 
we plan to grow our store base by approximately per year 
direct to consumer in march  anthropologie introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise  most of which is also available in our anthropologie stores 
during fiscal  we circulated approximately million catalogs and believe that this catalog has been instrumental in helping to build the anthropologie brand identity with our target customers 
we plan to modestly expand circulation to approximately million catalogs during fiscal and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years 
anthropologie operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
anthropologie 
com  debuted in december the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar array of apparel  accessories  household and gift merchandise as found in the stores 
as with our catalog  we believe that the web site increases anthropologie s reputation and brand recognition with its target customers and helps support the strength of anthropologie s store operations 
in march  urban outfitters introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise  much of which is also available in our urban outfitters stores 
during fiscal  we circulated approximately million urban outfitters catalogs 
we believe this catalog has expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness 
we plan to expand circulation to approximately million in fiscal and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years 
urban outfitters also operates a web site that accepts orders directly from consumers 
the web site  www 
urbanoutfitters 
com  was launched in may the web site captures the spirit of the store by offering a similar selection of merchandise as found in the stores 
as with the urban outfitters catalog  we believe the web site increases the reputation and recognition of the brand with its target customers  as well as helps to support the strength of urban outfitters store operations 
in august  urban outfitters launched a web site targeting our european customers

com  in september the web site offers consumers the entire free people product assortment found at free people retail stores as well as all of the free people wholesale offerings 
in october  free people introduced a direct to consumer catalog offering selected merchandise much of which is also available in our free people stores 
in fiscal  we circulated approximately million free people catalogs which expanded our distribution channels and increased brand awareness 
we plan to expand circulation to approximately million catalogs in fiscal and intend to increase the level of catalog circulation over the next few years 
direct to consumer sales were approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal wholesale the free people wholesale division designs  develops and markets young women s contemporary casual apparel 
free people s range of tops  bottoms  sweaters and dresses are sold worldwide through approximately  better department and specialty stores  including bloomingdale s  lord taylor  parisian  nordstrom  urban outfitters and our own free people stores 
free people wholesale sales accounted for approximately of consolidated net sales for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
our senior management has reviewed the critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
if actual results were to differ significantly from estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would cause our actual results to be materially different from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the point of sale for retail store sales or when merchandise is shipped to customers for wholesale and direct to consumer sales  net of estimated customer returns 
payment for merchandise at our stores and through our direct to consumer business is by cash  check  credit card  debit card or gift card 
therefore  our need to collect outstanding accounts receivable for our retail and 
table of contents direct to consumer business is negligible and mainly results from returned checks or unauthorized credit card charges 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for our wholesale business accounts receivable which management reviews on a regular basis and believes is sufficient to cover potential credit losses and billing adjustments 
deposits for custom orders are recorded as a liability and recognized as a sale upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
these custom orders  typically for upholstered furniture  have not been material 
gift card sales to customers are initially recorded as liabilities and recognized as sales upon redemption 
sales return reserve we record a reserve for estimated product returns where the sale has occurred during the period reported  but the return is likely to occur subsequent to the period reported and may otherwise be considered in transit 
the reserve for estimated in transit product returns is based on our most recent historical return trends 
if the actual return rate or experience is materially different than our estimate  the reserve will be adjusted in the future 
as of january  and  reserves for estimated sales returns in transit totaled million and million  representing and of total liabilities  respectively 
inventories we value our inventories  which consist primarily of general consumer merchandise held for sale  at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the first in  first out method and includes the cost of merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of inventory quantities on hand is performed in order to determine if inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
factors related to current inventories  such as future consumer demand and fashion trends  current aging  current and anticipated retail markdowns or wholesale discounts  and class or type of inventory  are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values 
criteria we use to quantify aging trends includes factors such as average selling cycle and seasonality of merchandise  the historical rate at which merchandise has sold below cost during the average selling cycle  and inventory currently priced below its original cost 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to its estimated net realizable value  if required 
net inventories as of january  and january  totaled million and million  representing and of total assets  respectively 
any significant unanticipated changes in the risk factors noted within this report could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
adjustments to reserves related to the net realizable value of our inventories are primarily based on the market value of our physical inventory at january  and recent historical trends 
our estimates generally have been accurate and our reserve methods have been applied on a consistent basis 
we expect the amount of our reserves to increase over time as we expand our store base and accordingly  related inventories 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist principally of store leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and buildings  and are included in the property and equipment  net line item in our consolidated balance sheets included in this report 
store leasehold improvements are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over the lesser of the applicable store lease term  including 
table of contents lease renewals which are reasonably assured  or the estimated useful life of the leasehold improvements 
the typical initial lease term for our stores is ten years 
buildings are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over years 
furniture and fixtures are recorded at cost and are amortized using the straight line method over their useful life  which is typically five years 
net property and equipment as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
in assessing potential impairment of our store related assets  we periodically evaluate historical and forecasted operating results and cash flows on a store by store basis 
newly opened stores may take time to generate positive operating and cash flow results 
factors such as store type eg  mall versus free standing  store location eg  urban area versus college campus or suburb  current marketplace awareness of our brands  local customer demographic data and current fashion trends are all considered in determining the time frame required for a store to achieve positive financial results  which  in general  is assumed to be measurable within three years from the date a store location has opened 
if economic conditions are substantially different from our expectations  the carrying value of certain of our long lived assets may become impaired 
for fiscal  and  write downs of long lived assets were not material 
we have only closed three store locations in our history  which in all cases  were eventually re located  and took place at the expiration of the lease and renewal terms 
we have not historically encountered material early retirement charges related to our long lived assets 
the cost of assets sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation or amortization is removed from the accounts with any resulting gain or loss included in net income 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operating expense as incurred 
major renovations or improvements that extend the service lives of our assets are capitalized over the extension period or life of the improvement  whichever is less 
we did not close any store locations in fiscal as of the date of this report  all of our stores opened in excess of three years are expected to generate positive annual cash flow before allocation of corporate overhead 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes  such as depreciation of property and equipment and valuation of inventories 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if adequate taxable income is not generated in future periods 
deferred tax assets as of january  and january  totaled million and million  respectively  representing and of total assets  respectively 
to the extent we believe that recovery of an asset is at risk  we establish valuation allowances 
to the extent we establish valuation allowances or increase the allowances in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
we reduced valuation allowances to million as of january  from million as of january  this reduction occurred based on evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future 
table of contents taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions 
existing valuation allowances are due to remaining uncertainties related to our ability to utilize other net operating loss carryforwards of certain foreign subsidiaries 
in the future  if enough evidence of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in these foreign jurisdictions becomes apparent  we would be required to reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in income tax expense in the consolidated statement of income 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the likelihood that we will realize the deferred tax assets and adjusts the valuation allowances  if appropriate 
accounting for contingencies from time to time  we are named as a defendant in legal actions arising from our normal business activities 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires management to use its best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued in our consolidated financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 

table of contents results of operations as a percentage of net sales the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of our net sales represented by certain income statement data and the change in certain income statement data from period to period 
this table should be read in conjunction with the discussion that follows fiscal year ended january  net sales cost of sales  including certain buying  distribution and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income other income other expenses income before income taxes income tax expense net income period over period change net sales gross profit income from operations net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased by to billion  from billion in the prior fiscal year

these obligations and commitments will have an impact on future liquidity and the availability of capital resources 
accumulated cash and future cash from operations  as well as available credit under our line of credit facility  are expected to fund such obligations and commitments

sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value and requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
could have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating what impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no

in september  the sec staff published staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements  specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after november  sab did not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified its consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be 
table of contents presented in the income statement 
eitf addresses what type of government assessments should be included within the scope of eitf  and how such government assessments should be presented in the income statement 
the eitf concluded that the scope of eitf includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
in addition the eitf also concluded that the presentation of taxes  within the scope of eitf  on either a gross or net basis  is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 disclosure of accounting policies 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  a company should disclose the amounts of those taxes in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant 
the eitf observed that because eitf requires only the presentation of additional disclosures  an entity would not be required to re evaluate its existing policies related to taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer 
eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we will adopt the disclosure requirements of eitf effective february   however  since we present revenue on a net basis  no further disclosure under eitf will be required 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new standard also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of fin is expected to result in adjustments to our tax contingency reserves and deferred income taxes which could be material  with an offsetting adjustment to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year we have not completed our evaluation of fin nor measured its impact on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the following types of market risks fluctuations in the purchase price of merchandise  as well as other goods and services  the value of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar  and changes in interest rates 
due to the company s inventory turnover rate and its historical ability to pass through the impact of any generalized changes in its cost of goods to its customers through pricing adjustments  commodity and other product risks are not expected to be material 
the company purchases substantially all of its merchandise in us dollars  including a portion of the goods for its stores located in canada and europe 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
as of january  and  the company s cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities consisted primarily of funds invested in tax exempt municipal bonds rated aa or better  auction rate securities rated aa or better and money market accounts  which bear interest at a variable rate 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of the company s investment portfolio  we believe a basis point change in interest rates would not 
table of contents have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
as the interest rates on a material portion of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are variable  a change in interest rates earned on the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would impact interest income along with cash flows  but would not impact the fair market value of the related underlying instruments
