our solutions are designed to offer a flexible  comprehensive it solution that meets the specific business and infrastructure needs of our customers 
our suite of products can be purchased on an individual basis  in various combinations  as part of a total or partial outsourcing arrangement  or on a utility  or on demand  basis 
our point solutions meet the specific needs of customers who require control of their physical assets  while our utility solution provides customers with on demand access to our services and infrastructure without the upfront capital costs 
by outsourcing significant elements of their network and it infrastructure needs  our customers are able to focus on their core business while we ensure the performance of their it infrastructure 
we have approximately  customers across all industries with a particular emphasis in the financial services  media and entertainment  retail and the us federal government sectors 
our services our primary products and services include the following i hosting services  ii managed internet protocol virtual private network  or managed ip vpn  services  iii other network services  and iv digital content services 
hosting services provide the core facilities and network infrastructure to run business applications and provide data storage and redundancy services 
our hosting services are comprised of colocation  managed hosting  utility computing  and professional services  which allow our customers to choose the amount of it infrastructure they prefer to outsource to support their business applications 
customers can scale their usage of our services as their own requirements grow and as the benefits of outsourcing it infrastructure management become more apparent 
colocation is designed for customers seeking data center space and power for their server and networking equipment needs 
we manage data centers located in the united states  europe and asia with approximately million square feet of gross raised floor space  providing our customers around the world with easy access to their equipment 
our colocation services are priced based on the power and space needs of our customers and market conditions at the time contracts are executed 
we believe that our historical contracted prices are below market for some of our occupied colocation space  providing us with an opportunity to increase our hosting revenue from colocation services while only marginally increasing our related expenses 
customers who choose not to pay the higher  market rates for colocation may move out of our data centers  freeing space for customers willing to pay market rates or choosing our managed hosting or utility computing services 
managed hosting services provide an outsourced solution for a customer s server and network equipment needs 
in providing our managed hosting services  we deploy industry standard hardware and software platforms which are installed in our data centers to deliver the services necessary for running our customers applications 
we provide our managed hosting services  including all the technology and operations support  on a monthly fee basis 
this allows our customers to benefit from a secure infrastructure without incurring the capital expense and ongoing operations  personnel and systems costs of owning and managing their own infrastructure 
utility computing provides customers with an applications platform that delivers on demand scalability of an entire range of it infrastructure at lower total cost than found with traditional service provider models 
we achieve this combination of lower cost and better service through the use of virtualization technology 
whereas it infrastructure services have traditionally been provided by discrete hardware components  advances in virtualization technology and software have enabled us to provide a broad range of functionality without the challenges of implementing and managing discrete components 
not only does this enable us to improve our own asset utilization  it also results in our ability to dynamically configure services to meet customer requirements with a utility model 
through our managed network  we provide connectivity between the customer and the utility computing platform housed in our data centers 
this connectivity allows customers to purchase from us the application  storage  security and other services they require on an on demand basis 
with our utility computing solution  our customers pay only for the services they currently need  while maintaining the ability to scale up or down to meet their changing business needs

digital content services is a managed infrastructure specifically optimized for the creation  production  and distribution of digital content 
these services help customers manage  share  store  and distribute their digital content 
on january   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets related to our digital content services to level the assets we sold to level were primarily assets that we used to provide streaming and caching services 
we continue to provide managed infrastructure for the creation  production  and distribution of digital content under our wam net trademark and we continue to act as a reseller of certain services that we sold to level business trends our financial results continue to be affected by competition in our industry 
we expect competitive factors in our industry to continue to affect the prices for our services and our results of operations 
price pressures vary by product and service 
prices for certain telecommunications services that we offer have decreased over the past several years 
while we may continue to see decreases for some of these telecommunications services due to continued consolidation in the telecommunications industry  there has been some stabilization and some increases in pricing of other services that we offer 
for example  pricing for our hosting colocation services has increased and is expected to continue to increase in certain markets where there is a shortage of high grade data center space 
due to the disparity in pricing  growth  and profitability of our products and services  we continue to evaluate our operating structure and focus 
we continue to explore strategic options for those services which have experienced relatively slow growth in the past  and instead focus on our hosting and managed ip vpn services  which have experienced steady growth over the past year 
to that end  on december   we entered into a purchase agreement  or the purchase agreement  to sell substantially all of the assets related to our content delivery network  or cdn assets  to level additionally  on december   we announced plans to develop four new data centers  with the intention of opening them in the fourth quarter of in total  upon completion  the four new data centers will add approximately  square feet of gross raised floor space 
funding for the development of the four new data centers will come from the sale of the cdn assets  available cash and debt capacity 
we are also planning a million investment to upgrade our network in in evaluating our financial results and the performance of our business  our management reviews our revenues  gross profit  gross margin  and income loss from operations 
in addition  management evaluates these indicators on a quarterly and annual basis in order to have a complete understanding of business trends 
the following table presents a quarterly overview of these indicators for the periods indicated in thousands quarters ended years ended march  june  september  december  december  december  revenue gross profit gross margin income loss from operations excludes depreciation  amortization  and accretion expense which are reported separately 

table of contents revenue our revenue grew by during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by a million increase in our hosting revenue  with additional increases in managed ip vpn of million 
these increases were partially offset by revenue declines from other network services of million and reuters revenue of million 
for the fourth quarter of  our revenue increased sequentially compared to the third quarter of this was due primarily to increases in revenue from hosting of million and other network services of million  partially offset by minor declines in reuters revenue of million and digital content services of million 
managed ip vpn revenue was relatively flat compared to the third quarter of we expect revenue from reuters and digital content services will continue to decline in  with an approximate decrease of million in digital content services revenue due to the sale of the cdn assets 
together  reuters limited and telerate  which was acquired by reuters in  or reuters  accounted for and of total revenue for the three months and year ended december   respectively  and and for the three months and year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced pricing for certain services that we provide  based on the terms of a three year master services agreement that we entered into with reuters in may  and the reduction of services purchased by reuters under our telerate contract 
we anticipate that revenue from the telerate contract will continue to decline over the next six months to almost zero as reuters begins moving telerate customers from under our contract 
we believe we can partially offset this decrease by increasing our revenue from new and existing customers through a number of initiatives including continuing the strong growth of our managed service offerings by attracting new customers  and moving existing customers from non managed to our more profitable managed services  capitalizing on the current shortage of colocation space by replacing existing contracts  which were set when the price for colocation services was low  as they expire with market rate contracts  and improving the productivity of our direct sales force by increasing sales force automation and providing more sales support with engineering and product expertise and exploring opportunities to sell additional services to existing customers  including reuters

the lease agreement imposes certain obligations on us and grants certain rights to the landlord in the event we default on the lease 
the lease agreement contains other customary representations  warranties  obligations  conditions  indemnification provisions and termination provisions associated with leases of this nature 
as a result of the renewal provisions in the lease agreement that are indicative of continuing involvement by us  the lease qualifies as a financing method lease rather than a sale under sale leaseback accounting for real estate 
accordingly  we recorded a financing method lease obligation of million  equal to the proceeds received 
the related assets and financing method lease obligation will be reflected in our consolidated balance sheet until completion of the lease term in june  when they will be removed from our financial statements  and any remaining obligation will be recognized as a gain on sale of the facility and equipment 
future minimum lease payments due under the financing method lease obligation  as of december   were million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter  all of which represent interest using the effective interest method 
debt covenants the provisions of our debt and leasing agreements contain a number of covenants that could limit or restrict our ability to incur more debt  pay dividends  and repurchase stock  subject to financial measures and other conditions 
the ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our debt and leasing agreements and could trigger acceleration of repayment 
as of and during the years ended december    and  we were in compliance with all covenants under the debt and leasing agreements  as applicable 
equity transactions stock options

compensation expense associated with stock options was million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
our expense includes million associated with the modification of a term of a former executive s stock option agreement in march reverse stock split

in connection with the reverse stock split  each fifteen shares of our issued and outstanding common stock were combined into one share of our common stock 
stockholders received cash in lieu of any fraction of a share that they would have otherwise been entitled to receive as a result of the reverse stock split 
in addition  all exercise and conversion prices and the number of shares of our common stock  preferred stock  warrants  stock options and other equity awards presented herein for current and prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the reverse stock split 

table of contents preferred stock 
on may   we entered into an exchange and recapitalization agreement  or the exchange agreement  with the holders of our series a convertible preferred stock  or the series a preferred  pursuant to which the holders agreed to exchange  or the exchange  their shares of series a preferred for an aggregate of million shares of our common stock  including million common shares in addition to the shares of common stock the series a preferred was then convertible into in accordance with their terms 
on june   pursuant to the exchange agreement  all such common shares were issued to the holders of the series a preferred  in exchange for all shares of series a preferred 
in connection with the exchange  we recognized a deemed dividend on the series a preferred of million  representing the difference between the fair market value of the shares issued in the exchange and those convertible pursuant to the original conversion terms 
the deemed dividend is included in the computation of net loss attributable to common stockholders in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  investment funds related to welsh  carson  anderson stowe  or wcas  held approximately of the outstanding series a preferred 
three members of our board of directors are general partners of certain wcas funds  represent wcas on our board of directors and owned shares of series a preferred and participated in the exchange

constellation s representative on our board of directors resigned effective july  two of our executive officers hold restricted preferred units  or rpus  that entitled them to receive upon vesting of each rpu that number of shares of common stock that a holder of series a preferred would have been entitled to receive 
accordingly  their rpus were adjusted to give them the same benefits they would have received had they held series a preferred and participated in the exchange 
the exchange was approved by a special committee of our board of directors comprised of independent directors who were advised by independent  third party financial advisors and legal counsel 
the exchange was also approved by our stockholders acting by written consent 
wcas  constellation and mlt  who collectively held more than a majority of our outstanding voting power  executed the written consent 
restricted preferred units 
on may   the compensation committee of our board of directors awarded  rpus to two of our executives  giving the holders the right to receive upon vesting that number of shares of common stock as one share of our series a preferred would have been convertible into had such shares of series a preferred been outstanding since march   less an exercise value of  per rpu 
based on the terms of the exchange previously described  the rpus were adjusted to give the holders the same benefits they would have received had they participated in the exchange  resulting in the holders obtaining the right to receive upon vesting million shares of common stock 
rpus allow for a cashless exercise  net of shares withheld for estimated taxes  which may result in fewer shares issued than were originally granted 
compensation expense associated with the rpus was measured on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and was determined to be million and will be recognized over the four year vesting period 
vesting is subject to continued employment and occurs at a rate of on each anniversary of the grant date until fully vested 
compensation expense associated with rpus was million during the year ended december  warrants 
in  we issued warrants to nortel networks  inc  or nortel  to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock for per share 
in march  nortel exercised its warrants and received approximately million shares of our common stock 
additionally in  we issued ten million five year performance warrants to entities affiliated with constellation ventures  or constellation  to acquire shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants vested in a total of three tranches as constellation earned the right to exercise the warrants when it met certain performance criteria related to assisting us in obtaining new business 
during the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of  and the second quarter of  respectively  constellation met the performance criteria  causing each of the three tranches for an aggregate of million warrants to vest  which resulted in non cash equity based compensation expense of million  million  and million  with respect to each of the three tranches 
the non cash equity based compensation expense was calculated utilizing the black scholes option pricing model and relevant assumptions 
in the first quarter of  constellation completed a cashless exercise of its first tranche of vested warrants and received approximately million shares of our common stock 
in august  constellation completed an additional cashless exercise of its remaining warrants and received approximately million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had no outstanding warrants 
restricted stock units 
in august  our compensation committee awarded restricted common stock units  or rsus  to our executives and employees  governed by the terms of the plan 
rsus represent common stock but do not give the recipient any actual ownership interest in our common stock  other than the right to receive cash dividends  until vested and the shares of common stock underlying the rsus are delivered 
we received no cash consideration for such awards 
vesting of the rsus is subject to continued employment over a period of up to four years 
in the event of our achievement of annual financial performance targets  beginning in march  one third of the rsu s will vest annually through march we awarded million and million rsus in the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million and million were forfeited upon employment termination in the years ended december  and  respectively 
rsus allow for a cashless exercise  net of shares withheld for estimated taxes  which may result in fewer shares issued than were originally granted 
the approximate grant date fair value was million and million for awards granted in and  respectively  and was recorded as deferred compensation 
deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight line basis and recognized as non cash equity based compensation over the expected performance period 
compensation expense related to the rsus was million and 
table of contents million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
if we achieve certain performance targets  non cash equity based compensation will be accelerated to ensure that the amount of non cash equity based compensation recorded is reflective of the vested rsus 
restricted common stock 
in february  our board of directors awarded less than million shares of restricted common stock  or rcs  governed by the terms of the plan 
the related rcs agreements provide for the issuance of non vested rcs to certain non employee members of our board of directors 
rcs issued under the plan vest ratably on the anniversary of the grant date over a period of three years based on the recipient s continued service to us 
rcs provide the recipient on the grant date with actual ownership interests in our common stock  including voting rights and the right to receive dividends 
we recorded million of deferred compensation in conjunction with the grant of the rcs  which represented the fair value of the rcs on the date of grant 
deferred compensation is being amortized on a straight line basis and recognized as non cash equity based compensation over the three year vesting period and was million and less than million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
secondary stock offering 
on january   mlt llc  which owned  or  of the outstanding shares of our common stock at december   sold all such shares under our existing shelf registration statement 
we did not receive any of the proceeds of the offering 
commitments and contingencies our customer contracts generally span multiple periods  which result in us entering into arrangements with various suppliers of communications services that require us to maintain minimum spending levels  some of which increase over time  to secure favorable pricing terms 
our remaining aggregate minimum spending levels  allocated ratably over the terms of such contracts  are million  million  million  million  and million during the years ended december     and  and thereafter  respectively 
should we not meet the minimum spending levels in any given term  decreasing termination liabilities  representing a percentage of the remaining contracted amount  may become immediately due and payable 
furthermore  certain of these termination liabilities are subject to reduction should we experience the loss of a major customer or suffer a loss of revenue from a general economic downturn 
before considering the effects of any potential reductions for the business downturn provisions  if we had terminated all of these agreements as of december   the maximum liability would have been million 
to mitigate this exposure  when possible  we align our minimum spending commitments with customer revenue commitments for related services 
in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  such as letters of credit  indemnifications  and numerous operating leases under which the majority of our facilities are leased 
the agreements associated with such guarantees and financial instruments mature at various dates through december and may be renewed as circumstances warrant 
our financial instruments are valued based on the amount of exposure under the instruments and the likelihood of performance being required 
based on our past experience  no claims have been made against these financial instruments nor do we expect the exposure to material losses resulting therefrom to be anything other than remote 
as a result  we determined such financial instruments did not have significant value and have not recorded any related amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit pledged as collateral to support various property and equipment leases and utilities 
in addition  certain of the operating leases assumed by us in the cwa asset acquisition continue to be collateralized by cable wireless plc with letters of credit and guarantees totaling million  which will be replaced by us by july also  in connection with our sale of the assets related to our digital content services  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser for certain losses that it may incur due to a breach of our representations and warranties 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and other actions arising in the normal course of business 
while the results of such proceedings and actions cannot be predicted  we believe  based on facts known to management today  that the ultimate outcome of such proceedings and actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have employment agreements with key executive officers that contain provisions with regard to base salary  bonus  equity based compensation  and other employee benefits 
these agreements also provide for severance benefits in the event of employment termination or a change in control

critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations and financial position 
for a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
note that our preparation of this annual report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from recurring revenue streams  consisting primarily of hosting  managed ip vpn  other network services  and digital content services  which is recognized as services are provided 
installation fees  although generally billed upon installation  are deferred and recognized ratably over the estimated average life of a customer contract 
revenue is recognized only when the related service has been provided  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our individual customer contracts  we have service level commitments with certain of our customers  including some that are among the largest global companies 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  or are otherwise disputed due to third party power or service issues  unfavorable weather  or other service interruptions or conditions  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
allowance for credits and uncollectibles as described above  we have service level commitments with certain of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued  based on historical credits issued and known disputes  and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including customer payment history and creditworthiness 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers although in certain cases we may obtain a security deposit 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowances  we maintain an allowance for uncollectibles and specifically analyze accounts receivable  current economic conditions and trends  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  and changes in customer payment terms 
delinquent account balances are written off after we have determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 

table of contents cost of revenue invoices from communications service providers may exceed amounts we believe that we owe 
our practice is to identify these variances and engage in discussions with the vendors to resolve disputes 
accruals are maintained for the best estimate of the amount that will ultimately be paid 
variations in our estimates and ultimate settlement of vendor billings may have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
other operational expenses include rental costs  utilities  costs for hosting space  as well as salaries and related benefits for engineering  service delivery and provisioning  customer service  and operations personnel 
maintenance and operations costs for irus are also reflected in cost of revenue 
equity based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost recognized in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  includes a compensation cost for all equity based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all equity based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in order to comply with the fair value provisions of sfas r  we estimate the fair value of equity based instruments using the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes valuation model requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates including the volatility of our stock  risk free interest rate  the expected life of the award  and dividend yield 
expected volatility is determined based on historical stock volatility over the expected term of the award 
the risk free interest rate is determined using an interest rate yield on us treasury instruments with a term equivalent to the award at the date of grant 
the expected option life is the calculated term of options based on historical employee exercise patterns experienced for similar award grants 
the dividend yield is assumed to be zero based on our intent to not declare dividends in the foreseeable future 
a change in any of these estimates or assumptions could result in a material impact  either positive or negative  to our consolidated financial statements 
results for prior periods have not been restated for the adoption of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for equity based awards using the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
as such  we only recognized compensation cost for equity based awards to the extent awards were issued with an exercise price below the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
in december  prior to the adoption of sfas r  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved the acceleration of vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share previously awarded to employees  including certain executive officers and non employee directors 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of december  options to purchase approximately million shares of common stock  including approximately million options held by executive officers and approximately million options held by non employee directors  were subject to the acceleration  which resulted in of our then outstanding options being vested 
the purpose of the acceleration was to enable us to minimize the amount of compensation expense recognized in association with these options in its consolidated statements of operations upon adoption of sfas r 
management believes that the aggregate future expense that was eliminated as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of these options was approximately million 
management also believed that because the options that were accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the market value of our common stock on the date of acceleration  the options had limited economic value and were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method  which provides for the establishment of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax purposes  applying the enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on deferred tax assets arising primarily from tax loss carryforwards and other potential tax benefits according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  because the future realization of such benefit is uncertain 
as a result  to the extent that those benefits are realized in future periods  they will favorably affect net income or loss 
as of december   we had million in net operating loss carryforwards scheduled to expire between and  of which million is subject to the section limitation of the internal revenue code  which limits the amount of net operating losses that we may deduct for income tax purposes 
in  we recorded an income tax provision of million for us and state alternative minimum taxes 

table of contents intangible assets our identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships  trademarks  patents  and peering agreements  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives of these intangible assets are three to four years for customer relationships  four years for trademarks  eleven to fifteen years for patents  and seven years for peering agreements 
as of december  and  we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million and million  respectively 
valuation of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable  a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
fair value is measured based on a discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management 
the estimates of cash flows and discount rate are subject to change due to the economic environment  including such factors as interest rates  expected market returns and volatility of markets served 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates could result in impairment charges 
we had no asset impairment charges during the years ended december    or recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin is effective for annual periods beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of fin will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value techniques to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also provides for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  and cash flows
