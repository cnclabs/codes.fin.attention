item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in deepwater drilling with a fleet of offshore drilling rigs 
our fleet currently consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and one drillship 
in addition  we have two jack up drilling units on order at shipyards in brownsville  texas and singapore 
we expect both of these units to be delivered during the first quarter of overview industry conditions worldwide demand for our mid water intermediate and deepwater high specification semisubmersible rigs and international jack up rigs remained strong during the fourth quarter of however  the jack up market in the gom continues to experience downward pricing pressure  with the potential for a given rig to be ready stacked for a period of time between wells 
as of january   we had one ready stacked jack up unit 
exclusive of the gom jack up market  which accounted for percent of our total revenue for the quarter ended december   solid fundamental market conditions remain in place for all classes of offshore drilling rigs worldwide  and both dayrates and term contract opportunities have continued to slowly increase 
gulf of mexico 
in the gom  the market for our semisubmersible equipment remains firm 
the dayrate on one of our seven high specification floaters in the gom  for which we have received a letter of intent  or loi  is as high as  for future work 
however  the pace of contracting for these rigs has slowed due to the backlog of our existing agreements  all of which extend into or  except for the most recent agreement which extends into dayrates for our five intermediate semisubmersibles currently located in the gom are as high as  for a current one well contract and a future three well contract 
we continue to view the deepwater and intermediate markets in the gom as under supplied and believe that the gom semisubmersible market will remain strong in our jack up fleet in the gom experienced somewhat lower utilization during the fourth quarter of  coupled with increasing downward pressure on dayrates  compared to the third quarter of this situation began in the second quarter of we believe that the current pricing pressure on jack up rigs in the gom will extend at least until the second quarter of we expect two of our intermediate semisubmersibles  the ocean new era and ocean voyager  to mobilize from the gom to the mexican gom in the third quarter of under approximately year contracts both ending in early the rigs have commitments at dayrates of  and  respectively 
the terms of our drilling contracts with pemex for these rigs expose us to greater risks than we normally assume  such as exposure to increased environmental liability 
in addition  each contract can be terminated by pemex on short term notice  contractually or by statute  subject to certain conditions  although we view this eventuality as unlikely 
we expect the market for the mexican gom to remain strong in brazil 
two of our rigs operating in brazil are currently working under term contracts with petrobras that expire in  and two additional rigs are operating under contracts expiring in petrobras is continuing to seek additional intermediate semisubmersible rigs  and we expect the brazilian semisubmersible demand to remain strong in north sea 
effective industry utilization remains at percent in the north sea where we have three intermediate semisubmersible rigs in the uk and one intermediate unit in norway 
indicating the strength of this market  one of our four rigs in the north sea recently received a term contract extending until the second quarter of  with an option until late march to convert to a two year contract ending in the other three rigs have term contracts that extend into australia asia middle east mediterranean 
we currently have five semisubmersible rigs and one jack up unit operating in the australia asia market  and two jack up rigs and one intermediate floater operating in the middle 
table of contents east mediterranean sector 
all nine of these rigs are operating under contracts for work extending into  or during the third quarter of  one of our new build jack up rigs  the ocean shield  which is currently under construction in singapore  received a one year term contract at a dayrate of  with the option until late march to convert to a two year contract  but at a slightly lower dayrate 
under the agreement  the rig is scheduled to begin work offshore australia upon completion of construction and commissioning of the rig  which is estimated to occur in the first quarter of we believe that the australia asia and middle east mediterranean markets will remain strong in contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and reflects both firm commitments typically represented by signed contracts  as well as lois 
an loi is subject to customary conditions  including the execution of a definitive agreement 
contract drilling backlog is based on the full contractual dayrate for our drilling rigs and is calculated assuming full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period 
the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  unscheduled repairs  maintenance and weather 
our contract backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period  excluding revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods is a function of both the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts 
february  february  in thousands contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles gom jack ups including offshore mexico international jack ups total the following table reflects the amount of our contract drilling backlog by year as of february  for the years ending december  total in thousands contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles gom jack ups including offshore mexico international jack ups total includes an aggregate billion in contract drilling revenue of which approximately million  million and million is expected to be earned during  and between and  respectively  relating to expected future work under lois 

table of contents the following table reflects the percentage of rig days committed by year as of february  the percentage of rig days committed is calculated as the ratio of total days committed under contracts and lois and scheduled shipyard and survey days for all rigs in our fleet to total available days number of rigs multiplied by the number of days in a particular year 
total available days have been calculated based on the expected delivery dates for the ocean endeavor  ocean monarch  and our two newbuild jack up rigs  the ocean scepter and ocean shield 
for the years ending december  contract drilling backlog high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles gom jack ups including offshore mexico international jack ups impact of hurricanes in the third quarter of  two major hurricanes  katrina and rita  struck the us gulf coast and gulf of mexico 
in late august  one of our jack up drilling rigs  the ocean warwick  was seriously damaged during hurricane katrina and other rigs in our fleet  as well as our warehouse in new iberia  louisiana  sustained lesser damage in hurricane katrina or rita  or both storms 
we believe that the physical damage to our rigs  as well as related removal and recovery costs  are primarily covered by insurance  after applicable deductibles 
at december   we had filed several insurance claims related to the storms which are currently under review by insurance adjusters or are pending underwriter approval 
our results for  and to a lesser extent  reflect the impact of hurricanes katrina and rita 
the ocean warwick  with a net book value of million  was declared a constructive total loss effective august  we issued a proof of loss in the amount of million to our insurers  representing the insured value of the rig less a million deductible 
we received all insurance proceeds related to this claim in recovery and removal of the ocean warwick are subject to separate insurance deductibles which were estimated at the time of loss to be million in the aggregate 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a net million casualty gain for the ocean warwick  representing net insurance proceeds of million  less the write off of the million net carrying value of the drilling rig and million in rig based spare parts and supplies  and estimated insurance deductibles aggregating million for salvage and wreck removal 
we have presented this as casualty gain on ocean warwick in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
during  we subsequently revised our estimate of expected deductibles related to salvage and wreck removal of the ocean warwick to million and recorded a million adjustment to casualty gain on ocean warwick in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
damage to our other affected rigs and warehouse was less severe 
at the time of loss  we estimated insurance deductibles related to the remaining rigs damaged during hurricane katrina and our rigs and facility damaged by hurricane rita to total million in the aggregate  of which million and million were recorded as additional contract drilling expense and loss on disposition of assets  respectively  for the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
subsequently  during  we revised our estimate of the applicable deductibles related to these damages and recorded a million gain on disposition of assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
in addition  in the third quarter of and during  we wrote off the aggregate net book value of approximately million in rig equipment that was either lost or damaged beyond repair during these storms as loss on disposition of assets and recorded a corresponding insurance receivable in an amount equal to our expected recovery from insurers 
the write off of this equipment and recognition of insurance receivables had no net effect on our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december  and during the third and fourth quarters of  we incurred additional operating expenses  including but not limited to the cost of rig crew over time and employee assistance  hurricane relief supplies  temporary housing and office space and the rental of mooring equipment  of million relating to relief and recovery efforts in the aftermath of hurricanes katrina and rita  which we do not expect to be recoverable through our insurance 
in late we received million from certain of our customers primarily related to the replacement or repair of equipment damaged during the hurricanes 
we recorded million of this recovery as a credit to 
table of contents contract drilling expense  million as a gain on disposition of assets and the remaining million as other income in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
general our revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
the two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs  and vice versa 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive lump sum fees for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization fees received  as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs 
we defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 
operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements  inflation and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
we have experienced and continue to experience upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the strengthening offshore drilling market and increased competition for skilled workers 
in response to these market conditions we have implemented retention programs  including increases in compensation 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by short term fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state 
table of contents with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
periods of high  sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper  working order 
in addition  during periods of high activity and dayrates  higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses  which cause our costs for goods and services to increase 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time 
during  we expect to spend an aggregate of approximately million for year surveys and intermediate surveys  including estimated mobilization costs  but excluding any resulting repair and maintenance costs  which could be significant 
costs of mobilizing our rigs to shipyards for scheduled surveys  which were a major component of our survey related costs during  are indicative of higher prices commanded by support businesses to the offshore drilling industry 
we expect mobilization costs to be a significant component of our survey related costs in when we renewed our principal insurance policies effective may   coverage for offshore drilling rigs  if available  was offered at substantially higher premiums than in the past and was subject to an increasing number of coverage limitations  due in part to underwriting losses suffered by the insurance industry as a result of damage caused by hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in and in some cases  quoted renewal premiums increased by more than  with the addition of substantial deductibles and limits on the amount of claims payable for losses arising from named windstorms 
in light of these factors  we determined that retention of additional risk was preferable to paying dramatically higher premiums for limited coverage 
accordingly  we have elected to self insure for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
for our other physical damage coverage  our deductible is million per occurrence or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss 
as a result of our reduced coverage  our premiums for this coverage were reduced from the amounts we paid in and were lower than the renewal rates quoted by our insurance carriers 
we also renewed our liability policies in may  with an increase in premiums and deductibles 
our new deductibles under these policies have generally increased to million per occurrence  but our deductibles arising in connection with certain liabilities relating to named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico have increased to million per occurrence  with no annual aggregate deductible 
in addition  we elected to self insure a portion of our excess liability coverage related to named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico 
to the extent that we incur certain liabilities related to named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico in excess of million  we are self insured for up to a maximum retention of million per occurrence in addition to these deductibles 
we are currently in the early stages of renewing our insurance policies that expire on may  currently we are unable to predict what changes  if any  we may make to our insurance coverage on or after may  
table of contents if named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico cause significant damage to our rigs or equipment or to the property of others for which we may be liable  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
insurance premiums will be amortized as expense over the applicable policy periods which generally expire at the end of april construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 capitalization of interest cost  or sfas during and  we began capitalizing interest on our two capital upgrade projects and the construction of our two new jack up rigs 
pursuant to sfas  the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
in we began capitalizing interest on expenditures related to the capital upgrade of the ocean monarch and the construction of our two jack up rigs  and in  we began capitalizing interest on expenditures related to the upgrade of the ocean endeavor 
see note general information capitalized interest to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
as of december   the shipyard portion of the ocean endeavor s upgrade had been completed  and the rig is currently undergoing sea trials and commissioning in singapore 
we will continue to capitalize interest costs related to this upgrade until sea trials and commissioning are completed and the rig is loaded out on a heavy lift vessel for its return to the gom  which we anticipate will occur at the end of the first quarter of we believe that this point in time represents the completion of the construction phase of the upgrade project  as the newly upgraded rig will be ready for its intended use 
accordingly  we will then cease capitalizing interest costs related to this upgrade and will begin depreciating the newly upgraded rig 
as a result of the scheduled delivery of the ocean endeavor  we anticipate that depreciation and interest expense in will increase by approximately million representing nine months of expense and million  respectively 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
our management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked  and salvage value for each rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
we also consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant  or alternatively the impact of a reduction in utilization again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant as part of our analysis 

table of contents as of december   all of our drilling rigs were either under contract  in shipyards for surveys and or life extension projects or undergoing a major upgrade 
based on this knowledge  we determined that an impairment test of our drilling equipment was not needed as we are currently marketing all of our drilling units 
we did not have any cold stacked rigs at december  we do not believe that current circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 
management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
effective may   in conjunction with our insurance policy renewals  we increased our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  to million per occurrence  with no aggregate deductible 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
prior to this renewal  our uninsured retention of liability for personal injury claims was million per claim with an additional aggregate annual deductible of million 
our in house claims department estimates the amount of our liability for our retention 
this department establishes a reserve for each of our personal injury claims by evaluating the existing facts and circumstances of each claim and comparing the circumstances of each claim to historical experiences with similar past personal injury claims 
our claims department also estimates our liability for personal injuries that are incurred but not reported by using historical data 
from time to time  we may also engage experts to assist us in estimating our reserve for such personal injury claims 
in we engaged an actuary to estimate our liability for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
we reduced our reserve for personal injury claims by million during the fourth quarter of based on an actuarial review from which we determined that our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims should be million at december  the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
for interim periods  we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax  taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
during we were able to utilize all of the foreign tax credits available to us and we had no foreign tax credit carryforwards as of december  at the end of  we had a valuation allowance of million for certain of our foreign tax credit carryforwards which was reversed during as the valuation allowance was no longer necessary 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold 
table of contents and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the guidance provided in fin and expect to adopt fin in the first quarter of although our assessment has not yet been finalized  upon adoption of fin we expect to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment for uncertain tax positions of approximately million  which will be charged to results of operations and equity 
results of operations years ended december  and comparative data relating to our revenues and operating expenses by equipment type are presented below 
we have reclassified certain amounts applicable to the prior periods to conform to the classifications we currently follow 
these reclassifications do not affect earnings 
year ended december  favorable unfavorable in thousands contract drilling revenue high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups other total contract drilling revenue revenues related to reimbursable expenses contract drilling expense high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups other total contract drilling expense reimbursable expenses operating income high specification floaters intermediate semisubmersibles jack ups other reimbursables  net depreciation general and administrative expense loss gain on sale and disposition of assets casualty gain on ocean warwick total operating income continued strong demand for our rigs in all markets and geographic regions resulted in high utilization and historically high dayrates during due to this continuing strong demand  our operating income in increased million  or  to million  compared to million in dayrates have generally increased during  compared to  resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues by our fleet 
however  overall revenue increases were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with mandatory surveys and related repair time and lower dayrates earned by some of our semisubmersible rigs due to 
table of contents previously established job sequencing that caused the units to temporarily roll to older contracts with lower dayrates 
total contract drilling revenues in increased million  or  to  million compared to our results in were also impacted by higher expenses related to our mooring enhancement and other hurricane preparedness activities  wage increases in late and the first quarter of and surveys performed during the increase in survey costs included higher expenses for survey related services and higher boat charges associated with moving rigs to and from shipyards 
in addition  overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between and reflect the impact of high  sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet and in all geographic locations in which we operate 
the increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses 
total contract drilling expenses in increased million  or  to million  compared to the same period in the increase in our operating expenses in  as compared to  was partially offset by an million reduction in our reserve for personal injury claims based on an actuarial review 
our operating results in included a million casualty gain due to the constructive total loss of the ocean warwick as a result of hurricane katrina in august and an million gain related to the june sale of the ocean liberator

year ended december  favorable unfavorable in thousands contract drilling revenue gom australia asia middle east south america total contract drilling revenue contract drilling expense gom australia asia middle east south america total contract drilling expense operating income gom 
revenues generated by our high specification floaters operating in the gom increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher average dayrates earned during the period and revenues generated by the ocean baroness  which relocated to the gom from the australia asia market in the latter half of million 
excluding the ocean baroness  average operating revenue per day for our rigs in this market increased to  during  compared to  during  generating additional revenues of million 
the higher overall dayrates achieved for our high specification floaters reflect the continuing high demand for this class of rig in the gom 
average utilization for our high specification rigs operating in the gom  excluding the contribution from the ocean baroness  increased slightly to in compared to  and resulted in million in revenue 
operating costs during for our high specification floaters in the gom increased million over operating costs incurred during the increase in operating costs is primarily due to the inclusion of normal operating costs and amortization of mobilization expenses for the ocean baroness during million compared to the prior year when this drilling rig operated offshore indonesia 
in addition  our operating expenses for  compared to  reflect higher labor and benefits costs related to late and first quarter of wage increases  higher repair and maintenance costs  and higher miscellaneous operating expenses  including catering costs 
our operating expenses in reflect a million reduction in costs due to a recovery from a 
table of contents customer for damages sustained by one of our gom rigs during hurricane ivan in  partially offset by the recognition of million in deductibles for damages sustained during hurricane katrina in australia asia 
revenues generated by our high specification rigs in the australia asia middle east market decreased million in compared to  primarily due to the relocation of the ocean baroness from this market to the gom in the latter half of prior to its relocation to the gom  the ocean baroness generated million in revenues during the decrease in revenues in was partially offset by additional revenue million generated by an increase in the dayrate earned by the ocean rover compared to the prior year 
the average operating revenue per day for this rig increased from  in to  in as a result of a new drilling program which began in the second quarter of utilization improvements for the ocean rover during  as compared to when the unit had days of downtime for repairs  generated an additional million in revenues 
operating costs for our rigs in the australia asia middle east market decreased million in compared to primarily due to the relocation of the ocean baroness to the gom million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in operating costs for the ocean rover during  compared to the prior year  primarily related to higher personnel related costs as a result of late and march pay increases  increased agency fee costs which are based on a percentage of revenues and higher other miscellaneous operating expenses 
south america 
revenues for our high specification rigs operating offshore brazil increased million in compared to  primarily due to higher average dayrates earned by our rigs in this market million 
average operating revenue per day earned by the ocean alliance and the ocean clipper increased to  during up from  during the prior year as a result of contract renewals for both rigs in the latter part of utilization for our rigs offshore brazil increased from in to in  contributing million in additional revenues in  primarily due to less downtime during for repairs 
contract drilling expenses for our operations offshore brazil increased million in compared to the increase in costs is primarily due to higher labor  benefits and other personnel related costs as a result of and march pay increases and other compensation enhancement programs  increased agency fee costs which are based on a percentage of revenues  higher freight costs and higher maintenance and project costs

table of contents gom 
revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the gom during increased million over the prior year primarily due to higher average operating dayrates and the operation of the ocean new era million which was reactivated in december average operating dayrates for the remainder of our gom fleet of intermediate rigs increased from  in to  in and generated additional revenues of million during excluding the ocean new era  utilization fell from in to in  resulting in an million reduction in revenues generated in compared to average utilization in was negatively impacted by approximately five months of downtime for the ocean saratoga in connection with its survey and related repairs  as well as a life enhancement upgrade that commenced in the third quarter of and approximately one month of downtime for both the ocean voyager and ocean concord for mooring upgrades 
partially offsetting the decline in average utilization in was an improvement in utilization for the ocean lexington  which worked nearly all of prior to its move to egypt at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
during  the ocean lexington incurred over four months of downtime for a survey and life enhancement upgrade 
contract drilling expense for our gom operations increased million in compared to  primarily due to normal operating costs for the ocean new era in million and repair and other normal operating costs for the ocean whittington million in the latter half of after its return from the mexican gom 
higher operating costs in  as compared to  reflect higher labor and benefits costs as a result of september and march wage increases for our rig based personnel  mobilization costs associated with mooring upgrades for the ocean concord and ocean voyager  survey and related repair costs for the ocean saratoga and higher maintenance and other miscellaneous operating costs for our semisubmersible rigs in this market segment 
in addition  during  we incurred million in costs associated with the rental of mooring lines and chains as temporary replacements for equipment lost during the hurricanes in the gom 
partially offsetting the increased operating costs in was the absence of reactivation costs for the ocean new era  which returned to service in december mexican gom 
revenues generated by our intermediate semisubmersibles operating in the mexican gom during decreased million compared to  primarily due to pemex s early cancellation of its contract for the ocean whittington in july  partially offset by increased revenues for the ocean worker as a result of a small dayrate increase received in december our remaining three rigs in this market continue operating under contracts with pemex  two of which expire in mid and one that extends until late operating costs in the mexican gom increased million during compared to  primarily due to the effect of and march wage increases for our rig based personnel  as well as higher repair and maintenance costs  other miscellaneous operating costs and overheads  partially offset by lower operating costs for the ocean whittington pursuant to its third quarter relocation to the gom after termination of its drilling contract by pemex 
in addition  we incurred million in costs associated with the demobilization of the ocean whittington from offshore mexico to the gom 
australia asia 
our intermediate semisubmersible rigs operating in the australia asia market during generated an additional million in revenues compared to primarily due to higher average operating dayrates million 
average operating dayrates increased from  in to  in in addition  the over utilization of both the ocean epoch and ocean patriot during  as compared to when the average utilization for these two rigs was  contributed an additional million to revenues

loans under the credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to i the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or ii the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin  varying from to  based on our current credit ratings 
under our credit facility  we also pay  based on our current credit ratings  and as applicable  other customary fees  including  but not limited to  a facility fee on the total commitment under the credit facility regardless of usage and a utilization fee that applies if the aggregate of all loans outstanding under the credit facility equals or exceeds of the total commitment under the facility 
changes in credit ratings could lower or raise the fees that we pay under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains customary covenants  including  but not limited to  the maintenance of a ratio of consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization  as defined in the credit facility  of not more than at the end of each fiscal quarter and limitations on liens  mergers  consolidations  liquidation and dissolution  changes in lines of business  swap agreements  transactions with affiliates and subsidiary indebtedness 
based on our current credit ratings at december   the applicable margin on libor loans would have been 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
shelf registration 
we have the ability to issue an aggregate of approximately million in debt  equity and other securities under a shelf registration statement 
in addition  from time to time we may issue up to eight million shares of common stock which are registered under an acquisition shelf registration statement  after giving effect to the two for one stock split we declared in july  in connection with one or more acquisitions by us of securities or assets of other businesses 
liquidity and capital requirements our liquidity and capital requirements are primarily a function of our working capital needs  capital expenditures and debt service requirements 
we determine the amount of cash required to meet our capital commitments by evaluating the need to upgrade rigs to meet specific customer requirements and by evaluating our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  including water depth and drilling capability upgrades 
we believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet these capital commitments  however  we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes 
our ability to effect any such issuance will be dependent on our results of operations  our current financial condition  current market conditions and other 
table of contents factors beyond our control 
additionally  we may also make use of our credit facility to finance capital expenditures or for other general corporate purposes 
we believe that we have the financial resources needed to meet our business requirements in the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures for rig upgrades and enhancements  as well as our working capital requirements

credit ratings 
our current credit rating is baa for moody s investors services and a for standard poor s 
although our long term ratings continue at investment grade levels  lower ratings would result in higher rates for borrowings under our credit facility and could also result in higher interest rates on future debt issuances 
capital expenditures 
in  we began a major upgrade of the ocean monarch  a victory class semisubmersible that we acquired in august for million 
the modernized rig will be designed to operate in up to  feet of water in a moored configuration for an estimated cost of approximately million of which we had spent million through december  we expect to spend an additional million and million on this upgrade in and  respectively 
in addition  the shipyard portion of the upgrade of the ocean endeavor has been completed 
the newly upgraded rig is currently undergoing sea trials and commissioning 
the unit will remain in singapore until the arrival of a heavy lift vessel  anticipated late in the first quarter of  which will return the rig to the gom 
the ocean endeavor is expected to commence drilling operations in the gom in mid we estimate that the total cost of the upgrade will be approximately million of which million had been spent through december  we expect to spend the remaining million in in the second quarter of  we entered into agreements to construct two high performance  premium jack up rigs 
the two new drilling units  the ocean scepter and the ocean shield  are being constructed in brownsville  texas and singapore  respectively  at an aggregate expected cost of approximately million  including drill pipe and capitalized interest  of which million had been spent through december  each newbuild jack up rig will be equipped with a foot cantilever package  be capable of drilling depths of up to  feet and have a hook load capacity of two million pounds

delivery of both the ocean scepter and ocean shield are expected in the first quarter of we have budgeted approximately million in additional capital expenditures in associated with our ongoing rig equipment replacement and enhancement programs  and other corporate requirements 
we expect to finance our capital expenditures through the use of our existing cash balances or internally generated funds 
from time to time  however  we may also make use of our credit facility to finance capital expenditures 
during  we spent approximately million on our continuing rig capital maintenance program other than rig upgrades and new construction and to meet other corporate capital expenditure requirements

some of our subsidiaries conduct a portion of their operations in the local currency of the country where they conduct operations 
currency environments in which we have significant business operations include mexico  brazil  the uk  australia and malaysia 
when possible  we attempt to minimize our currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to our estimated operating costs payable in local currency with the balance of the contract payable in us dollars 
at present  however  only a limited number of our contracts are payable both in us dollars and the local currency 
we also utilize foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce our forward exchange risk 
a forward currency exchange contract obligates a contract holder to exchange predetermined amounts of specified foreign currencies at specified foreign exchange rates on specific dates 
we record currency translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses as other income expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
the effect on our results of operations from these translation adjustments and transaction gains and losses has not been material and are not expected to have a significant effect in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab requires a registrant to quantify the impact of correcting all misstatements on its current year financial statements using two approaches  the rollover and iron curtain approaches 
a registrant is required to adjust its current year financial statements if either approach to accumulate and identify misstatements results in quantifying a misstatement that is material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab is required to be considered for financial statements for fiscal years ending after november   however  earlier application of the guidance in sab to interim financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after november  is encouraged 
the adoption of sab had no impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

 accounting for defined benefit pension or other postretirement plans  or sfas sfas amends existing guidance to require balance sheet recognition of the funded status of defined benefit plans  recognition in other comprehensive income of various items before they are recognized in periodic benefit cost  the measurement date for plan assets and the benefit obligation to be the balance sheet date  and additional disclosures regarding the effects on periodic benefit cost for the following fiscal year arising from delayed recognition in the current period 
sfas also includes guidance regarding selection of assumed discount rates for use in measuring the benefit obligation 
sfas provides different effective dates for various aspects of the new rules 
for public companies  requirements to recognize the funded status of the plan and to comply with the disclosure provisions of sfas are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december   and the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date is effective for fiscal years ending after december  early adoption of sfas is encouraged and must be applied to all of an entity s benefit plans 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted the requirement to recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension plan  as well as the disclosure provisions

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which establishes a separate framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles in the us  or gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas was issued to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value and the limited guidance for applying those definitions in gaap that are dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  however  its adoption may result in changes to current practice 

table of contents changes resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  rather than an entity specific measurement 
it also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between i market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources and ii the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available under the circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   including interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including interim periods 
we are in the process of evaluating the impact  if any  of applying sfas on our financial statements  however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in june  the fasb issued fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the guidance provided in fin and expect to adopt fin in the first quarter of although our assessment has not yet been finalized  upon adoption of fin we expect to recognize a cumulative effect adjustment for uncertain tax positions of approximately million  which will be charged to results of operations and equity

see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements in item of this report 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
our long term debt  as of december  and december   is denominated in us dollars 
our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
during and  we entered into various foreign currency forward exchange contracts that required us to purchase predetermined amounts of foreign currencies at predetermined dates 
as of december   we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding  which aggregated million  that require us to purchase the equivalent of million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling  million in mexican pesos and million in norwegian kroner at various times through june at december   we had foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding  which aggregated million  that required us to purchase the equivalent of million in mexican pesos  the equivalent of million in australian dollars  the equivalent of million in british pounds sterling and the equivalent of million in brazilian reais at various times through march these forward exchange contracts were included in prepaid expenses and other in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and at fair value in accordance with sfas no
