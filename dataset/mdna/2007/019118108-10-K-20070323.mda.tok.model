trends in operations allied reported disappointing results for the company had a net loss of  or per share in as compared to a net loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting of  or per share in the losses in both years are largely attributable to the company s ammunition weapons effects awe segment 
the awe segment had revenues of  in as compared to  in  an increase of from the prior year 
this increase in revenues came from increases at both titan and mecar usa 
mecar concluded its approximately  foreign military sales fms contract in the first quarter of and experienced lower sales activity for the remainder of and all of mecar anticipated receiving a significant replenishment contract from its largest customer in but the contract was not received by year end

gms was acquired in november  and therefore  represents the first full year of its operations consolidated in the es segment 
gms revenues in were  gms incurred a net loss for  which included  of amortization expense stemming from the intangible assets that were recorded in conjunction with the acquisition 
we expect better performance for nsm and gms in  as the company looks to further expand their market presence and reduce operating expenses at nsm 
for both gms and nsm  is expected to be a better year than with improved results expected in the third and fourth quarters of for the other segment  seaspace s revenues increased as a result of increased revenue from antenna system sales and improved operating results from new management initiatives

allied concluded with a consolidated backlog of  compared with a consolidated backlog of  in in future periods  allied operations will continue to be impacted by mecar s ability to obtain large orders on a periodic basis and allied s ability to successfully continue its expansion of other business 
trends in liquidity and capital resources as detailed below  the company has substantial liquidity issues 
operating losses incurred in and have depleted the company s liquid assets and the alleged and potential defaults under a convertible note issued in further jeopardize the company s financial condition 
senior subordinated convertible notes the company closed a  senior subordinated convertible debt facility in march proceeds net of debt issue costs were approximately  a total of  was used to retire existing debt including the patriot facility 
the remaining  was used in to fund working capital and capital expansion 
these funds were initially raised to fund operations for a multi year period but in  due to mecar not receiving a significant order from its largest customer  operating losses of the us subsidiaries  and higher corporate expenditures related to compliances fees and investments in business development

debt covenant requires effective registration by march  the requirements of the debt covenant create further uncertainty regarding the company s liquidity position 
the terms of the convertible debt facility entered into in march required the company to file a registration statement with the sec by september  for resale of the shares of common stock underlying the convertible debt and warrants issued in the transaction  and to have the registration statement declared effective by march  as a result of the company s accounting restatements and the delayed filing of the form k for the period ended december   the company failed to make the required form s filing by september  and incurred approximately  of penalties and interest in the fourth quarter of on november   the company filed the form s and on january   the company subsequently filed form s a after receiving initial comments from the sec 
additional comments have since been received from the sec and the company is in the process of preparing a response letter 
the company is subject to interest penalties of of  outstanding balance per month until the registration statement is effective

the terms of the notes provide  in the event of default  the holders with the right to demand redemption at a price equal to the sum of the face value of the notes  accrued and unpaid interest  and a redemption premium equal to of the face value of the notes 
mecar credit facility default in addition  the company has been in default of the loan covenants with mecar s credit facility at december  and due to violations of financial performance covenants for which it has received waivers for each of the reporting periods 
mecar s banking group has been working with the company to restructure the terms of the facility as mecar has been restructuring its business to return to profitability 
on february  mecar received notification from its banks that they were temporarily suspending availability under the existing lines of credit until a meeting could be held to review the status of a mecar s anticipated contract with its largest customer and the company s operating plans and lending requirements for the balance of based on the meeting held on march   the temporary suspension was lifted on march  the company is continuing to work with mecar s banking group to come up with a long term credit solution including an increased facility to accommodate the anticipated contract from mecar s principal customer 
management of liquidity during the company incurred a net loss of  in the year ended december  the results for the year ended december  were a net loss before the cumulative effect of accounting change of  the company used cash from operating activities in the year ended december  of  as compared to  in the year ended december  as of december  the company had  of cash and equivalents and  of restricted cash 
the  of cash used in operating activities stemmed from the net loss from operations 
after adjusting for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  amortization of debt issue costs and conversion feature  and the adjustment of deferred income taxes the loss was  offsetting the use of cash from the net loss was a reduction in the working capital of the company 
in general  the company reduced its working capital in order to better manage its cash position 
the most significant reduction in working capital was the reduction of inventory levels by  this reduction compares to  of cash used for inventory in much of this improvement came from mecar 
mecar adjusted its purchasing habits to procure raw materials much later in the sales contract process while at the same time they began a much more critical evaluation of slow moving inventory and write downs for slow moving inventory 
the fluctuation in accounts receivable and cost and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts accounts for cash generated of  in and  in most of this cash generated resulted from the reduction of costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts at mecar 
as mecar did not receive its replenishment contract with its large customer in  the costs and accrued earnings balance was brought to a low level 
in addition  the company generated  of cash from the reduction of prepaid expenses and current assets and the increase of customer deposit balances 
the reduction of payables and accrued expenses used cash of  in which was a significant fluctuation from the  of cash generated from accounts payable and accrued expenses in this fluctuation was attributed to the timing of payments and the overall reduction in inventory purchases in in general  the company was able to manage its cash despite the significant operating losses in and the company has plans in place to reduce the fixed cost structure of its operating units to better manage its cash requirements in the company  based on the timing and capital requirements of a substantial new sales contract with mecar s large customer  may have to look for additional credit facilities to fund mecar s operations in the company s plan for the company anticipates receipt by mecar of a substantial order from its principal customer and improved performance by its other subsidiaries 
this principal customer has been a major customer since the late s  the company has anticipated receiving this order for approximately two years 
the company has engaged a consultant at mecar and is in the process of implementing a restructuring plan which will substantially decrease the break even point at mecar 
the parent company has also engaged a financial adviser to assist in cutting costs and improving us operations 
the parent company is also reviewing its strategic options 
in mid december   the company issued  shares of common stock in a private offering to certain of its larger shareholders and certain of the convertible debt holders and received approximately  in net proceeds for working capital in in january  the board of directors of the company made the decision to actively pursue the sale of seaspace  the sole business that constitutes the other segment 
management anticipates that the business will be sold in the first half of proceeds from the sale of the business will be used to fund headquarters expenses and for working capitals needs for the remaining businesses 
in  the company expects to fund its domestic operations with the cash balance available at december   the proceeds of the sale of seaspace  cash generated from the operations of its us subsidiaries  and the repayment from the belgium subsidiaries of approximately  for vendor invoices under intercompany payables 
in addition to the normal operating costs  the company may incur additional legal and consulting costs in conjunction with above discussed letters received from its note holders 
vsk s operations are expected to generate cash in the excess of cash can be used to provide additional funding to mecar s operations in mecar s cash flow should be positive in assuming that a significant new order is received from a key customer in the middle east 
if mecar is unable to obtain new orders from its key customer  the company will have to make further cost restructuring to ensure a break even operation in in late  the company developed a plan to restructure mecar s operations to substantially reduce the subsidiary s fixed costs and reduce the break even point in the company is currently developing contingency plans for mecar if an order from their key customer is not received 
the company may incur significant costs to achieve any permanent cost restructuring at mecar 
the excess costs related to a permanent restructuring of mecar or increased legal and consulting costs and interest and penalties associated with the company s senior notes would have to come from the sale of additional equity by the company and or the sale of existing assets 
in general  the company believes  it has sufficient cash to fund operations and capital expenditures over the next twelve months pending successful resolution of the senior convertible debt issues noted above 
the company is considering alternatives including restructuring the existing convertible notes  obtaining new credit facilities to replace the current convertible notes  or selling assets to repay the convertible notes 
the company has hired a financial advisor and is close to hiring an investment banking firm to assist in the process 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to get the common shares underlying the convertible debt financing registered and avoid the event of default with the note holders  the credit facility at mecar will not be suspended again and if mecar fails to meet the financial covenants the banking group will be willing to waive the covenants  the company will be able to sell seaspace in in order to use the cash proceeds for operations  the company will be able to issue additional shares of common stock to raise capital as needed  the company will be able to refinance any of its existing debt if it becomes callable 
the company has less than  of non firm capital commitments outstanding as of december  no additional capital commitments are necessary to support the company s revenue projections 
management is monitoring the cash situation on a weekly basis and expects that it will be sufficient if mecar receives the order it has been working on and seaspace is timely sold 
if not  and additional funds are required  the company may look to issue additional shares of its common stock to support its us operations and or sell additional european or us based assets 
however  management believes its ability to raise additional funds by selling additional shares of its common stock will be materially adversely affected if mercar has not secured the order from its key customer 
for the euro based businesses  the company may look to refinance and or expand the existing credit facility at mecar with the existing or newly formulated banking group although such expansion would likely be contingent on receiving additional  significant new orders 
results of operations the results were significantly affected by the foreign exchange impact on the operations of the company s euro based business units 
the results were positively affected by the translation of the company s european operations euro based income statements into dollars at more favorable exchange rates 
all euro based results of operations were converted at the average  and exchange rates of   and us dollar to euro  respectively

the company s consolidated revenues for increased  from due to the impact of the november acquisition of gms  increased revenue at nsm in the es segment and higher production activities and increased contracts completed in the current year in the ammunition weapons effects particularly related to the ramp up of operations in marshall texas 
in addition  the other segment had of increased revenue in the table below shows revenues by segments for the three year period 
revenues by segment ammunition weapons effects electronic security other the ammunition weapons effects segment revenue increased  in from levels primarily from the ramp up of operations in marshall  texas 
mecar s revenues were consistent at  in as compared to  in mecar s revenues were lower than pre revenues as the major contract from mecar s largest customer that was expected in was not received 
mecar has been in discussions with the customer and is still anticipating the receipt of a large order in based on a constant currency exchange rate for the year  mecar s revenues for would have been  rather than the  reported  a decrease of from in  titan had an increase in revenue from the battlefield effects simulator bes training system for the us army contract of  
these revenues resulted from an award titan received in for a firm fixed price  indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contract for the procurement of approximately  launchers and  cartridges and associated support for the bes training system 
the contract will provide bes with support for target systems for digital multi purpose range complexes  digital multi purpose training range  and battlefield area complex 
delivery orders totaling  have been received under the contract through the end of the titan idiq contract represents the department of defense estimate of the amount that could be spent by all branches of service on training and simulation products provided by titan over a five to eight year period 
mecar usa revenue increased by  to  as that subsidiary first became operational in late ammunition weapons effects segment revenues decreased in from levels due to reduced revenues at mecar 
mecar concluded work on the approximately  foreign military sales fms contract in the first quarter of  and did not receive the replenishment order from it largest customer in an increase of at titan and mecar usa operations offset the reduction at mecar as titan began delivery on the bes contract 
revenues for the electronic security segment increased  from the results for include a full year of gms activity 
in  only two months of activity for gms was included in the es segment results as the business was acquired in november gms revenues accounted for  of total es segment increase of the increase in the remainder of the increase came from nsm which reported an increase of  of the total es segment increase and vsk which reported an increase of of total es segment increase from the prior year 
nsm revenues increased from the prior year mainly as a result of two us army contracts in vsk s revenue growth was slower than the remainder of the segment as the revenues in europe were flat for the year 
at a constant exchange rate  vsk would have reported revenues of  rather than the  reported an increase of rather than the actual increase of from electronic security segment revenue decreased in from levels primarily from reduced revenues at nsm of  nsm did not receive several large contracts that were expected in these decreases were offset by increases at vsk and gms 
the increase at vsk of was principally the result of continued expansion of its export sales via its european distribution network 
in addition  gms was acquired in november and generated  of revenue 
other segment revenues increased by in as compared to as a result of new management initiatives and increased antenna sales 
in  revenues for the other segment declined by from as the business faced competitive pressures in its traditional product base 
cost of sales by segment of of of segment segment segment revenue revenue revenue ammunition weapons effects electronic security other corporate cost of sales 
cost of sales cos as a percentage of revenue was  and in  and respectively see table above 
gross margin  as a percentage of revenues  were   and in  and  respectively 
in general  a reduction in the gross margin percentage in the awe segment was offset by an margin improvement in the es segment 
the other segment had margins of in and in the reduction in cos as a percentage of revenues from in to in resulted from the strong increase in es segment revenues as compared to awe segment revenues for  and reduced product costs within the es segment 
the overall increase of  in in cos was attributed to a  increase in awe cos  a  increase in es cos  offset by a net decrease of in other and corporate segments 
awe segment s cos increased from of revenues in to of revenues in this increase to cos stemmed from all business units within the awe segment 
mecar s cost of sales went from  or of revenues in to  or of revenues in on a relatively flat revenue base 
the increase at mecar resulted from higher fixed costs than the prior year 
in  mecar had approximately million of its revenue from its largest customer as compared to approximately million of revenues from this customer in the margins with these large customer contracts are substantially higher than the margins for other contracts 
these higher margins are not due only to better absorption of fixed overhead costs but also to lower direct material costs 
in addition  fixed overhead costs related to depreciation  fixed labor and inventory obsolescence increased from the prior year 
new provisions for early retirement and overtime pay were implemented in in addition to the increased cos at mecar  the marshall texas facility had increased cos from the prior year 
in  as the marshall facility was being established  the two business units in that facility titan and mecar usa  reported gross margins of on  of revenues 
in  as building improvements were made and manufacturing headcount increased  the margins were negative on  of revenue 
these fixed costs at the marshall facility were cut back in late as the revenue growth in was not as high as initially anticipated when the costs were added 
cos as a percentage of revenues for the es segment decreased from in to in gross margins went from in to in this improvement in gross margins is attributed to the first full year of gms operations included in the es segment in  and the increased sales volume at nsm in revenues were up from the prior year  offset by a downturn of the margin at vsk 
the gross profit on gms products are typically higher than the margins of the other business units in the es segment as gms production is more in house manufacturing of a niche product and less system integration manufacturing as nsm and vsk have 
nsm had margins of in as compared to in the improvement in was attributed to the increase in revenues at nsm from  in to  over the same fixed base of costs related to nsm s relatively fixed overhead and inventory write downs in as nsm faced a downturn in the business 
seaspace and corporate have a net decrease of in cos due to reduced spending 
the increase in cos percentage from to was driven by a year to year decline in mecar sales volumes and high fixed year to year cos expenses 
mecar usa and titan cos as a percentage of revenue actually improved from to  but not enough to offset the unfavorable movement at mecar 
cos within electronic security as a percentage of sales increased from to due to a significant decline in us based sales at nsm and a lack of a corresponding decrease in expenses partly offset by the acquisition of gms in november of vsk sales increased slightly from to vsk cos grew at a faster pace than sales resulting in less favorable performance 
seaspace had an increase in cos as a percentage of sales although the increase was not large enough to impact the consolidated results 
overall many of adg s segments operate within a relatively fixed cost environment 
sales declines on a year to year basis  below these fixed costs levels  can have an unfavorable impact on profitability 
the company is focused on reducing these breakeven points wherever it can on both a tactical and strategic level 
the company is also investing in business development and sales and marketing programs to ensure sales stay well above the break even levels 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative sa expenses as a percentage of revenue were   and for  and respectively 
the overall sa increase of  from to is attributed to a  increase in corporate expenses  a  increase in the es segment  offset by decreases of  in the awe segment and  in the other segment 
the increase of  at the corporate level resulted from the adoption of fas r effective january  which resulted in a non cash charge related to increased compensation expense for stock options  restricted stock grants and the employee stock purchase plan  increased legal and professional fees of approximately  increased costs associated with the new business development group of  higher travel  staffing  and compliance costs of  the startup cost associated with the new consolidated benefits plan of and increased depreciation expense associated with implementation of an erp system of  offset by decreased bonus compensation expenses of in within the es segment  nsm sa expenses decreased by  in from as a result of reduced spending 
the decreased in nsm was offset by the increase of in vsk and  in gms 
the increase in gms resulted from the first full year of gms operations consolidated in the company s results in within awe  sa expenses decreased at mecar  mecar usa and titan 
lower expenses at mecar resulted from cost savings programs  mainly related to head count reductions that were put in place to reduce mecar s fixed operating cost structure 
mecar usa and titan costs decreased as they were in their second year of operations and the buildup cost was no longer necessary in the decrease in other segment was a result of reduced spending and better cost management 
from to  awe sa expenses increased at mecar  mecar usa and titan 
after mecar sales failed to materialize in  sa levels were cut back to preserve profitability  but not enough to offset the rapid decline in sales over that period 
mecar usa and titan costs increased as new facilities and staffing came on line in marshall  tx 
within the es segment  vsk sa costs increased as a constant percentage of sales 
as nsm sales fell from to  sa costs remained relatively flat adversely impacting the percentage comparison 
allied headquarters cost also grew during the same period from  to  these increases were drive by higher staffing  compliance and audit costs

in  the company recorded goodwill impairment of  related to seaspace 
this impairment resulted from competition for seaspace s products and inability to meet historical and current projections 
there was no impairment recorded in interest income 
interest income increased in from by this increase is attributed to more investing activities related to cash balances in income earned on interest bearing accounts throughout the company has been affected by the higher interest rates and the overall higher cash levels 
at corporate  the cash levels increased during much of as a result of the march financing 
interest income levels were consistent at in as compared to in interest expense 
interest expense significantly increased in from by  to  this increase is mainly due to the interest related to the  senior subordinated convertible notes issued on march  these notes bear interest at the rate of annually paid quarterly 
the company incurred interest expense of  related to these notes in in addition to the normal rate of interest on these notes  the company had to pay approximately  in penalties and interest related to the company s failure to complete its form s filing to register the underlying common stock in the march debt financing

these tax valuation allowances were recorded by the company based on the losses incurred over the past few years for these subsidiaries 
cumulative effect of accounting change net of income taxes 
effective january   mecar changed its methodology for applying the percentage of completion in an effort to better reflect revenue recognized over the life of its sales contracts 
previously  mecar used total direct costs as the basis for recognizing revenue  but subsequently elected to use only direct labor as the basis of recognition 
the cumulative effect of the accounting change for was  net of income taxes

net earnings loss 
the company incurred a net loss of  in as compared to a net loss of  in the increased  in net loss from to was due primarily to the  of valuation allowance recorded against the mecar s deferred tax asset offset by the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  recorded in and a reduction in the pre tax loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the loss in includes a nonrecurring adjustments charged for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of  net of income taxes of  and seaspace goodwill impairment of  excluding the nonrecurring charges  the pre tax net loss for was  as compared to  in the winding down of mecar s fms contract and the lack of replacement contracts were the principal cause for both and net loss 
in  mecar changed its methodology for applying the percentage of completion contract accounting for the recognition of revenue 
prior to this change in  mecar used total direct costs as the basis for recognizing revenue  but subsequently elected to use only direct labor as the basis in an effort to better reflect revenue recognized during the life of sales contracts 
the pre tax loss of  in compares  of income in mainly as a result of favorable operating profit at mecar in backlog 
as of december   the company s backlog was  compared to  at december  and  at december  the  and amounts included unfunded portions from an indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq federal contract awarded to nsm 
this backlog is calculated by taking all committed contracts and orders and deducting shipments or revenue recognized pursuant to the percentage of completion method of accounting as applicable 
the table below shows the backlog of the new segments for the three year period 
backlog by segment amount amount amount ammunition weapons effects electronic security other the decrease in the backlog for the ammunition weapons effects segment is attributable to decreases at mecar  titan and mecar usa 
the decrease in mecar s backlog is attributable to the continuing delay in receipt of new orders from mecar s largest  long standing customer and the completion of previously awarded contracts  offset by the appreciation of the euro during the year 
mecar continues to expect such orders in in addition to meeting the ammunition needs of its traditional customers  mecar has undertaken a customer diversification effort in the past few years  which has contributed to a majority of its new orders for the majority of titan s backlog reflects the orders under the idiq contract awarded in april the decrease in titan s backlog is attributable to slight decrease of new orders in and completion of more of the bes contract in mecar usa became operational in late and received its first contract valued at approximately  much of the decrease in mecar usa s backlog is attributable to fewer new orders and completion of previously funded contracts 
electronic security backlog increased in a result of the increase in the nsm backlog of  which is attributable to an increase in new u 
s army contracts 
in addition  the backlog for vsk increased by  which is attributable to an increase in new orders  as well as the appreciation of the euro during the year 
these increases were offset by a decline in the gms backlog of electronic security s  and backlogs include unfunded portions of   and  respectively  from an idiq federal contract at nsm 
other segment backlog increased by in due to an increase in new orders 
liquidity and capital resources the company incurred a net loss of  and had net cash used from operations of  in the company had a december  cash and cash equivalents balance of  and restricted cash of  the company closed a  convertible debt facility in march net proceeds were approximately   was used to retire existing debt including the patriot facility 
the remaining  was available to be used to fund working capital needs 
in mid december  the company raised an additional  by issuing an additional  shares of common stock to several of its larger shareholders 
the company expended nearly all of the net proceeds from the convertible note financing before december  and may look to explore other sources of additional liquidity pending the anticipated return of substantial business from mecar s traditional customer base in profitable operations of the u 
s based subsidiaries 
the company expects positive cash flows from the us dollar based and euro based sources within the electronic security segment in  but the company is incurring additional professional fees from addressing its liquidity issues 
euro based ammunition and weapons effects cash flow should be positive in if significant new orders are received from a key customer in the middle east 
this principal customer has been a major customer since the late s  the company has anticipated receiving this order for approximately two years 
should those orders not materialize by the second quarter of  further cost restructuring will be necessary to ensure a cash breakeven operation in the company has engaged in a substantial restructuring of mecar s operations to reduce the mecar s fixed costs and reduce the break even point 
contingency plans are being evaluated and put in place should those contracts be delayed beyond the second quarter of the us dollar based awe operations are being consolidated and downsized to lower their cash break even point as well 
new capital projects will be delayed in as cash resources are constrained 
the delay of these projects  if necessary  should not have a negative impact on the baseline revenues projected in at the headquarters level  the company believes that the audit  travel and outside contractor costs related to the restatements incurred during will not be recurring in but it will incur additional professional fees in addressing its liquidity issues

in the event some or all of the notes are called  the company will not have sufficient cash to meet its obligations to redeem the notes 
on february   the company received a letter from kings road investments  ltd 
kings road  one of the holders of the notes in the convertible debt facility  asserting events of default under the note 
the letter states that kings road is electing to accelerate and redeem the note in its entirety

under the terms of the notes  if a note holder is not timely paid upon an event of default  at any time before it receives such payment  it may rescind its redemption demand and reclaim its note with a new conversion price  which may be the lowest closing price since the date of the initial redemption notice 
the company disputes the alleged events of default 
the company is currently in discussions with kings road  portside and lbi in an attempt to resolve these issues 
the company has not received a similar default notice from the other purchaser of the convertible notes 
in addition  the company has been in default of the loan covenants with mecar s credit facility at december  and due to violations of financial performance covenants for which it has received waivers for each of the reporting periods 
mecar s banking group has been working with the company to restructure the terms of the facility as mecar has been restructuring its business to return to profitability

the company is evaluating a variety of options to increase its liquidity in in january  the board of directors of the company approved the sale of seaspace  the sole entity that constitutes the other segment 
the sale is anticipated to be competed in the first half of proceeds of the sale will be used in operations 
the company may look to raise additional capital by issuing additional shares of its common stock 
the company is exploring possible asset backed financing from local banks at its us based awe facilities that would be earmarked for capital improvement buildings and or equipment at that site 
if this funding is not available  the company may look to postpone further capital expansion beyond the company will evaluate the disposition of certain assets in addition to the other segment 
the company has the option of issuing dividends and or loaning funds between its operating units to fund all operations 
the company will look to further consolidate its operations and eliminate fixed costs to enhance operating performance 
balance sheet 
all items on the company s december  consolidated balance sheet were affected by the increased value of the euro in all euro based activity was converted at the december  and closing exchange rate of and us dollar to euro  respectively 
historically  the company s positive cash flow from operations and available credit facilities have provided adequate liquidity and working capital to fully fund the company s operational needs 
working capital  which includes restricted cash  was  at december   which compares to  at december  in  the most significant changes in working capital resulted from the reclassification of the  senior convertible note from long term obligations to current liabilities at december   and reductions in costs and accrued earnings and inventory levels of  and  respectively from the balance at december  to december  these reductions mainly came from a reduced backlog of contracts as mecar 
in addition  prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased  from the prior year as mecar s prepaid bank fees  taxes and receivable from the sale of the firing range were reduced 
as a result of the full tax valuation allowance booked for the us operations and mecar  the current deferred tax asset balance decreased by  from the prior year 
offsetting these reductions in current assets was  increase in the cash balance at december  from the prior year 
current liabilities from to increased by  this increase mainly resulted from the reclassification of the  senior convertible note and from reduced payables as inventory purchases were reduced by mecar in offset by an increase in customer deposits at mecar 
overall  much of the change in working capital stemmed from mecar  as new larger contracts were not received in and the reclassification of the  senior convertible note from long term obligations to current liabilities at december  the cash balance at december  was  as compared to  at december  the increase in the cash balance mainly resulted from an increased balance at mecar of  an increased balance at the us corporate headquarters of  and a higher balance at the vsk of  the change in mecar s balance is attributed to the timing of payments and an increase in customer deposits with a lower proportion being restricted 
the increase in the balance at headquarters is attributed to the march issuance of convertible bonds and the december issuance of common stock by the company 
the change in the vsk balance results from the cash generated from operations 
restricted cash balances have been relatively consistent   and  at december  and  respectively 
the restricted cash balance is mainly attributed to mecar s customer deposits that are required by the customer to be restricted 
accounts receivable increased  from december  to december  as a result of strong fourth quarter revenues  particularly with the es segment 
costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts decreased  from year end primarily as a result of lower level of contracts worked on in at mecar 
mecar has fewer orders in process and in the backlog than prior years as the business awaits a replenishment order from its largest customer 
inventories decreased by  to  primarily from reduced purchases at mecar 
as mecar s new sales orders and backlog decreased in  the business cut back on inventory purchases 
in most years and for most contracts  mecar would look to purchase inventory late in the sales process and close to the receipt of signed sales contracts 
an exception to this policy was made in  when purchases were made in anticipation of certain sales orders to compensate for the long lead times of material deliveries 
in  the management of mecar returned to the practice of purchasing much later in the sales process and basing these purchases on signed contracts 
prepaid and other current assets decreased to  at december  from  at december  primarily from lower prepaid taxes and commissions at mecar as well as from cash collected in from the receivable due from the sale of mecar s firing range 
property  plant equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  increased by  to  at december  from  at december  this increase in property  plant and equipment resulted from the addition of fixed assets at mecar and the marshall texas facility  which became operational in third quarter the purchases at mecar were for the completion of a surface treatment plant that was started in and replacement of worn equipment 
in addition in  the company s corporate head quarters purchased an erp computer system for all us operations 
the fixed asset additions were offset by an increase of  to accumulated depreciation from depreciation expense 
intangible assets decreased primarily from the amortization of intangibles with definitive lives 
goodwill increased mainly as a result of a purchase price adjustment for the gms acquisition of the bank overdraft facility decreased at december  as a result of the timing of payments at mecar 
the current maturities of long term debt increased from the prior year as the repayment terms to the note payable  originated with the purchase of gms were modified to include  of principal payments in  as reclassified based on its terms 
current senior convertible note also increased due to the reclassification of the  senior convertible note from long term obligations to current liabilities at december  accounts payable at december  decreased from december  by  to  due to a lower balance at mecar 
as mecar s inventory purchases and spending were reduced in due to fewer new sales orders  the accounts payable decreased 
customer deposits increased primarily at mecar as a result of new contracts with new customers in in which mecar required deposits 
traditionally  the terms of mecar s fms contracts did not provide customer deposits to mecar 
in  as a larger portion of mecar s revenues were with new customers with higher risk  additional customer deposits were required by mecar 
the current liability for foreign exchange contracts decreased to from  at december   as a result of mecar having no foreign exchange contracts outstanding at december  the current liability balance at december  comes from vsk which has a forward contract that expires at july  vsk s forward contract balance was asset balance at december  income taxes increased due to a tax accrual booked by mecar based on an audit by the belgian tax authority 
at december   the company had  classified as short term note to be refinanced that represented the patriot note 
that amount was paid off in march as the company issued  of senior subordinated convertible notes and warrants 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain hybrid instruments  the company has elected to treat the notes as a hybrid instrument while the warrants were determined to be a derivative instrument and as such the company values both securities at their fair value 
see note m of the financial statements for a description of transaction and accounting treatment 
the fair value of the notes issued in march was  at december  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the warrants are treated as a liability  as a derivative instrument  and recorded at their fair value which was  at december  stockholders equity as of december   was negatively affected by the net loss for this decrease was offset by an increase in the value of the euro versus the us dollar  which resulted in an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the euro appreciated by approximately from december  cash flows 
the table below provides the summary cash flow data for the periods presented for the years ended december net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities 
the company used  of cash in its operating activities during as compared to  of cash during the same period of the  of cash used in operating activities stemmed from the net loss from operations 
after adjusting for non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and the adjustment of deferred income taxes the loss was  the net loss for after adjusting for non cash depreciation and amortization  the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  goodwill impairment  the write off of in process research and development  amortization of debt issue costs and conversion feature  and the adjustment of deferred taxes  was  offsetting the use of cash from the net loss was a reduction in the working capital of the company 
in general  the company reduced its working capital in order to better manage its cash position 
the most significant reduction in working capital was the reduction of inventory levels by  this reduction compares to  of cash used from inventory in much of this improvement came from mecar 
mecar adjusted its purchasing habits to procure raw materials much later in the sales contract process while at the same time they began a much more critical evaluation of slow moving inventory and write downs for slow moving inventory 
the fluctuation in accounts receivable and cost and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts accounts for cash generated of  in and  in most of this cash generated resulted from the reduction of costs and accrued earnings on uncompleted contracts at mecar 
as mecar did not receive its replenishment contract with its large customer in  the costs and accrued earnings balance was brought to a low level 
in addition  the company generated  of cash from the reduction of prepaid expenses and current assets and the increase of customer deposit balances 
the reduction of payables and accrued expenses used cash of  in which was a significant fluctuation from the  of cash generated from accounts payable and accrued expenses in this fluctuation was attributed to the timing of payments and the overall reduction in inventory purchases in cash paid for interest was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash paid for income taxes was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  and includes federal  foreign and state taxes 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities decreased between and which mainly resulted from the acquisition of gms 
in  the company purchased gms for net cash of  in and in capital expenditures were  in which is less than the  spent in the company anticipates that cash generated from operations and financing using capital leases will be sufficient to support any further necessary capital expenditures in the foreseeable future 
future expenditures will be primarily incurred at mecar and mecar usa for machinery and equipment 
in addition  the company received  in cash from the sale of mecar s firing range land in financing activities 
the company generated  of cash in financing activities during and generated  of cash during the same period of the cash generated in came from the  debt facility issued in march and the sale of common stock that raised  in december offset by the payoff of the patriot debt facility of  in march the cash generated in mainly stemmed from the  draw down of the senior debt facility to finance the acquisition of gms and increased borrowings on mecar s overdraft facility 
the financing activities by operating subsidiaries are more fully explained below 
allied 
the parent company continues to operate based on fees and dividends received from its subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of its securities 
allied has made cash infusions to seaspace  nsm and the marshall facilities to support working capital requirements 
in addition  in  allied paid some of mecar s trade payables on a short term financing basis 
the company refinanced its senior debt facility in the first quarter of on march   allied entered into a securities purchase agreement with several purchasers for the private placement of senior subordinated convertible notes in the principal amount of  and related warrants to purchase common stock of allied the transactions 
the notes accrue interest at a rate of per annum  subject to adjustment  with accrued interest payable quarterly in arrears in cash 
the term of the notes is five years  and the notes are convertible into shares of common stock of allied at a conversion price of  subject to standard anti dilution provisions 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  allied issued warrants to the purchasers exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of allied common stock 
the warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at an exercise price of per share  subject to standard anti dilution provisions similar to the provisions set forth in the notes 
the company s goal is to enhance the strength of its balance sheet and provide flexibility to pursue its growth strategies 
the notes have been accounted for as a hybrid financial instrument and were valued at its fair value at inception 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the warrants were treated as a liability at march  and continued to be treated as such at december  mecar 
mecar continues to operate from internally generated cash and funds provided by its bank syndicate and financing from capital leases 
mecar also received cash from an affiliate to fund operations 
the bank syndicate agreement provides i lines of credit for tax prepayments and working capital and ii a facility for guarantees bonds to support customer contracts 
the financial lending terms and fees are denominated in euros and the dollar equivalents will fluctuate according to global economic conditions 
the bank agreement imposes two financial covenants requiring mecar to maintain minimum net worth and working capital levels 
in addition  the company has been in default of the loan covenants with mecar s credit facility at december  and for which it has received waivers for each of the reporting periods 
mecar s banking group has been working with the company to restructure the terms of the facility as mecar has been restructuring its business to return to profitability 
on february  mecar received notification from its banks that they were temporarily suspending availability under the existing lines of credit until a meeting could be held to review the status of a mecar s anticipated contract with its largest customer and the company s operating plans and lending requirements for the balance of the meeting was held on march  and the temporary suspension was lifted by march  mecar s obligations under the bank syndicate agreement continue to be collateralized by a pledge of mecar s assets 
the agreement includes allied s pledge to support mecar so that it remains in compliance with its total borrowing obligations 
the company is continuing to work with mecar s banking group to come up with a long term solution 
vsk group 
vsk operated throughout solely from cash generated from business operations 
vsk is obligated on several mortgages and other long term obligations 
other subsidiaries 
nsm  seaspace and the marshall texas facilities operated in from cash generated from operations and cash infusions by allied 
gms operated in from cash generated from operations 
stock repurchases 
the company did not repurchase any shares of its common stock in and does not anticipate repurchasing any shares in contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
as described herein and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  allied has contractual obligations and commercial commitments that may affect its financial condition 
however  based on management s assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of the material contractual obligations and commercial commitments of allied  there is no known trend  demand  commitment  event or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur which would have a material adverse effect on allied s financial condition or results of operations 
the following table identifies material contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years amount in s long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating leases registration rights penalties foreign exchange contracts purchase obligations total contractual obligations commercial commitments total bank guarantees interest payments on long term debt which are excluded above are estimated to be    and for the above periods  assuming interest rates of    and 
mecar enters into foreign exchange contracts to reduce the currency risk associated with sales contracts that are set in a currency other than mecar s functional currency 
since mecar only enters into these contracts to offset a sales contract amount  the company considers these obligations from foreign exchange contracts to be offset and thereby cash neutral and not required to be included in this schedule 
at december   the company had a net liability of recorded for these contracts that will settle within nine months 
future liquidity 
allied is addressing its current liquidity issues as described above 
allied s future liquidity will continue to depend on its ability to obtain substantial orders from its traditional customers and the success of its efforts to broaden its revenue base 
the company s ability to cover its anticipated future operating and capital requirements is dependent upon its continued ability to generate positive cash flow from the operations of its subsidiaries  particularly the operations of mecar and vsk  and its ability to successfully integrate its acquisitions 
the company looks for acquisitions to be accretive to operations within months  although this cannot be assured 
this will depend upon many factors including the successful release of new product offerings  successful research and development efforts  and increased market share 
in  the company expects to fund its domestic operations with the cash balance available at december   the proceeds of the sale of seaspace  cash generated from the operations of its us subsidiaries  and the repayment from the belgium subsidiaries of approximately  for vendor invoices under intercompany payables 
in addition to the normal operating costs  the company may incur additional legal and consulting costs in conjunction with above discussed alleged default of senior notes and its liquidity issues 
vsk s operations are expected to continue to generate positive cash flow in the excess of cash can be used to provide additional funding to mecar s operations in mecar s cash flow should be positive in assuming that a significant new order is received from a key customer in the middle east 
if mecar is unable to obtain new orders from its key customer  the company will have to make further cost restructuring to ensure a break even operation in during  the company engaged in a substantial restructurings of mecar s operations to reduce the subsidiary s fixed costs and reduce the break even point 
the company is currently developing contingency plans for mecar if an order from their key customer is not received by the second quarter of the company may incur significant costs to achieve any permanent cost restructuring at mecar 
the excess costs related to a permanent restructuring of mecar or increased legal and consulting costs and interest and penalties associated with the company s senior notes would have to come from the sale of additional equity by the company and or the sale of existing assets 
off balance sheet arrangements 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
mecar is required to provide performance bonds and advance payment guarantees for certain contracts  which are provided by mecar s bank syndicate 
mecar is obligated to repay the bank syndicate any amounts it pays as a result of any demands on the bonds or guarantees 
at december   the company had approximately  detachable warrants  for the purchase of common stock 
the warrants are exercisable for a term of five years at an exercise price of per share  subject to anti dilution provisions similar to the provisions set forth in the notes and expire on march  the warrants did not meet the requirement for equity classification in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  mainly because the warrants are required to settle in registered shares of the company s common stock 
the warrants were recorded as a derivative instrument and are being recorded and carried at the fair value of the instrument 
the company s cash balances are held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the us most of the amounts held outside the us could be repatriated to the us  but  under current law  would be subject to federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted by local laws 
allied has provided for the us federal tax liability on these amounts for financial statement purposes  except for foreign earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested outside the us the american jobs creation act of the act  enacted on october  the jobs act  provided for a temporary deduction on certain foreign earnings repatriated during a one year period for of dividends 
the deduction would result in an approximate federal tax rate on the repatriated earnings 
the company elected to take the benefit of the deduction for the dividends it received from its foreign subsidiaries in the jobs act also included a qualified manufacturing deduction that applies to domestic manufacturers 
the deduction  when fully phased in  will provide a deduction of up to of qualified manufacturing income 
the deduction cannot be claimed by companies in a net operating loss carry forward position 
therefore  the company did not claim a benefit related to the qualified manufacturing deduction 
the company has not quantified the impact of the qualified manufacturing deduction that it can use once the net operating loss carry forward has been fully used 
recent accounting pronouncements 
see note a to allied s consolidated financial statements for a description of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
allied does not anticipate that any of such pronouncements will have a material impact on its financial results 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an on going basis 
the company s estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates or judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following are its critical accounting policies which affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method goodwill and intangible asset valuation inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts derivative instruments valuation of deferred income taxes and income tax reserves 
revenue recognition via the percentage of completion method 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and cost estimation on fixed price contracts for which we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method is used by mecar  mecar usa  nsm and seaspace for substantially all of their fixed price sales contracts 
approximately  and of consolidated revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method during  and  respectively 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue is recognized on these contracts as work progresses during the period  using the percentage of direct labor incurred to total estimated direct labor mecar or on a total cost incurred to total estimated cost basis mecar usa  nsm and seaspace 
management reviews these estimates as work progresses and the effect of any change in cost estimates is reflected in the calculation of the expected margin and the percent complete 
if the contract is projected to create a loss  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period such loss first becomes known 
accounting for the profit on a contract requires the total contract value  the estimated total direct labor cost to complete which is equal to the sum of the actual incurred labor costs to date on the contract and the estimated labor costs to complete the contract s scope of work and or the estimated total direct cost to complete to date on the contract and the estimated total direct costs to complete the contracts scope of work  and the measurement of progress towards completion 
the estimated profit or loss on a contract is equal to the difference between the contract value and the estimated total cost at completion 
adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses under a contract  as experience is gained and as more information is obtained  even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change  or if contract modifications occur 
a number of internal and external factors affect our cost of sales estimates  including labor rates and efficiency variances and testing requirements 
while we believe that the systems and procedures used by the subsidiaries  coupled with the experience of their management teams  provide a sound basis for our estimates  actual results will differ from management s estimates 
the complexity of the estimation process and issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
in  mecar changed its basis for applying the percentage of completion method in an effort to better reflect the revenue recognized over the life of its sales contracts 
previously  mecar used total direct costs as the basis for recognizing revenue  but subsequently elected to use direct labor as the basis of recognition 
see further discussion in note d of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue on contracts that do not qualify for the percentage of completion method is taken on a shipment basis 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation 
the company adopted fasb no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on accounting for business combinations and goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal year accordingly  the company no longer amortizes goodwill from acquisitions  but continues to amortize other acquisition related intangibles with definitive lives and other costs 
as of december   the company had  of goodwill recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
in conjunction with the implementation of the accounting rules for goodwill  the company completed a goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment charge to earnings was required 
as required by sfas no 
 the company will perform a similar review each year or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment review is based on a discounted cash flow approach that uses estimates of future cash flows discounted at the company s weighted average cost of capital and a market capitalization approach 
the estimates used are consistent with the plans and estimates that the company uses to manage the underlying businesses 
if market conditions in these business units fail to meet expectations  it could negatively impact revenue or cost  and could result in charges for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
for intangible assets with definitive lives  the company amortizes the cost over the estimated useful life and assesses any impairment by estimating the future cash flow from the associated asset 
as of december   the company had  of gross intangible assets with definitive lives  which includes patents  customer lists  trademarks  etc 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flow related to these assets decreases in the future or the useful life is shorter than originally estimated  the company may incur charges to reflect the impairment of these assets 
impairment could also result if the underlying technology fails to gain market acceptance  if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance or if the market conditions in the related businesses are unfavorable pursuant to sfas for intangible assets with indefinite lives the company performs an impairment evaluation in accordance with fas at december  the company had  of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
inventory reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined based on an average cost basis 
the company s inventory includes raw materials  work in process and finished goods of  as of december  the company reviews its recorded inventory and estimates a write down for obsolete or slow moving items to their net realizable value 
the write down is based on current and forecasted demand and the age of the item  and therefore  if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
allowances for doubtful accounts are evaluated based upon detailed analysis and assessment of receivables that may not be collected in the normal course of operations 
some of our customers share the same weapons platforms 
for these customers  mecar  at times  produces inventory in anticipation of receiving signed contracts for their manufacture 
this inventory  while designated for a particular contact  can be used to fulfill other contracts as long as the customer uses the same weapons platforms 
at times the company may have inventory in excess of the number designated in a signed contract 
the company feels that this inventory is still viable as it is able to sell them to other customers that share the same platforms 
foreign currency translation 
the assets and liabilities of arc europe and subsidiaries including mecar  vsk and arc limited are translated into us dollars at year end exchange rates 
the resulting translation gains and losses are accumulated in a separate component of stockholders equity 
in years with greater currency fluctuation  the impact on the apparent change for the same line item eg property  plant equipment would appear more significant than if all assets or liabilities were held in the same functional currency eg us dollars 
as of december   of all company assets are located in belgium  making the company sensitive to year to year fluctuations in currency  particularly the euro 
income and expense items are converted into us dollars at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are credited or charged directly to operations 
for  income from belgium represented of the revenue for the company 
the company recognizes the significance of foreign subsidiary operations on reported financial results thus making this a critical accounting policy 
realizing the potential impact of year to year and average currency fluctuations on results  the company continues to expand and improve us operations to mitigate the effects of these fluctuations 
over the past three years the average rate for the euro versus the us dollar has remained relatively constant  resulting in little impact on reported revenue and operating margin 
if this stability in the average should change  the company will explore methods to effectively manage the impact on earnings 
derivative instruments 
the company designates its derivatives based upon the criteria established by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
sfas  as amended by sfas and sfas  requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
the accounting for the changes in the fair value of the derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
for a derivative designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the risk being hedged 
for a derivative designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and is subsequently reclassified to earnings when the hedge exposure effects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is reported in earnings immediately 
for a derivative that does not qualify as a fair value hedge or cash flow hedge  the change in fair value is recognized currently in net income 
the company believes that derivative accounting is critical to its estimates and financial reporting 
pursuant to sfas  hedge accounting and the subsequent restatements related to non hedge accounting have been material to the company s financial results for all periods reported and thereby represent a significant policy to the company 
looking forward  the company will look to effectively manage the accounting for its cash flow hedges and qualify for hedge accounting 
the company believes hedge accounting provides financial results that better describe the underlying economics of the company s transactions rather than the results reported under non hedge accounting 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
the company is subject to taxation by federal  state and international jurisdictions 
the company s annual provision for income taxes and the determination of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities involve a significant amount of management judgment and are based on the best information available at the time 
the company believes that it has recorded adequate liabilities and reviews those balances on a quarterly basis 
judgment is also applied in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets such as foreign tax credit carryovers will not be realized  a valuation allowance is established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
forward looking statements this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations  estimates and projections about the company and the industries in which it operates 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions future factors which are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
future factors include the following substantial reliance on mecar s principal customers to continue to acquire products on a regular basis  the cyclical nature of the company s military business  rapid technological developments and changes and the company s ability to continue to introduce competitive new products and services on a timely  cost effective basis  the ability of the company to successfully continue to expand its business base  the ability of the company s acquired businesses to mature and meet performance expectations  the mix of products services  domestic and foreign governmental fiscal affairs and public policy changes which may affect the level of purchases made by customers  changes in environmental and other domestic and foreign governmental regulations  changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rate fluctuation from market conditions  general risks associated with doing business outside the united states  including  without limitation  import duties  tariffs  quotas and political and economic instability  the effects of terrorist actions on business activities  customer orders and cancellations  and the united states and international governments responses to these terrorist actions  changes in government regulations  liability and other claims asserted against us  the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  and continued availability of financing  financial instruments and financial resources in the amounts  at the times  and on the terms required to support the company s future business 
we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risk factors can arise and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors  nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including foreign currency fluctuations and interest rates changes 
from time to time  we use derivatives to manage some portion of these risks 
our derivatives are agreements with independent third parties that provide for payments based on a notional amount 
as of december  and  all of the derivatives were related to actual or anticipated exposures of our transactions 
we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivatives 
however  we monitor our derivative positions by regularly evaluating our positions and the creditworthiness of the counterparties  all of whom we either consider credit worthy  or who have issued letters of credit to support their performance 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes might affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive derivatives and related positions 
this analysis is inherently limited because it represents a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
the effects of market movements may also directly or indirectly affect our assumptions and rights and obligations not covered by sensitivity analysis 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or the earnings effect from the assumed market rate movements 
interest rate sensitivity 
allied manages its debt and its available cash considering available investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
at december   allied had approximately million of fixed rate indebtedness 
although some of these rates adjust based on certain actions of the company  the company considers them fixed rate because the rates are not variable based on market conditions 
allied has not entered into any interest rate swaps or other derivatives with respect to its indebtedness 
cash available for investment is typically invested in short term funds  which generally mature in under days or money market funds 
in general  such funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
the carrying amounts approximate market value 
it is the company s practice to hold these investments to maturity 
assuming year end cash available for investment had been invested for the whole year including restricted cash  a change in interest rates would impact net interest income for the years ended december   and by million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  cash and restricted cash balances would increase by or million  million and million  at december   and  respectively 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt will also change based on interest rate changes 
exchange rate sensitivity 
allied maintains operations in several foreign countries 
approximately and of the company s revenue was derived from operations outside the united states in and  respectively 
accordingly  exposure exists to potentially adverse movement in foreign currency rates 
allied s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars and  accordingly  changes in the exchange rates between the allied subsidiaries local currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of such subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting the consolidated financial results 
allied does not hedge these matters because cash flows from international operations are generally re invested locally 
it is estimated that a change in the value of the euro would impact reported net losses for the years ending december  and and net earning for the year ending december  by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
a change in the value of the euro would impact reported total assets for the years ended december   and by million  million and million  respectively 
see note q of the consolidated financial statements for more information on financial instruments 
allied does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor does allied hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
allied regularly reviews its hedging program and may as part of this review determine at any time to change its hedging program
