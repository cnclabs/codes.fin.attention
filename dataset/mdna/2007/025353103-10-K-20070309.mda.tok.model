acquisition and affiliation summary when affiliating with a dental practice  we customarily acquire selected assets and enter into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
under our service agreements  we are responsible for providing all services necessary for the administration of the non clinical aspects of the dental operations 
the affiliated practice is responsible for the provision of dental care 
each of our service agreements is for an initial term of years 

table of contents during  and  we completed thirteen  ten and five acquisition and affiliation transactions  respectively 
in two of these transactions  we acquired non clinical assets and entered into long term service agreements with the affiliated practices 
in one of these transactions  we developed de novo dental facilities rather than acquiring non clinical assets  and we entered into a long term service agreement with the affiliated practice 
in of these transactions  we acquired non clinical assets  and the practice was combined with one of our existing affiliated practices and became subject to an existing service agreement 
finally  in one of these transactions  we acquired the assets of the practice  arizona s tooth doctor for kids tooth doctor  and as permitted by applicable state law  tooth doctor employs the dentists thus not necessitating a service agreement between us and the affiliated practice 
these acquisition and affiliation transactions resulted in the addition of four affiliated practices  dental facilities and operatories 
the  and acquisition and affiliation transactions  at the time of the transactions  generated million  million and million of patient revenue on an annualized basis  respectively 
we are constantly evaluating potential acquisition and affiliation transactions with dental practices and acquisitions of other dental related companies that would expand our business capabilities 
the number of new affiliations and acquisitions over the next twelve months could be at levels greater or less than we have achieved in recent years 
revenue overview net revenue our net revenue includes management fees earned by us pursuant to the terms of the service agreements with the affiliated practices  as well as reimbursement of clinic expenses paid by us on their behalf  and other revenue which includes patient revenue of tooth doctor  fees earned by our dental benefits third party administrator tpa and fees earned by our dental laboratory 
the following table provides the components of our net revenue for  and in thousands reimbursement of expenses business service fees revenue earned under service agreements other revenue net revenue fees earned under service agreements include reimbursement of expenses incurred by us on behalf of the affiliated practices in connection with the operation and administration of dental facilities and service fees charged to the affiliated practices pursuant to the terms of the service agreements for management services provided and capital committed by us 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of a monthly fee which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under a certain service agreement  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists of i a monthly fee for the first six months of the year equal to the prior year service fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the increase of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the prior year and ii a monthly fee for the second six months of the year which is based upon a specified percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses 
under certain service agreements  representing of our service fees  our service fee consists entirely of a fixed monthly fee determined by agreement of us and the affiliated practice in a formal planning process 
under a certain service agreement  representing less than of our service fees  our service fee consists of a fixed monthly fee and an additional performance fee based upon a percentage of the amount by which the affiliated practice s patient revenue exceeds expenses as compared to the planned amount for the current year 
in all instances  the service fee is negotiated at fair market value for services provided and capital committed by us to the affiliated practices 

table of contents reimbursement of expenses includes costs incurred by us for the operation and administration of the dental facilities that include salaries and benefits for non dentist personnel working at the dental facilities the administrative staff and  where permitted by law  the dental assistants and hygienists  lab fees  dental supplies  office occupancy costs of the dental facilities  depreciation related to the fixed assets at the dental facilities and other expenses such as professional fees  marketing costs and general and administrative expenses 
for additional information on components of our net revenue  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
patient revenue of the affiliated practices we believe it is important to understand patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
this includes the practices that we do not control  nor own any equity interests in  and are affiliated with us by means of service agreements 
we do not consolidate the financial statements of these affiliated practices with ours  and accordingly their patient revenue is not a measure of our financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles because it is not our revenue 
it is however  a financial measure we use  along with the patient revenue of tooth doctor  to monitor operating performance and to help identify and analyze trends of the affiliated practices which may impact our business 
most of the operating expenses incurred by us  pursuant to service agreements  are on behalf of the affiliated practices in the operation of dental facilities 
these expenses are significantly affected by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices 
the affiliated practices generate revenue from providing care to patients and receive payment from patients and dental benefit providers  or payors  under fee for service  ppo plans and managed care capitation plans 
patient revenue reflects the amounts billed by an affiliated practice at its established rates reduced by any contractual adjustments and allowances for uncollectible accounts 
contractual adjustments represent discounts off established rates negotiated pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
while payor mix varies from market to market  the following table provides the aggregate payor mix of all affiliated practices  including tooth doctor  for the years ended december fee for service ppo and dental referral plans capitated managed care plans for the affiliated practices that we do not own and are affiliated with us by means of a service agreement  after collection of fees from patients and third party insurers for the provision of dental care and payment to us of our service fee and reimbursement of clinic expenses incurred by us on their behalf  the amounts remaining are used by these affiliated practices for compensation of dentists and  in certain states  hygienists and or dental assistants who are employed by these affiliated practices

same market patient revenue growth for excludes platform affiliations that occurred after january  amounts retained by affiliated practices we do not own increased in and in the increase in was attributable to greater profitability levels at the affiliated practices 
the increase in is primarily due to practice affiliations during the periods of comparison where the affiliated practices are required to employ the hygienists and dental assistants

net revenue increased to  in from 
table of contents  in this increase was attributable to an increase in same market net revenue growth and incremental net revenue earned from our platform affiliation completed in february  offset by a decrease in other revenue 
the decrease in other revenue in is primarily attributable to a decrease in dental laboratory fees as a result of an increasing percentage of fees being earned from our affiliated dental groups 
the percentage of lab fees being earned from our affiliated dental groups was  and for  and  respectively 
net revenue derived from our service agreement with pdg  pa  the affiliated practice at park dental  represented approximately   and of our consolidated net revenue for  and  respectively 
net revenue from our service agreement with wisconsin dental group  sc  the affiliated practice at forward dental  represented approximately of our consolidated net revenue for each of the years  and no other service agreement or customers accounted for greater than of our consolidated net revenue 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits expense includes costs for personnel working at the dental facilities  dental laboratory and local and regional shared service centers 
at the facility level  we generally employ the administrative staff and  where permitted by state law  the hygienists and dental assistants 
we also employ the dentists at tooth doctor 
the personnel at the local and regional shared service centers support the dental facilities 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased to in from in this decrease was primarily attributable to staff productivity increases at the affiliated dental groups and to a lesser extent in market affiliations completed in where we do not employ the hygienists and dental assistants  thereby lowering our salaries and benefits expense in relation to net revenue earned 
salaries and benefits expense as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in this decrease was primarily attributable to staff productivity increases  as well as the impact of our platform affiliation with premier dental partners which is located in missouri  a state where we do not employ the hygienists and dental assistants 
lab fees and dental supplies lab fees and dental supplies expense varies from affiliate to affiliate and is affected by the volume and type of procedures performed 
lab fees and dental supplies expense as a percentage of net revenue was in and  and in this percentage has remained relatively constant since due to increased utilization of our dental laboratory by the affiliated practices and to a lesser extent our continued focus on managing dental supplies expenses 
these expenses are largely impacted by the patient revenue of the affiliated practices and as a percentage of patient revenue was in and  and for office occupancy office occupancy expense includes rent expense and certain other operating costs  such as utilities  associated with dental facilities  dental laboratory and the local and regional shared service centers 
such costs vary based on the size of each facility and the market rental rate for dental office and administrative space in each particular geographic market 
office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in this increase is primarily due to the relocations of our national information systems team and park dental resource group at the beginning of  a  lease buy out payment and  to a lesser extent  the full year impact of a relocation of a dental facility in office occupancy expense as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at for and in  we completed three de novo facilities and expanded nine facilities

in  we completed one de novo facility and relocated and or expanded nineteen facilities 

table of contents other operating expenses other operating expenses include non employment related insurance expense  professional fees  marketing costs and other general and administrative expenses 
other operating expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in from in this decrease is due to a decrease in professional fees at the affiliated dental groups  a reduction in other general and administrative expenses and  to a lesser extent  leveraging of these expenses at the affiliated dental groups  off set by an increase in computer consulting fees 
other operating expense remained constant as a percentage of net revenue at for and general corporate expenses general corporate expenses consist of compensation and travel expenses for our corporate personnel and administrative staff  facility and other administrative costs of our corporate office and professional fees  including legal and accounting 
general corporate expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to in from in this increase is due to costs associated with the pdg litigation see legal proceedings and stock based compensation expense 
general corporate expense decreased to in from in this decrease in as a percent of net revenue was due to a leveraging of our general corporate expenses 
we incurred approximately  in costs associated with the pdg litigation in we anticipate these costs  compared to the same period in  to remain consistent or increase over the first six months of due to preparation for the trial and the actual trial for the pdg litigation 
the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment sfas no 
r  effective january   resulted in  of stock based compensation expense  approximately  net of tax  in we anticipate these costs to increase approximately  in due to option grants 
finally  we expect a modest increase in general corporate office occupancy expense in as we are entering into a new lease in june  for a larger space to accommodate personnel growth at our corporate office 
depreciation depreciation expense  including amortization of leasehold improvements  as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at in and depreciation expense as an expense of net revenue increased to of net revenue in from in the increase in depreciation expense as a percent of net revenue in primarily related to increased investment in leasehold improvements and dental equipment and  to a lesser extent  amortization of software development costs relating to improvis which began in the fourth quarter of we expect to continue to invest in the development of new dental facilities and the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities in accordingly  depending on the amount and timing of such future capital expenditures  depreciation may increase in at a rate greater than our net revenue 
amortization of service agreements and other intangible assets amortization expense as a percentage of net revenue remained constant at in  and based on an evaluation of historical financial trends in  we determined that the intangible assets associated with certain in market affiliations which were combined with existing affiliated practices were expected to generate future cash flows for a longer period than previously estimated 
accordingly  we increased the amortization period relating to these intangible assets 
as a result  the amortization period for certain previously completed in market affiliations were increased to years 
this change in estimate impacted  at that time  of our intangible assets and had the effect of reducing amortization expense for by approximately  or  net of tax 
this change in estimate reduced amortization expense by approximately  or  net of tax  in 
table of contents amortization of intangible assets may increase in the future as a result of additional intangible assets recorded in connection with future affiliations and  if applicable and earned  contingent payments on already completed affiliations 
earnings from operations earnings from operations increased to  or of net revenue  in from  or of net revenue  in earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue decreased in primarily due to costs associated with the pdg litigation and stock based compensation in the amounts of  and  respectively 
earnings from operations increased to  or of net revenue  in from  or of net revenue  in earnings from operations as a percentage of net revenue increased in primarily due to increased productivity as a result of higher same market growth rates and leveraging of corporate expenses and other costs 
interest expense net interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase in was due to higher interest rates  off set by reduced average borrowings outstanding in compared to the increase in was due to increased borrowings compared to as well as an increase in libor interest rates

minority interest on december   we completed the acquisition of the assets of arizona s tooth doctor for kids 
the assets of tooth doctor were contributed to a newly created subsidiary which is owned by the company and by the principals of tooth doctor 
as a result of this transaction we began to consolidate the financial results of tooth doctor with our results in december  the minority interest represents the gain attributable to the minority shareholders for the period that we consolidated tooth doctor 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and  and in the decrease in was due to a reduction in state income taxes 
we expect our effective tax rate to be in due to increases in state income taxes 
net earnings as a result of the foregoing  net earnings increased to  or of net revenue  in from  or of net revenue  in the decrease as a percentage of net revenue is due to the costs associated with the pdg litigation and stock based compensation in the amount of  and  net of taxes  respectively 
net earnings increased to  or of net revenue  in from  or of net revenue  in in  net earnings reflect our increased earnings from operations and a reduction in our effective tax rate  offset by increased borrowing costs 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operating and capital needs  including cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  capital expenditures and working capital  principally from operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
we have  in the past  also used proceeds from the sale of equity securities and the issuance of subordinated promissory notes to finance certain capital needs  but have not done so in recent years 
for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items  an increase in accounts payable and a decrease in accounts receivable  primarily receivables due from affiliated practices 
the increase in accounts payable is primarily due to the 
table of contents timing of payables and an increase in outstanding checks in excess of deposits in transit as of december  as compared to december  the decrease in receivables due from affiliated practices was primarily due to a continued focus on receivables management at the affiliated practices 
the days sales outstanding for the patient receivables of the affiliated practices decreased from days at december  to days at december  for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operating activities amounted to  and  respectively 
in  cash from operations primarily resulted from net earnings after adding back non cash items and increases in accrued compensation offset by an increase in accounts receivable  primarily receivables due from the affiliated practices 
these changes resulted in cash from operations remaining essentially the same for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  and  cash used for investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the net increase of approximately  in cash used for investing activities is primarily due to an increase of  in cash used for acquisitions and affiliations  net of cash acquired  offset by decreases of  in contingent payments made as part of affiliations and  in capital expenditures 
the remaining increase is due to other investing activities 
the increase in cash paid for affiliations was due to  of cash consideration paid for the acquisition of tooth doctor 
the decrease in contingent payments is due to a  contingent payment made in as a result of a affiliation 
in addition  approximately  in contingent payments as a result of affiliations were accrued for as of december   and will be paid in the first quarter of capital expenditures decreased due to project timing as approximately  of relocation and or expansion projects have been extended into consequently  we expect capital expenditures in to increase significantly to approximately  in capital expenditures  which includes the carryover of projects  the relocation and or expansion of existing dental facilities  our on going facility maintenance capital expenditure program and investment in several information technology projects 
for the years ended december  and  cash used for investing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the increase of approximately  in cash used for investing activities is due to an increase of  in cash used for affiliations  net of cash acquired  an increase of approximately  in contingent payments made as part of affiliations and  to a lesser extent  an increase of approximately  in capital expenditures 
the remaining increase is due to other investing activities 
the increase in cash used for affiliations  net of cash acquired  was due to the completion of nine in market affiliations and one platform affiliation in compared to five in market affiliations completed in the increase in contingent payments was due to the aforementioned  contingent payment made in for the years ended december  and  cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and  respectively 
the decrease of  in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to less borrowing on our revolving credit facility of  during  offset by a decrease of  in repayments of subordinated debt in compared to the remaining decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due to  less in proceeds from the issuance of common stock for the exercise of stock options in offset by  in tax benefits recognized on the exercise of stock options and  in cash used for payment of debt issuance costs in borrowing on our credit facility decreased in due to our ability to use cash provided by operations to pay for affiliations in to a greater extent than repayments of subordinated debt decreased in due to the fact that we have not used subordinated debt as consideration for affiliations since proceeds from the exercise of stock options decreased in due to a reduced number of option exercises compared to  which was off set by a change in classification of tax benefits on the exercise of stock option from cash provided by operating activities to cash provided by financing activities as a result of the adoption  on january   of sfas no 
r share based payment 
for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities amounted to  and cash used for financing activities for the year ended december  was  the primary reason for the difference between the two periods is the aforementioned increase in affiliation activity during compared to in we borrowed  on the revolving credit facility to finance affiliations  while in the size and number of affiliations allowed us to pay down approximately  on our credit facility 

table of contents we have a  revolving credit facility that we use for general corporate purposes  including working capital  acquisitions  affiliations and capital expenditures 
the facility had an original maturity date of february and maximum borrowings under the line were scheduled to decrease to  in february the outstanding balance under this line as of december  was  and we had a stand by letter of credit amounting to  at december  the unused balance under this line as of december  was  and based on borrowing covenants  reduced by the stand by letter of credit   was available for borrowing 
on february   we amended our credit facility as a result of favorable credit markets and our improved financial position and extended the maturity to february amendments to the original facility included an increase in the facility capacity to  a decrease in the interest margin and a decrease in our commitment fees 
borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at either prime or libor plus a margin  at our option 
the margin is based upon our debt coverage ratio and ranges from to for prime borrowings and to for libor borrowings 
at december   the libor interest rate under the credit facility  including borrowing margin  was approximately and the prime interest rate under the credit facility was 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee on the unused balance of our credit facility ranging from to 
borrowings are limited to an availability formula based on earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization  adjusted for certain items  and are collateralized by a first lien on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the stock of our subsidiaries 
we are also required to comply with financial and other covenants  including minimum net worth  leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and maximum capital expenditures as defined by the credit agreement 
we were in compliance with our covenants as of december  our growth to date has resulted in large measure from our ability to affiliate with additional dental practices 
historically  we have used a combination of cash  debt and  to a lesser extent  common stock as consideration for past affiliations 
in recent years  the consideration paid has consisted of cash 
we intend to continue to use cash flow from operations and our revolving credit facility to provide funding for future affiliations 
if cash flow from operations is not sufficient or debt financing is not available as needed on terms acceptable to us  we may have to issue or sell equity securities or  if unsuccessful  modify our affiliation strategy 
we are constantly evaluating potential affiliations with dental practices that would expand our business as well as possible acquisitions of businesses that would broaden our business capabilities 
the number of practice affiliations over the next twelve months could be at levels greater than we have achieved during each of the past two years 
we believe that cash generated from operations and amounts available under our current revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash needs for working capital  capital expenditures  affiliations and acquisitions for at least the next year 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter long term debt revolving credit facility operating leases total in addition to these contractual obligations  future interest payments relating to our long term debt are fixed at a rate of and are due as follows in  in  in future interest obligations relating to our revolving credit facility are not determinable as the interest rate is variable and the agreement does not include a required principal repayment schedule 
we have not historically hedged our interest rate exposure and the principal balance fluctuates daily 
for additional information relating to our revolving credit facility  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
table does not reflect the february  amendment to credit facility extending its maturity to february operating lease payments include amounts which are to be reimbursed to us pursuant to the terms of our service agreements with the affiliated practices 
the amounts to be reimbursed by the affiliated practices are  and are due as follows  in   in   in  and  thereafter 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis management evaluates its estimates  including those related to the carrying value of receivables due from affiliated practices  goodwill  other intangible assets and loss reserves for our captive insurance company 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and in certain instances actuarial studies conducted by third parties  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
valuation of accounts receivable the company s carrying amount of receivables due from affiliated practices  that have entered into service agreements with us  requires management to assess the collectability of our business service fees 
our service fees are dependent on the economic viability of the affiliated practices based on actual and expected future financial performance including collectability of the affiliated practices patient receivables  net of contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts 
to date we have not recorded any losses related to our receivables due from affiliated practices 
the affiliated practices record revenue at established rates reduced by contractual adjustments and allowances for doubtful accounts to arrive at patient revenue 
contractual adjustments represent the difference between gross billable charges at established rates and the portion of those charges reimbursed pursuant to certain dental benefit plan provider contracts 
for contracts where there is no defined benefit  contractual adjustments are based upon historical collection experience and other relevant factors 
the affiliated practices provision for doubtful accounts is estimated in the period that services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as necessary 
the estimates for the provision and related allowance are based on an evaluation of historical collection experience  the aging profile of the accounts receivable  write off percentages and other relevant factors 
changes in these factors in future periods could result in increases or decreases in the provision 
in the event that final reimbursement or bad debt experience differs from original estimates  adjustments to the affiliated practices patient receivables would be required 
service agreements and intangible assets the company s affiliations with dental group practices as a result of the parties entering into a service agreement are not business combinations  and as such  do not result in recognition of goodwill 
the company recognizes capitalized service agreement costs which are accounted for as definite lived intangible assets acquired in other than a business combination  and recorded at fair value 
in determining the fair value of a service agreement recognized in connection with an affiliation  management estimates the timing  amount and value of future expected cash flows 
these service agreements have contractual terms of years but the asset is generally amortized on a straight line basis over a period of years 
customer relationship intangible assets associated with the acquisition of dental laboratories are amortized on a straight line basis over years 
intangible assets assigned to trade name as a result of the acquisition of tooth doctor are indefinite lived and not amortized 
in the event a service agreement is terminated  the related affiliated practice is required  at the company s option in nearly all instances  to purchase the remaining unamortized balance of intangible assets at the current book value  purchase other assets at the greater of fair value or book value  and assume leases and other liabilities related to the performance of the company s obligations under the service agreement 
management performs an impairment test on definite lived intangible assets when facts and circumstances exist which would suggest that the intangible assets may be impaired  by comparing the undiscounted net cash flows 
table of contents of the asset to its carrying value 
if impairment were determined  an appropriate adjustment to the intangible asset would be made to reduce the asset s carrying value to fair value 
fair value is determined by calculating the projected discounted operating net cash flows of the asset using a discount rate reflecting the company s average cost of funds 
the company has not recorded any impairment charges or write downs on definite lived intangibles as of december  insurance we maintain various insurance coverages for our business  including property casualty  business interruption  workers compensation and general liability  among others 
in addition  the affiliated practices are required to maintain  or cause to be maintained  professional liability insurance with us as a named insured 
beginning in  certain of our insurances will be reinsured by a wholly owned captive insurance company licensed in the state of vermont 
several of these insurance programs have retention levels in which we and our captive insurance company are financially obligated for insured losses below certain financial thresholds before the insurer is financially obligated for insured losses 
we and our captive insurance company maintain reserves for certain of these programs  which are based upon estimates provided by third party actuaries or by individual case basis valuations 
changes in trends of loss severity or loss frequency may affect the calculation of these estimates and create the need for subsequent adjustments to estimated loss reserves 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provision of sfas no 
r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected life  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected life volatility  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in these assumptions for future stock option grants can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the interpretation will have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application encouraged 
any amounts recognized upon adoption as a cumulative effect adjustment will be recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we have not yet determined the impact of this statement on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
with regard to our revolving credit facility  we are also exposed to variable rate interest for the banks applicable margins  ranging from to based upon our debt coverage ratio 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair value but do not impact earnings or cash flow 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flow 
we do not believe a one percentage point change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair market value of our fixed rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact for one year based upon the amounts outstanding at december  under our variable rate revolving credit facility for each one percentage point change in interest rates would be approximately  per annum 
we do not presently undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and we are not party to any interest rate risk management transactions
