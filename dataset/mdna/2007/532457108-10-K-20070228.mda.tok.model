item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive overview this section provides an overview of our financial results  significant business development  recent product and late stage pipeline developments  and legal and governmental matters affecting our company and the pharmaceutical industry 
financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent  primarily as a result of strong growth of our newer products 
we increased our investment in marketing expenses in support of key products  primarily cymbalta and diabetes care products  and continued our commitment to research and development  investing approximately percent of our sales during our results also benefited from continued growth in profitability of the lilly icos joint venture as well as cost containment and productivity initiatives 
net income was billion  or per share  in as compared with billion  or per share  in  representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of percent 
net income comparisons between and are affected by the impact of the following significant items that are reflected in our financial results see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we recognized asset impairments  restructuring and other special charges of million pretax in the fourth quarter  which decreased earnings per share by 
note 
in the fourth quarter  we incurred a charge related to zyprexa product liability litigation matters of million pretax  or 
per share notes and 
we incurred a charge related to product liability litigation matters  primarily related to zyprexa  of billion pretax  which decreased earnings per share by 
in the second quarter of notes and 
we recognized asset impairments and other special charges of million pretax in the fourth quarter  which decreased earnings per share by 
note 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 in the fourth quarter of the adoption of fin resulted in an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million after tax  which decreased earnings per share by 
note 
graph business development  and recent product and late stage pipeline developments our long term success depends  to a great extent  on our ability to continue to discover and develop innovative pharmaceutical products and acquire or collaborate on compounds currently in development by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies 
we have achieved a number of successes with recent product launches and late stage pipeline developments  including on january   we completed the acquisition of icos corporation for approximately billion in cash 
the acquisition brings the full value of cialis to us and enables us to realize operational efficiencies in the further development  marketing and selling of this product 
the allocation of the purchase price has not yet been completed  however  we anticipate that the one time charge to earnings for acquired in process research and development ipr d will approximate million no tax benefit note 
in november  we received european commission authorization to market byetta as a treatment for type diabetes with our partner  amylin pharmaceuticals  inc amylin 
in addition  in december  we received approval from the us food and drug administration fda for byetta as an add on therapy to improve blood sugar control in people with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate control on a thiazolidinedione tzd 
we submitted a new drug application nda to the fda for evista for the reduction in risk of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and postmenopausal women at high risk for breast cancer 
we initiated a phase iii clinical trial to study enzastaurin as a maintenance therapy to prevent relapse in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
additionally  we closed the enrollment of a phase iii study of enzastaurin for the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma after an external data monitoring committee determined the study would likely not meet its primary efficacy endpoint 
graph in july  we received fda approval for gemzar for the treatment of recurrent ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin 
additionally  the united kingdom s national institute for health and clinical excellence has recommended gemzar coverage under the uk s national health service for the use of gemzar  in combination with paclitaxel  within a limited population of breast cancer patients 
in september  we received an approvable letter from the fda for arxxant tm for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy 
the fda has indicated that it will require efficacy data from an additional phase iii study before it will consider approving the molecule 
we decided to appeal the fda s decision and began discussions with the agency 
there can be no assurance that our appeal will be successful 
we submitted a supplemental nda to the fda for cymbalta for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder 
we are also conducting phase iii studies on cymbalta for the treatment of fibromyalgia  a chronic  often debilitating pain disorder 
in january  we licensed from osi pharmaceuticals  inc osi  its glucokinase activator gka program for the treatment of type diabetes  including the lead compound psn we received an exclusive license to develop and market any compounds derived from the gka program 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid an upfront fee of million pretax note 
in january  along with our partner  daiichi sankyo  we announced that we completed enrollment in the triton study  a phase iii head to head study comparing prasugrel to clopidogrel plavix in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention pci 
legal and governmental matters in december  the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed a district court ruling upholding the validity of our zyprexa patent 
we are very confident we will maintain our us patent protection on zyprexa until we have reached agreements with claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a total of approximately  claims against us relating to the medication 
approximately  claims remain 
as a result of our product liability exposures  the substantial majority of which were related to zyprexa  we recorded net pretax charges of billion in the second quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of in march  we were notified by the us attorney s office for the eastern district of pennsylvania that it had commenced a civil investigation relating to our us marketing and promotional practices 
in the united states  implementation of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of mma  which provides a prescription drug benefit under the medicare program  took effect january  in  we experienced a one time sales benefit as a result of mma  however  in the long term there is additional risk of increased pricing pressures 
while the mma prohibits the secretary of health and human services hhs from directly negotiating prescription drug prices with manufacturers  legislation was passed in early by the us house of representatives that would require hhs to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this legislation will be considered by the us senate 
mma retains the authority of the secretary of hhs to prohibit the importation of prescription drugs 
legislation to allow for broad scale importation has been presented to both the house of representatives and the senate 
the proposed legislation could remove that authority and allow for the importation of products into the us if adopted  such legislation would likely have a negative effect on our us sales 
current importation language allows for medication to be carried in person from canada to the us and does not authorize mail or internet importation 
further  the language disallows certain medications including injectibles 
we believe the expanded prescription drug coverage for seniors under the mma has further alleviated the perceived need for a federal importation scheme 
however  notwithstanding the federal law that continues to prohibit all but the very narrow drug importation detailed above  several states have implemented importation schemes for their citizens  usually involving a website that links patients to selected canadian pharmacies 
the successful implementation of the mma may relieve some state budget pressures but is unlikely to result in reduced pricing pressures at the state level 
a majority of states have implemented supplemental rebates and restricted formularies in their medicaid programs  and these programs are expected to continue in the post mma environment 
moreover  under the federal deficit reduction act  states will have greater flexibility to impose new cost sharing requirements on medicaid beneficiaries for non preferred prescription drugs that will result in certain beneficiaries bearing more of the cost 
several states also are attempting to extend discounted medicaid prices to non medicaid patients 
as a result  we expect pressures on pharmaceutical pricing to continue 
as it relates to the medicare program  lilly has implemented the lillymedicareanswers program 
lilly medicareanswers is a new patient assistance program that provides certain eligible medicare part d enrolled patients access to a one month s supply of select medications for a administrative fee per prescription 
medications available via the program include zyprexa  forteo  and humatrope 
international operations also are generally subject to extensive price and market regulations  and there are many proposals for additional cost containment measures  including proposals that would directly or indirectly impose additional price controls or reduce the value of our intellectual property protection 
operating results sales our worldwide sales for increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta  forteo  byetta  zyprexa  and alimta 
worldwide sales volume increased percent and selling prices increased sales by percent 
foreign exchange rates did not impact our overall sales growth 
sales in the us increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta  diabetes care products  forteo  and zyprexa 
us growth comparisons benefited from an estimated million of wholesaler destocking that had occurred in as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in the first quarter of additionally  we experienced a one time sales benefit resulting from a shift of certain low income patients from medicaid to medicare and increased access to medical coverage by certain patients previously covered under our lillyanswers program following the implementation of mma in this contributed part of the increases in us net effective sales prices of percent 
sales outside the us increased percent  to billion  driven by growth of cymbalta  alimta  and zyprexa 
zyprexa  our top selling product  is a treatment for schizophrenia  bipolar mania  and bipolar maintenance 
zyprexa sales in the us increased percent in  driven by higher prices  offset in part by lower demand 
the increase in net effective selling prices was partially due to the transition of certain low income patients from medicaid to medicare 
sales outside the us increased percent  driven primarily by increased demand  offset in part by declining prices 
the following table summarizes our net sales activity in compared with year ended year ended percent december  december  change product us outside us total total from dollars in millions zyprexa gemzar cymbalta humalog evista humulin animal health products alimta forteo strattera actos humatrope fluoxetine products reopro anti infectives byetta nm cialis xigris other pharmaceutical products total net sales nm not meaningful us sales include sales in puerto rico 
cialis had worldwide sales of million  representing an increase of percent compared with the sales shown in the table above represent results only in the territories in which we market cialis exclusively 
the remaining sales relate to the joint venture territories of lilly icos llc north america  excluding puerto rico  and europe 
our share of the joint venture territory sales  net of expenses and income taxes  is reported in other income net in our consolidated statements of income 
diabetes care products  composed primarily of humalog  our insulin analog  humulin  a biosynthetic human insulin  actos  an oral agent for the treatment of type diabetes  and byetta  the first in a new class of medicines known as incretin mimetics for type diabetes that we market with amylin  had aggregate worldwide revenues of billion in  an increase of percent 
diabetes care revenues in the us increased percent  to billion 
diabetes care revenues outside the us increased percent  to billion 
results from our primary diabetes care products are as follows humalog sales increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices and increased percent outside the us  due primarily to increased volume  offset partially by lower prices 
humulin sales in the us decreased percent due primarily to decreased volume  offset partially by increased selling prices 
outside the us  humulin sales decreased percent due to decreases in demand and selling prices 
actos revenues in the us  the majority of which represent service revenues from a copromotion agreement in the us with takeda pharmaceuticals north america takeda  decreased percent in actos is manufactured by takeda chemical industries  ltd  and sold in the us by takeda 
our us marketing rights with respect to actos expired in september  however  we will continue receiving royalties from takeda 
as a result  our revenues from actos will decline each year through september our arrangement outside the us continues 
sales outside the us increased percent  due primarily to increased volume in addition to a favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  offset in part by lower prices 
sales of byetta  launched in the us in june  were million for we report as revenue our percent share of byetta s gross margin and our sales of byetta pen delivery devices to amylin 
sales of gemzar  a product approved to fight various cancers  increased percent in the us  due primarily to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in gemzar sales increased percent outside the us  driven by strong volume 
sales of cymbalta  a product for the treatment of major depressive disorder and diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain  increased percent in the us  due to strong demand 
sales of cymbalta outside the us reflect international launches 
worldwide sales exceeded billion in  the product s second full year on the market 
sales of evista  a product for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis  increased percent in the us due to higher prices  offset partially by a decline in demand 
outside the us  sales of evista decreased percent  driven by lower prices  offset by an increase in demand 
sales of alimta  a treatment for malignant pleural mesothelioma and second line treatment for non smallcell lung cancer nsclc  increased percent and percent in the us and outside the us  respectively  due primarily to increased demand 
sales of forteo  a treatment for severe osteoporosis  increased percent in the us in addition to increased demand  us sales significantly benefited from patients access to medical coverage through the medicare part d program and from decreased utilization of our us patient assistance program  lillyanswers 
sales outside the us increased percent  reflecting a strong demand 
sales of strattera  a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children  adolescents  and adults  increased percent in the us due to higher prices as well as the reductions in us wholesaler inventory levels in  offset by a decline in demand 
sales outside the us increased percent due primarily to increased demand in addition to a modest favorable impact of foreign exchange rates  offset partially by lower prices 
total product sales of cialis  an erectile dysfunction treatment  increased percent in the us and percent outside the us worldwide cialis sales growth reflects the impact of market share gains  market growth  and price increases during cialis sales in our territories are reported in net sales  while our percent share of the joint venture net income is reported in other income net 
all sales of cialis subsequent to the icos acquisition in will be included in our revenue 
animal health product sales in the us increased percent  due primarily to increased demand led by rumensin and tylan 
sales outside the us decreased percent  driven primarily by the decrease in the sales of surmax as a result of the european union s growth promotion use ban on the product  effective january  gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin increased to percent of sales compared with percent for this increase was primarily due to increased product prices and increased production volume  partially offset by higher manufacturing expenses 
operating expenses the aggregate of research and development and marketing and administrative expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  primarily due to increases in discovery research and clinical trial costs 
we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately percent of our sales into research and development during marketing and administrative expenses increased percent in  to billion 
this increase was largely attributable to increased marketing expenses in support of key products  primarily cymbalta and the diabetes care franchise  and an increase in litigation related costs 
other income net decreased million  to million  and consists of interest expense  interest income  the after tax operating results of the lilly icos joint venture  and all other miscellaneous income and expense items 
interest expense for increased million  to million 
this increase is a result of higher interest rates and less capitalized interest due to the completion in late of certain manufacturing facilities 
interest income for increased million  to million  due to higher short term interest rates 
the lilly icos joint venture income was million in as compared to million in the increase was due to increased cialis sales and decreased selling and marketing expenses 
net other miscellaneous income items decreased million to million  primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicensing of legacy products and partnered compounds in development 
we incurred tax expense of million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent  compared with percent for the effective tax rates for and were affected primarily by the product liability charges of million and billion  respectively 
the tax expense of these charges was less than our effective tax rate  as the tax expense was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
operating results financial results we achieved worldwide sales growth of percent  due in part to the launch in of five new products as well as six new indications or formulations for expanded use of new and existing products in key markets 
in addition  we launched one new product in the us and several new products  new indications  or new formulations in key markets in we continued our substantial investments in our manufacturing operations and research and development activities  resulting in cost of products sold and research and development costs increasing at rates greater than sales 
despite product launch expenditures  our cost containment and productivity measures contributed to marketing and administrative expenses increasing at a rate less than sales 
during  we began to expense stock options  which had the effect of increasing our research and development and marketing and administrative expenses 
we also benefited from an increase in other income net  due primarily to increased profitability of the lilly icos joint venture  and a decrease in the tax rate in net income was billion  or per share  in as compared with billion  or per share  in  representing an increase in net income and earnings per share of percent 
certain items  reflected in our operating results for and  should be considered in comparing the two years 
the significant items for are summarized in the executive overview 
the items are summarized as follows see notes     and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information in  we began to expense stock options in accordance with sfas r 
had we expensed stock options in  our net income would have been lower by million  which would have decreased earnings per share by 
per share notes and 
we recognized asset impairment charges  streamlined our infrastructure  and provided for the anticipated resolution of the government investigation of evista marketing and promotional practices  resulting in charges of million pretax in the second quarter of and million pretax in the fourth quarter of  which decreased earnings per share by 
and  respectively note 
we incurred charges for acquired in process research and development ipr d of million no tax benefit in the first quarter of related to the acquisition of applied molecular evolution  inc ame  and million pretax in the fourth quarter of related to our acquisition of a phase i compound under development as a potential treatment for insomnia  which decreased earnings per share by 
in the first quarter of and 
in the fourth quarter of note 
we recognized tax expenses of million in the fourth quarter of associated with the anticipated repatriation in of billion of our earnings reinvested outside the us  as a result of the passage of the american jobs creation act of ajca 
this tax expense decreased earnings per share by 
in that quarter note 
sales our worldwide sales for increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by sales growth of cymbalta  alimta  forteo  and gemzar 
as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early  reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera  prozac  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately million 
sales growth in was also affected by decreased us demand for zyprexa  strattera  and prozac 
despite this wholesaler destocking and decreased demand  sales in the us increased percent  to billion  driven primarily by increased sales of cymbalta and alimta 
sales outside the us increased percent  to billion  driven by growth of zyprexa  alimta  and gemzar 
worldwide sales reflected a volume increase of percent  with global selling prices contributing percent and an increase due to favorable changes in exchange rates contributing percent

our share of the joint venture territory sales  net of expenses and income taxes  is reported in other income net in our consolidated statements of income 
zyprexa sales in the us decreased percent in  resulting from a decline in underlying demand due to continuing competitive pressures 
sales outside the us in increased percent  driven by volume growth in a number of major markets and the favorable impact of exchange rates 
excluding the impact of exchange rates  sales of zyprexa outside the us increased by percent 
diabetes care products had aggregate worldwide revenues of billion in  an increase of percent 
diabetes care revenues in the us increased percent  to billion  primarily driven by higher prices  offset partially by a decline in underlying demand due to continued competitive pressures in the insulins market and reductions in wholesaler inventory levels of insulins 
diabetes care revenues outside the us increased percent  to billion 
humalog sales increased percent in the us and percent outside the us humulin sales in the us decreased percent  while humulin sales outside the us increased percent 
actos revenues increased percent in sales of byetta were million following its june launch 
our reported net sales of byetta totaled million in sales of gemzar increased percent in the us in and were negatively affected by reductions in wholesaler inventory levels as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers 
gemzar sales increased percent outside the us  driven by strong volume growth in a number of cancer indications 
sales of evista decreased percent in the us due to declines in us underlying demand resulting from continued competitive pressures and to reductions in wholesaler inventory levels 
this decline was partially offset by price increases 
outside the us  sales of evista increased percent  driven by volume growth in several markets and the early launch of the product in japan 
cymbalta was launched in the us in late august for the treatment of major depressive disorder and in september for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathic pain 
cymbalta launches began in europe for the treatment of major depressive disorder during the first quarter of cymbalta generated million in sales in sales of strattera declined percent in the us in due to wholesaler destocking resulting from restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers and a decline in underlying demand 
sales outside the us were million in  compared with million in  primarily reflecting launches in australia  canada  germany  mexico  and spain 
alimta was launched in the us in february for the treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and in august for second line treatment of non smallcell lung cancer nsclc 
alimta was launched in several european countries in the second half of and throughout alimta generated sales of million in forteo increased percent in the us in  driven by strong growth in underlying demand 
sales growth was offset  in part  by wholesaler destocking in the first half of related to our revised arrangements with us wholesalers 
cialis worldwide sales of million in reflected an increase of percent compared to  and comprises million of sales in our territories  and million of sales in the joint venture territories 
within the joint venture territories  us sales of cialis were million for  an increase of percent  despite wholesaler destocking in the first half of the year as a result of our restructured arrangements with our us wholesalers 
animal health product sales in the us increased percent  while sales outside the us increased percent  led by rumensin and paylean 
gross margin  costs  and expenses the gross margin decreased to percent of sales compared with percent for the decrease was primarily due to higher manufacturing expenses  partially offset by favorable product mix and lower factory inventory losses 
operating expenses increased percent in investment in research and development increased percent  to billion  in  due to the adoption of stock option expensing in  decreased reimbursements from collaboration partners  and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses 
we continued to be a leader in our industry peer group by investing approximately percent of our sales into research and development during marketing and administrative expenses increased percent in  to billion  due to the adoption of stock option expensing in  and increased incentive compensation and benefits expenses 
this comparison also benefited from a charitable contribution to the lilly foundation during the fourth quarter of research and development expenses would have increased by percent  and marketing and administrative expenses would have been flat for  if had been restated as if stock options had been expensed 
other income net increased million in  to million  due to the following interest expense for increased million  to million  primarily due to increased interest rates 
interest income for increased million  to million  due to increased investment balances and interest rates 
our net income from the lilly icos joint venture was million for  compared with a net loss of million in the joint venture became profitable for the first time in the third quarter of net other miscellaneous income items decreased million to million  primarily as a result of less income related to the outlicense of legacy products and partnered products in development 
the effective tax rate for was percent  compared with percent for the effective tax rate for was affected by the product liability charge of billion 
the tax benefit of this charge was less than our effective tax rate  as the tax benefit was calculated based upon existing tax laws in the countries in which we reasonably expect to deduct the charge 
the effective tax rate for was affected by the tax provision related to the expected repatriation of billion of earnings reinvested outside the us pursuant to the ajca and the charge for acquired ipr d related to the ame acquisition  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
financial condition as of december   cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments totaled billion compared with billion at december  strong cash flow from operations in of billion was more than offset by repayments of long term debt of billion  dividends paid of billion  and capital expenditures of billion 
capital expenditures of billion during were million less than in  due primarily to the management of capital spending and completion of key projects 
we expect near term capital expenditures to remain approximately the same as levels while we invest in our biotech and research and development initiatives  continue to upgrade our manufacturing facilities to enhance productivity and quality systems  and invest in the long term growth of our diabetes care products 
total debt as of december  was billion  reflecting a net repayment of billion during in early  we issued approximately billion of debt to finance our acquisition of icos  including the acquisition of icos stock and refinancing of icos debt 
our current debt ratings from standard poor s and moody s remain at aa and aa  respectively 
dividends of per share were paid in  an increase of percent from in the fourth quarter of  effective for the first quarter dividend in  the quarterly dividend was increased to 
per share a percent increase  resulting in an indicated annual rate for of per share 
the year was the nd consecutive year in which we made dividend payments and the th consecutive year in which dividends have been increased 
we believe that cash generated from operations  along with available cash and cash equivalents  will be sufficient to fund our normal operating needs  including debt service  capital expenditures  costs associated with product liability litigation  dividends  and taxes in we believe that amounts available through our existing commercial paper program should be adequate to fund maturities of short term borrowings  if necessary 
we currently have billion of unused committed bank credit facilities  billion of which backs our commercial paper program 
excluding the longterm debt issued for the icos acquisition  we plan to use available cash to repay approximately billion of debt outside the us by the end of various risks and uncertainties  including those discussed in the financial expectations for section  may affect our operating results and cash generated from operations 
bar chart in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and currency values 
these fluctuations can vary the costs of financing  investing  and operating 
we address a portion of these risks through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
the objective of controlling these risks is to limit the impact on earnings of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates 
all derivative activities are for purposes other than trading 
our primary interest rate risk exposure results from changes in short term us dollar interest rates 
in an effort to manage interest rate exposures  we strive to achieve an acceptable balance between fixed and floating rate debt positions and may enter into interest rate derivatives to help maintain that balance 
based on our overall interest rate exposure at december  and  including derivatives and other interest rate risk sensitive instruments  a hypothetical percent change in interest rates applied to the fair value of the instruments as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of interest rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
our foreign currency risk exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro and the japanese yen 
we face transactional currency exposures that arise when we enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than the local currency 
we also face currency exposure that arises from translating the results of our global operations to the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
we use forward contracts and purchased options to manage our foreign currency exposures 
our policy outlines the minimum and maximum hedge coverage of such exposures 
gains and losses on these derivative positions offset  in part  the impact of currency fluctuations on the existing assets  liabilities  commitments  and anticipated revenues 
considering our derivative financial instruments outstanding at december  and  a hypothetical percent change in exchange rates primarily against the us dollar as of december  and  respectively  would have no material impact on earnings  cash flows  or fair values of foreign currency rate risk sensitive instruments over a one year period 
these calculations do not reflect the impact of the exchange gains or losses on the underlying positions that would be offset  in part  by the results of the derivative instruments 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by the appropriate regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
our current noncancelable contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet other total our long term debt obligations include both our expected principal and interest obligations and our interest rate swaps 
we used the interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the amount of the contractual obligation for interest on the variable rate debt instruments and swaps 
we have included the following purchase obligations  consisting primarily of all open purchase orders at our significant operating locations as of december  some of these purchase orders may be cancelable  however  for purposes of this disclosure  we have not distinguished between cancelable and noncancelable purchase obligations 
contractual payment obligations with each of our significant vendors  which are noncancelable and are not contingent 
we have included our long term liabilities consisting primarily of our nonqualified supplemental pension funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
this category comprises primarily minimum pension funding requirements 
individually  these arrangements are not material in any one reporting period 
however  if milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements would happen to be reached in the same reporting period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development makes it unlikely that this will occur  as the failure rate for products in development is very high 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
the contractual obligations table is current as of december  the amount of these obligations can be expected to change materially over time as new contracts are initiated and existing contracts are completed  terminated  or modified 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  it is possible that other people applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different estimates 
we believe that  given current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable judgment would cause a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity for the periods presented in this report 
our most critical accounting policies have been discussed with our audit committee and are described below 
revenue recognition and sales rebate and discount accruals we recognize revenue from sales of products at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
for more than percent of our sales  this is at the time products are shipped to the customer  typically a wholesale distributor or a major retail chain 
the remaining sales are recorded at the point of delivery 
provisions for discounts and rebates are established in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products sold to major wholesalers in the us and in major markets outside the us  primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products  or alternative approaches 
we attempt to maintain wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio 
causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product supply issues  weather patterns  anticipated changes in the transportation network  redundant holiday stocking  and changes in wholesaler business operations 
an unusual buying pattern compared with underlying demand of our products outside the us could also be the result of speculative buying by wholesalers in anticipation of price increases 
when we believe wholesaler purchasing patterns have caused an unusual increase or decrease in the sales of a major product compared with underlying demand  we disclose this in our product sales discussion if the amount is believed to be material to the product sales trend  however  we are not always able to accurately quantify the amount of stocking or destocking 
as a result of restructuring our arrangements with our us wholesalers in early  reductions occurred in wholesaler inventory levels for certain products primarily strattera  prozac  and gemzar that reduced our sales by approximately million 
the modified structure eliminates the incentive for speculative wholesaler buying and provides us improved data on inventory levels at our us wholesalers 
wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns  which have been approximately percent of our net sales over the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percent of sales 
we establish sales rebate and discount accruals in the same period as the related sales 
the rebate discount amounts are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales 
sales rebates discounts that require the use of judgment in the establishment of the accrual include medicaid  managed care  medicare  chargebacks  long term care  hospital  discount card programs  and various other government programs 
we base these accruals primarily upon our historical rebate discount payments made to our customer segment groups and the provisions of current rebate discount contracts 
we calculate these rebates discounts based upon a percentage of our sales for each of our products as defined by the statutory rates and the contracts with our various customer groups 
the largest of our sales rebate discount amounts are rebates associated with sales covered by medicaid 
although we accrue a liability for medicaid rebates at the time we record the sale when the product is shipped  the medicaid rebate related to that sale is typically billed up to six months later 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount  we consider our historical medicaid rebate payments by product as a percentage of our historical sales as well as any significant changes in sales trends  an evaluation of the current medicaid rebate laws and interpretations  the percentage of our products that are sold to medicaid recipients  and our product pricing and current rebate discount contracts 
most of our rebates outside the us are contractual or legislatively mandated and are estimated and recognized in the same period as the related sales 
in some large european countries  government rebates are based on the anticipated pharmaceutical budget deficit in the country 
a best estimate of these rebates  updated as governmental authorities revise budgeted deficits  is recognized in the same period as the related sale 
if our estimates are not reflective of the actual pharmaceutical budget deficit  we adjust our rebate reserves 
we believe that our accruals for sales rebates and discounts are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
federally mandated medicaid rebate and state pharmaceutical assistance programs medicaid and medicare rebates reduced sales by million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
a percent change in the medicaid and medicare rebate amounts we recognized in would lead to an approximate million effect on our income before income taxes 
as of december   our medicaid and medicare rebate liability was million 
approximately percent and percent of our global rebate and discount liability resulted from sales of our products in the us as of december  and  respectively 
the following represents a roll forward of our most significant us rebate and discount liability balances  including medicaid in millions rebate and discount liability  beginning of year reduction of net sales due to discounts and rebates cash payments of discounts and rebates rebate and discount liability  end of year adjustments of the estimates for these rebates and discounts to actual results were less than percent of net sales for each of the years presented 
product litigation liabilities and other contingencies product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are  by their nature  uncertain and are based upon complex judgments and probabilities 
the factors we consider in developing our product litigation liability reserves and other contingent liability amounts include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation  the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases  the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation  and the likelihood of settlement and current state of settlement discussions  if any 
in addition  we accrue for certain product liability claims incurred  but not filed  to the extent we can formulate a reasonable estimate of their costs 
we estimate these expenses based primarily on historical claims experience and data regarding product usage 
we accrue legal defense costs expected to be incurred in connection with significant product liability contingencies when probable and reasonably estimable 
we also consider the insurance coverage we have to diminish the exposure for periods covered by insurance 
in assessing our insurance coverage  we consider the policy coverage limits and exclusions  the potential for denial of coverage by the insurance company  the financial position of the insurers  and the possibility of and the length of time for collection 
the litigation accruals and environmental liabilities and the related estimated insurance recoverables have been reflected on a gross basis as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that the accruals and related insurance recoveries we have established for product litigation liabilities and other contingencies are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
pension and retiree medical plan assumptions pension benefit costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  and expected return on plan assets 
retiree medical plan costs include assumptions for the discount rate  retirement age  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
these assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
in addition to the analysis below  see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our retirement benefits 
periodically  we evaluate the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets in our defined benefit pension and retiree health benefit plans 
in evaluating these assumptions  we consider many factors  including an evaluation of the discount rates  expected return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rates of other companies  our historical assumptions compared with actual results  an analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations approximately percent to percent of which are growth investments  and the views of leading financial advisers and economists 
we use an actuarially determined  company specific yield curve to determine the discount rate 
in evaluating our expected retirement age assumption  we consider the retirement ages of our past employees eligible for pension and medical benefits together with our expectations of future retirement ages 
we believe our pension and retiree medical plan assumptions are appropriate based upon the above factors 
if the health care cost trend rates were to be increased by one percentage point each future year  the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost components of the annual expense would increase by approximately million 
a one percentage point decrease would decrease the aggregate of the service cost and interest cost by approximately million 
if the discount rate for were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
if the expected return on plan assets for were to be changed by a quarter percentage point  income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
if our assumption regarding the expected age of future retirees for were adjusted by one year  our income before income taxes would be affected by approximately million 
impairment of long lived assets we review the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment on a periodic basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment is determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
the estimated future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
income taxes we prepare and file tax returns based on our interpretation of tax laws and regulations and record estimates based on these judgments and interpretations 
in the normal course of business  our tax returns are subject to examination by various taxing authorities  which may result in future tax and interest assessments by these authorities 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law resulting from legislation  regulation and or as concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
we record a liability for tax contingencies when we believe it is probable that we will be assessed and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
the tax contingency reserve is adjusted for changes in facts and circumstances and additional uncertainties 
for example  adjustments could result from significant amendments to existing tax law and the issuance of regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe that our estimates for tax contingency reserves are appropriate and sufficient to pay assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we have recorded valuation allowances against certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily those that have been generated from net operating losses in certain taxing jurisdictions 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income or tax planning strategies in the jurisdictions associated with these carry forwards where history does not support such an assumption 
implementation of tax planning strategies to recover these deferred tax assets or future income generation in these jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and a reduction of income tax expense 
we believe that our estimates for the valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a percent change in the valuation allowance would result in a change in net income of approximately million 
financial expectations for for the full year of  we expect earnings per share to be in the range of to 
this guidance includes the estimated 
per share dilutive impact of the icos acquisition related to the incremental interest expense on debt used to finance the acquisition  the amortization of icos intangibles and other integration costs 
a disproportionate amount of this dilution is expected to be incurred in the first half of the year 
this guidance also includes the ipr d charges related to the icos acquisition and the in licensing of a diabetes compound from osi  together estimated to be a total of 
per share as discussed in note  as well as additional restructuring and other special charges as discussed in note  estimated to be 
per share 
we expect sales to grow in the high single or low double digits  impacted favorably by the inclusion of all cialis revenue subsequent to the acquisition 
gross margins as a percent of sales are expected to improve slightly compared with in addition  we expect operating expenses to grow in the low double digits  driven primarily by the inclusion of all cialis operating expenses subsequent to the acquisition and increased marketing and selling expenses in support of cymbalta  zyprexa  and the diabetes care franchise  as well as ongoing investment in research and development that will continue to place lilly among the industry leaders in terms of research and development as a percent of sales 
we also expect other income net to contribute less than million  a reduction from due to the removal of the lilly icos joint venture after tax profit 
other income will primarily include net interest income and income from the partnering and out licensing of molecules 
in terms of cash flow  we expect a continuation of strong cash flow trends in  with capital expenditures of approximately billion 
actual results could differ materially and will depend on  among other things  the continuing growth of our currently marketed products  developments with competitive products  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals and the success of our new product launches  asset impairments  restructurings  and acquisitions of compounds under development resulting in acquired in process research and development charges  foreign exchange rates  wholesaler inventory changes  other regulatory developments  litigation and government investigations  and the impact of governmental actions regarding pricing  importation  and reimbursement for pharmaceuticals 
we undertake no duty to update these forward looking statements 
legal and regulatory matters we are a party to various legal actions and government investigations 
the most significant of these are described below 
while it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of these matters  we believe that  except as specifically noted below  the resolution of all such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  but could possibly be material to our consolidated results of operations in any one accounting period 
patent litigation we are engaged in the following patent litigation matters brought pursuant to procedures set out in the hatch waxman act the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of dr

we filed lawsuits against these companies in the us district court for the southern district of indiana  seeking a ruling that the patent is valid  enforceable and being infringed 
the district court ruled in our favor on all counts on april   and on december   that ruling was upheld by the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
reddy and teva are seeking a review of that decision 
we are confident reddy s and teva s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail 
an unfavorable outcome would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
barr laboratories  inc barr  submitted an anda in seeking permission to market a generic version of evista prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents expiring in and alleging that these patents are invalid  not enforceable  or not infringed

teva has also submitted an anda seeking permission to market a generic version of evista 
in june  we filed a lawsuit against teva in the us district court for the southern district of indiana  seeking a ruling that our relevant us patents are valid  enforceable  and being infringed by teva 
no trial date has been set in either case 
we believe barr s and teva s claims are without merit and we expect to prevail 
however  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation  and accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
sicor pharmaceuticals  inc sicor  a subsidiary of teva  submitted andas in november seeking permission to market generic versions of gemzar prior to the expiration of our relevant us patents expiring in and  and alleging that these patents are invalid 
in february  we filed a lawsuit against sicor in the us district court for the southern district of indiana  seeking a ruling that these patents are valid and are being infringed by sicor 
in response to our lawsuit  sicor filed a declaratory judgment action in the us district court for the central district of california 
sicor also moved to dismiss our lawsuit in indiana  asserting the indiana court lacks jurisdiction 
the california action has been dismissed 
in september  we received notice that mayne pharma usa inc mayne filed a similar anda for gemzar 
in october  we filed a lawsuit against mayne in the southern district of indiana in response to the anda filing 
in response to our lawsuit  mayne filed a motion to our lawsuit  asserting the indiana court lacks jurisdiction 
in october  we received notice that sun pharmaceutical industries inc sun filed an anda for gemzar  alleging that the patent is invalid 
in december  we filed a lawsuit against sun in the southern district of indiana in response to sun s anda filing 
we expect to prevail in litigation involving our gemzar patents and believe that claims made by these generic companies that our patents are not valid are without merit 
however  it is not possible to predict or determine the outcome of this litigation  and accordingly  we can provide no assurance that we will prevail 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
in june  we were sued by ariad pharmaceuticals  inc  the massachusetts institute of technology  the whitehead institute for biomedical research and the president and fellows of harvard college in the us district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that sales of two of our products  xigris and evista  were inducing the infringement of a patent related to the discovery of a natural cell signaling phenomenon in the human body  and seeking royalties on past and future sales of these products 
in june  the united states patent and trademark office commenced a re examination of the patent in order to consider certain issues raised by us relating to the validity of the patent 
on may   a jury in boston issued an initial decision in the case that xigris and evista sales infringe the patent 
the jury awarded the plaintiffs approximately million in damages  calculated by applying a percent royalty to all us sales of xigris and evista from the date of issuance of the patent through the date of trial 
we are seeking to have the jury verdict overturned by the trial court judge  and if unsuccessful  will appeal the decision to the court of appeals for the federal circuit 
in addition  a separate bench trial with the us district court of massachusetts was held the week of august   on our contention that the patent is unenforceable and impermissibly covers natural processes 
no decision has been rendered 
we believe that these allegations are without legal merit  that we will ultimately prevail on these issues and therefore that the likelihood of any monetary damages is remote 
government investigations in march  the office of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania advised us that it had commenced a civil investigation related to our us marketing and promotional practices  including our communications with physicians and remuneration of physician consultants and advisors  with respect to zyprexa  prozac  and prozac weekly tm 
in october  the us attorney s office advised that it is also conducting an inquiry regarding certain rebate agreements we entered into with a pharmacy benefit manager covering axid  evista  humalog  humulin  prozac  and zyprexa 
the inquiry includes a review of lilly s medicaid best price reporting related to the product sales covered by the rebate agreements 
we are cooperating with the us attorney in these investigations  including providing a broad range of documents and information relating to the investigations 
in june  we received a subpoena from the office of the attorney general  medicaid fraud control unit  of the state of florida  seeking production of documents relating to sales of zyprexa and our marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa 
in september  we received a subpoena from the california attorney general s office seeking production of documents related to our efforts to obtain and maintain zyprexa s status on california s formulary  marketing and promotional practices with respect to zyprexa  and remuneration of health care providers 
beginning in august  we have received civil investigative demands or subpoenas from the attorneys general of a number of states 
most of these requests are now part of a multistate investigative effort being coordinated by an executive committee of attorneys general 
we are aware that states are participating in this joint effort  and we anticipate that additional states will join the investigation 
these attorneys general are seeking a broad range of zyprexa documents  including documents relating to sales  marketing and promotional practices  and remuneration of health care providers 
it is possible that other lilly products could become subject to investigation and that the outcome of these matters could include criminal charges and fines  penalties  or other monetary or nonmonetary remedies 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from an adverse outcome 
it is possible  however  that an adverse outcome could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
we have implemented and continue to review and enhance a broadly based compliance program that includes comprehensive compliance related activities designed to ensure that our marketing and promotional practices  physician communications  remuneration of health care professionals  managed care arrangements  and medicaid best price reporting comply with applicable laws and regulations 
product liability and related litigation we have been named as a defendant in a large number of zyprexa product liability lawsuits in the united states and have been notified of many other claims of individuals who have not filed suit 
the lawsuits and unfiled claims together the claims allege a variety of injuries from the use of zyprexa  with the majority alleging that the product caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels 
the claims seek substantial compensatory and punitive damages and typically accuse us of inadequately testing for and warning about side effects of zyprexa 
many of the claims also allege that we improperly promoted the drug 
almost all of the federal lawsuits are part of a multi district litigation mdl proceeding before the honorable jack weinstein in the federal district court for the eastern district of new york mdl no 

since june  we have entered into agreements with various claimants attorneys involved in us zyprexa product liability litigation to settle a substantial majority of the claims 
the agreements cover a total of approximately  claimants  including a large number of previously filed lawsuits and other asserted claims 
the two primary settlements were as follows in june  we reached an agreement in principle and in september a final agreement to settle more than  claims for million plus million to cover administration of the settlement 
that settlement is being administered by special settlement masters appointed by judge weinstein 
in january  we reached agreements with a number of plaintiffs attorneys to settle more than  claims for approximately million 
the settlement totaling million was paid during the january settlements were recorded in other current liabilities in our december  consolidated balance sheet and will be paid in the first quarter of the us zyprexa product liability claims not subject to these agreements include approximately lawsuits in the us covering approximately claimants and an additional claims of which we are aware 
in addition  we have been served with a lawsuit seeking class certification in which the members of the purported class are seeking refunds and medical monitoring 
in early  we were served with four lawsuits seeking class action status in canada on behalf of patients who took zyprexa 
one of these four lawsuits has been certified for residents of quebec 
the allegations in the canadian actions are similar to those in the litigation pending in the us we are prepared to continue our vigorous defense of zyprexa in all remaining cases 
we currently anticipate that trials in seven cases in the eastern district of new york will begin in the second quarter of we have insurance coverage for a portion of our zyprexa product liability claims exposure 
the third party insurance carriers have raised defenses to their liability under the policies and are seeking to rescind the policies 
the dispute is now the subject of litigation in the federal court in indianapolis against certain of the carriers and in arbitration in bermuda against other carriers 
while we believe our position has merit  there can be no assurance that we will prevail 
in addition  we have been named as a defendant in numerous other product liability lawsuits involving primarily diethylstilbestrol des and thimerosal 
the majority of these claims are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and coverage limits 
in the second quarter of  we recorded a net pretax charge of billion for product liability matters 
the charge took into account our estimated recoveries from our insurance coverage related to these matters 
the charge covered the following the cost of the june zyprexa settlements described above  and reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the then known and expected product liability claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims 
a substantial majority of those exposures and costs were related to then known and expected zyprexa claims 
as a result of the january settlements discussed above  we incurred a pretax charge of million in the fourth quarter of the charge covered the following the cost of the january zyprexa settlements  and reserves for product liability exposures and defense costs regarding the then known and expected zyprexa product liability claims to the extent we could formulate a reasonable estimate of the probable number and cost of the claims 
in december  we were served with two lawsuits brought in state court in louisiana on behalf of the louisiana department of health and hospitals  alleging that zyprexa caused or contributed to diabetes or high blood glucose levels  and that we improperly promoted the drug 
these cases have been removed to federal court and are now part of the mdl proceedings in the eastern district of new york 
in these actions  the department of health and hospitals seeks to recover the costs it paid for zyprexa through medicaid and other drug benefit programs  as well as the costs the department alleges it has incurred and will incur to treat zyprexa related illnesses 
in  we were served with similar lawsuits filed by the states of alaska  west virginia  new mexico  and mississippi in the courts of the respective states 
in  two lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york purporting to be nationwide class actions on behalf of all consumers and third party payors  excluding governmental entities  which have made or will make payments for their members or insured patients being prescribed zyprexa 
these actions have now been consolidated into a single lawsuit  which is brought under certain state consumer protection statutes  the federal civil rico statute  and common law theories  seeking a refund of the cost of zyprexa  treble damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees 
two additional lawsuits were filed in the eastern district of new york in on similar grounds 
as with the product liability suits  these lawsuits allege that we inadequately tested for and warned about side effects of zyprexa and improperly promoted the drug 
we cannot predict with certainty the additional number of lawsuits and claims that may be asserted 
in addition  although we believe it is probable  there can be no assurance that the january zyprexa product liability settlements described above will be concluded 
the ultimate resolution of zyprexa product liability and related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  liquidity  and financial position 
because of the nature of pharmaceutical products  it is possible that we could become subject to large numbers of product liability and related claims for other products in the future 
in the past few years  we have experienced difficulties in obtaining product liability insurance due to a very restrictive insurance market 
therefore  for substantially all of our currently marketed products  we have been and expect that we will continue to be largely self insured for future product liability losses 
in addition  as noted above  there is no assurance that we will be able to fully collect from our insurance carriers on past claims
