overview of our business the operating revenue of the company s stations is derived primarily from advertising revenue and  to a much lesser extent  from compensation paid by the networks to its affiliated stations for broadcasting network programming 
advertising is sold for placement within and adjoining a station s network and locally originated programming 
advertising is sold in time increments and is priced primarily on the basis of a program s popularity among the specific audience an advertiser desires to reach  as measured principally by periodic audience surveys 
in addition  advertising rates are affected by the number of advertisers competing for the available time  the size and demographic makeup of the market served by the station and the availability of alternative advertising media in the market area 
rates are highest during the most desirable viewing hours  with corresponding reductions during other hours 
the ratings of a local station affiliated with a national television network can be affected by ratings of network programming 
most advertising contracts are short term  and generally run only for a few weeks 
approximately of the gross revenue of the company s stations was generated from local advertising  which is sold by a station s sales staff directly to local accounts 
the remainder of the advertising revenue primarily represents national advertising  which is sold by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  adam young inc ayi  a national advertising sales representative 
the stations generally pay commissions to advertising agencies on local  regional and national advertising 
expenditures by advertisers tend to be cyclical  reflecting overall economic conditions  as well as budgeting and buying patterns 
a decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could alter current or prospective advertisers spending priorities 
this could cause our revenues or operating results to decline significantly in any given period 
the advertising revenue of the company s stations are generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to  and including  the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during even numbered election years due to spending by political candidates  where spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
the stations primary operating expenses are for employee compensation  news gathering  production  programming and promotion costs 
a high proportion of the operating expenses of the stations is fixed 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and if it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
management has determined the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and the related disclosures have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  requires management to make significant judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
the company uses significant estimates in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts  the amortization of programming contracts  the evaluation of intangible assets and pension benefit obligations and costs 
revenue recognition 
as discussed above  the gross operating revenue of the company s stations is derived primarily from advertising revenue  which represented approximately  and of the company s total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
advertising revenues advertising revenues are recognized net of agency commissions and in the period in which the commercial is broadcast 
barter and trade revenues are also included in advertising revenues and are also recognized when the commercials are broadcast 
network compensation five of the company s ten stations are affiliated with abc  three are affiliated with cbs  one is affiliated with nbc and one is affiliated with mynetworktv 
the company recently renewed its affiliations with abc  cbs and nbc 
under the renewed affiliations  the company is receiving significantly less network compensation than it received under the expired agreements 
network compensation from abc  cbs and nbc is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
other revenue the company generates revenue from other sources  which include commercial production  trade shows  rental income from tower space and other miscellaneous revenues 
additionally  included in other revenue is retransmission consent revenue  whereby the company receives consideration from certain satellite and cable providers in return for consent to the retransmission of the signals of the company s television stations 
in some cases  the consideration is based on the number of subscribers receiving the signals 
retransmission consent revenue is generally recognized on a per subscriber basis in accordance with the terms of each contract 
the company expects to recognize approximately million for such retransmission revenue in accounts receivable 
the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt expense 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of specific customer s inability to meets its financial obligations eg bankruptcy filing or as a result in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
concentration of credit risk with respect to accounts receivables is generally limited due to the large number of geographically diverse customers  individually small balance and short payment terms 
experience has been that customer defaults have been consistent with the company s accrual of bad debt expense and that the allowance for doubtful accounts has been adequate to cover the likely exposure to such defaults 
programming 
program rights represent the right to air various forms of existing programming 
program rights and the corresponding contractual obligations are recorded when the license period begins and the program is available for use 
program rights are carried at the lower of unamortized costs or estimated net realizable value 
the company s accounting for long lived program assets requires judgment as to the likelihood that such assets will generate sufficient revenue to cover the associated expense 
many of the company s program commitments are for syndicated shows which are produced by syndicators to be aired on a first run basis 
such shows do not generally stay in production if they do not attract a significant audience 
if the syndicator cancels a show  the company s liability for future payments is eliminated 
accordingly  the company has generally not experienced significant write downs from programming commitments 
intangible assets fcc licenses and network affiliation agreements 
intangible assets include fcc broadcast licenses  network affiliations and other intangible assets 
to assist the company in evaluating our intangible assets  we utilize the service of an independent valuation consulting firm 
fcc licenses are valued using a greenfield income approach 
under this approach  the fcc license is valued by analyzing the estimated after tax discounted future cash flows of the station 
the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow models reflect historical station performance  industry standards and trends in the respective markets 
an analysis of the financial multiples for publicly traded broadcasting companies  as well as a comparable sales analysis of television station sales  was also utilized to confirm the results of the income approach 
the company adopted this methodology to value broadcast licenses as the company believes this methodology has  in recent years  become the methodology generally used within the broadcast industry to value fcc licenses 
if these assumptions decline or if the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow models increases  our intangible assets could be impaired 
an impairment of some or all of the value of these assets could result in a material effect on the consolidated statements of operations 
pension assumptions 
pension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions 
the assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses include discount rates  expected rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  differences between actual results and assumptions are accumulated and amortized as part of net periodic pension costs over future periods  and therefore  generally affect recognized expenses and the recorded obligation in future periods 
the company considers the assumptions used in its determination of its projected benefit obligations and pension expense to be reasonable

in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  provides a framework for measuring fair value under current standards in gaap  and requires additional disclosure about fair value measurements 
in accordance with the statement  the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion  and exchange price is defined as the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or transfer a liability 
if there is a principal market for the asset or liability  the fair value measurement should reflect that price  whether that price is directly observable or otherwise used in a valuation technique 
depending on the asset or liability being valued  the inputs used to determine fair value can range from observable inputs ie prices based on market data independent from the entity and unobservable inputs ie entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use 
the statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

to determine the potential impact  if any  the adoption will have on the company s financial statements
