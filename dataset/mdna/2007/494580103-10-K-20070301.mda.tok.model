all financial and operating data presented in items and reflects the continuing operations of our business for all periods presented unless otherwise indicated 
overview we are a healthcare services company that through our subsidiaries operates hospitals  nursing centers  institutional pharmacies and a contract rehabilitation services business across the united states 
at december   our hospital division operated ltac hospitals with  licensed beds in states 
our health services division operated nursing centers with  licensed beds in states 
we also operated a contract rehabilitation services business that provides rehabilitative services primarily in long term care settings 
our pharmacy division operated an institutional pharmacy business with pharmacies in states and a pharmacy management business servicing substantially all of our hospitals 
on october   we signed a definitive agreement with amerisourcebergen to combine our respective institutional pharmacy businesses  kps and pharmerica ltc  into a new  independent  publicly traded company 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation in recent years  we have completed certain strategic divestitures to improve our future operating results 
for accounting purposes  the operating results of these businesses and the losses associated with these transactions have been classified as discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
assets not sold at december  have been measured at the lower of carrying value or estimated fair value less costs of disposal and have been classified as held for sale in our accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   we completed the rehabilitation services reorganization 
the historical operating results of our nursing center and rehabilitation services segments were not restated to conform with this business realignment 
in april  the board of directors declared a for stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was distributed in may share and per share data for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the stock split 
the operating results of acquired businesses are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations since the respective acquisition dates 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we rely on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenue recognition we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to each of our operating divisions 
these payment arrangements may be based upon prospective rates  reimbursable costs  established charges  discounted charges or per diem payments 
net patient service revenue is reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from medicare  medicaid  other third party payors and individual patients for services rendered 
retroactive adjustments that are likely to result from future examinations by third party payors are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted as necessary in future periods based upon new information or final settlements 
favorable settlements of prior year hospital medicare cost reports aggregated million in  million in and million in in addition  we recorded approximately million of income in and million of income in related to prior year retroactive nursing center medicaid rate increases in indiana and north carolina  respectively 
a summary of revenues by payor type follows in thousands year ended december  medicare medicaid private and other eliminations rehabilitation pharmacy collectibility of accounts receivable accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from the medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients 
estimated provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
in evaluating the collectibility of accounts receivable  we consider a number of factors  including the age of the accounts  changes in collection patterns  the composition of patient accounts by payor type  the status of ongoing disputes with third party payors and general industry conditions 
actual collections of accounts receivable in subsequent periods may require changes in the estimated provision for loss 
changes in these estimates are charged or credited to the results of operations in the period of the change 
the provision for doubtful accounts totaled million for  million for and million for in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million favorable change in estimate related to the provision for doubtful accounts in our pharmacy division 
allowances for insurance risks we insure a substantial portion of our professional liability risks and workers compensation risks through a wholly owned limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
provisions for loss for these risks are based upon independent actuarially determined estimates 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the allowance for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the expected cost to settle reported claims and an amount  based upon past experiences  for losses incurred but not reported 
these liabilities are necessarily based upon estimates and  while management believes that the provision for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
to the extent that subsequent expected ultimate claims costs vary from historical provisions for loss  future earnings will be charged or credited 
provisions for loss for professional liability risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary have been discounted based upon independent actuarial estimates of claim payment patterns using a discount rate of in each of the last three years 
amounts equal to the discounted loss provision are funded annually 
we do not fund the portion of professional liability risks related to estimated claims that have been incurred but not reported 
accordingly  these liabilities are not discounted 
the allowance for professional liability risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  if we did not discount any of the allowances for professional liability risks  these balances would have approximated million at december  and million at december  as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received a return of capital of million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
prior to  we recorded substantial cost increases related to professional liability risks 
a portion of these costs were not funded into our limited purpose insurance subsidiary until the following fiscal year 
based upon actuarially determined estimates  we funded approximately million into our limited purpose insurance subsidiary in to satisfy fiscal funding requirements 
changes in the number of professional liability claims and the cost to settle these claims significantly impact the allowance for professional liability risks 
a relatively small variance between our estimated and ultimate actual number of claims or average cost per claim could have a material impact  either favorable or unfavorable  on the adequacy of the allowance for professional liability risks 
for example  a variance in the allowance for professional liability risks at december  would impact our operating income by approximately million 
the provision for professional liability risks continuing operations  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for changes in estimates for prior year professional liability costs reduced professional liability costs by approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
while we expect that professional liability costs for may be higher than the costs recorded over the last three years  we believe that the annual growth rates for professional liability costs appear to be moderating 
we recorded favorable changes in estimate aggregating million  million and million for  and  respectively  for professional liability reserves related primarily to our former florida and texas nursing centers included in discontinued operations 
provisions for loss for workers compensation risks retained by our limited purpose insurance subsidiary are not discounted and amounts equal to the loss provision are funded annually 
the allowance for workers compensation risks aggregated million at december  and million at december  the provision for workers compensation risks  including the cost of coverage maintained with unaffiliated commercial insurance carriers  aggregated million for  million for and million for see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of taxable income or loss for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences 
table of contents 
index to financial statements between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating and capital loss carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is provided for these deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in november  the irs proposed certain adjustments to our and federal income tax returns which we were contesting 
the principal proposed adjustment related to the manner of reduction of our tax attributes  primarily our net operating loss carryforwards  in connection with the emergence of our subsidiaries and us from proceedings under the bankruptcy code 
in  we reached a settlement with the irs  pending final documentation  related to all disputed federal tax issues for fiscal and in connection with the settlement  we agreed to pay approximately million to the irs in in the fourth quarter of  we reflected the impact of the settlement in our consolidated balance sheet by increasing certain net deferred tax assets by approximately million  reducing currently payable income taxes by approximately million and increasing stockholders equity by approximately million 
because of fresh start accounting rules related to our reorganization in  the settlement of these pre reorganization income tax matters had no impact on earnings in our effective income tax rate was in  in and in we recorded favorable income tax adjustments in related to the resolution of certain income tax contingencies that reduced the provision for income taxes by approximately million 
there are significant uncertainties with respect to capital loss and net operating loss carryforwards which could affect materially the realization of certain deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we have recognized deferred tax assets to the extent it is more likely than not they will be realized and a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets to the extent the realizability of the deferred tax assets is uncertain 
we recognized net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  and million at december  after our emergence from bankruptcy  the realization of pre reorganization deferred tax assets and the resolution of certain income tax contingencies eliminated in full the goodwill recorded in connection with fresh start accounting 
after the fresh start accounting goodwill was eliminated in full  the excess of approximately million in  million in and million in was treated as an increase to capital in excess of par value and a reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
we are subject to various income tax audits at the federal and state levels in the ordinary course of business 
such audits could result in increased tax payments  interest and penalties 
while we believe our tax positions are appropriate  we cannot assure you that the various authorities engaged in the examination of our income tax returns will not challenge our positions 
valuation of long lived assets and goodwill we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets and the related identifiable intangible assets with respect to any events or circumstances that may indicate whether an impairment or an adjustment to the carrying value or amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows  the carrying values of such assets are reduced to fair value 
in assessing the carrying values of long lived assets  we estimate future cash flows at the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
for this purpose  these cash flows are aggregated based upon the contractual agreements underlying the operation of the facility or group of facilities 
generally  an individual facility is considered the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
however  to the extent that groups of facilities are leased under a master lease agreement in which the operations 
table of contents 
index to financial statements of a facility and compliance with the lease terms are interdependent upon other facilities in the agreement including our ability to renew the lease or divest a particular property  we define the group of facilities under a master lease agreement as the lowest level for which there are independent  identifiable cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated cash flows of all facilities within a master lease are aggregated for purposes of evaluating the carrying values of long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform an impairment test for goodwill at least annually or more frequently if adverse events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment test at the end of each year 
no impairment charge was recorded in each of the last three years in connection with our annual impairment test 
our other intangible assets with finite lives are amortized under sfas using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from one to years

sfas requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas also requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position and revises certain disclosure requirements 
the benefit obligation is defined as the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and as the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for any other postretirement benefit plan  such as a retiree healthcare plan

revised sfas r  share based payment  which requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation for interim periods that begin after june  this requirement represents a significant change because stock option awards have not been recognized as compensation expense in our historical consolidated financial statements under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires the cost of an award  based upon fair value on the date of grant  to be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award usually the vesting period 
the fair value of the award on the date of grant will be estimated using option pricing models 
in april  the sec approved a new rule that delayed the effective date of sfas r for public companies until the first annual period  rather than the first interim period  that begins after june  we adopted sfas r on january  and began to recognize compensation expense prospectively in our consolidated financial statements for non vested stock options outstanding at december  and for all future stock option grants 
the adoption of sfas r reduced net income by approximately million for the year ended december  in december  we accelerated the vesting of approximately  unvested stock options awarded to employees and officers which had exercise prices greater than the closing price at december  of per share 
the acceleration of the vesting of these stock options increased the pro forma stock based employee compensation expense in by million million net of income taxes or per diluted share 
the decision to accelerate the vesting of the outstanding underwater stock options was made primarily to reduce compensation expense that otherwise would be recorded in future periods following the adoption of sfas r  to enhance management s focus on increasing shareholder returns and to improve employee morale and retention 
impact of medicare and medicaid reimbursement we depend on reimbursement from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs  for substantially all of our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our total revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs and approximately from private third party payors  such as commercial insurance companies  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and contracted providers 
the medicare and medicaid programs are highly regulated and subject to frequent and substantial changes 
see part i item business governmental regulation for an overview of the reimbursement systems impacting our businesses and part i item a risk factors

index to financial statements the year in review during  we successfully managed through a number of significant challenges and established a strong foundation for future growth 
our most significant accomplishments in include the following our operators managed through unprecedented regulatory changes in each of our operating divisions while improving our level of quality and customer service  we successfully resolved the last remaining issues associated with our reorganization  including the ventas rent reset and the expiration of our warrants  we announced the proposed pharmacy transaction  which we believe will create a stronger competitor in the institutional pharmacy industry and unlock substantial value for our shareholders on a tax free basis  and we continued to grow through acquisitions and organic development while also disposing of underperforming facilities to reposition our portfolio for future growth 
our hospital division  which has provided substantial growth over the years  faced significant regulatory challenges in during the second half of  medicare reimbursement rates were reduced  negatively impacting medicare revenues by approximately million  and medicare patient volumes declined on a same store basis during the same period 
after a difficult third quarter  our hospital division reported strong fourth quarter results driven primarily by strength in our non government business and operating efficiencies within certain administrative functions 
despite medicare reimbursement difficulties  our hospitals reported growth in revenues and admissions for the full year 
excluding the effect of significant favorable prior year medicare cost report settlements in  our hospital operating income increased in in and beyond  we will continue to explore ways to better utilize our existing hospital capacity by further developing our relationships with managed care providers and expanding our services 
in our health services division  fiscal was a year in which our continued investments in quality and customer service began to result in significant improvements in our operating results 
these investments over the past several years have included  among other things  improved staffing and clinical resource development  reduced contract labor utilization  investments in physical plant and equipment and expansion of services to effectively care for higher acuity medicare and managed care patients 
we also have continued to execute on our risk management initiatives  which have provided a more stable environment to improve our clinical processes and resolve quality issues when they arise 
in addition  these quality investments enabled our nursing centers to successfully transition to the expanded medicare rugs categories that became effective on january  our operating results in this division were encouraging  with solid growth in revenues  overall occupancy  medicare and managed care mix and operating income compared to we believe that there are additional opportunities to improve our nursing center results in the future by continuing to execute our strategy of providing cost effective care to higher acuity patients and residents 
in peoplefirst rehabilitation  we made progress in to position this business to grow beyond the kindred hospital and nursing center portfolio that currently comprises most of its revenues 
after operating for less than three years as a separate division  peoplefirst has one of the most effective therapist recruitment and retention programs in the industry and its name recognition and reputation for clinical excellence is expanding in the marketplace 
as the labor market for therapists becomes more competitive  peoplefirst is well positioned to grow through a program of external contract development and higher levels of productivity 
over the longer term  we believe that this division has opportunities to grow in a regulatory environment that is generally favorable to providing more rehabilitation therapy services in lower cost settings  particularly nursing centers 
the most significant regulatory changes in occurred in our kps institutional pharmacy business 
on january   the medicare part d program became effective 
as a result  a substantial portion of our revenues shifted from a state sponsored medicaid payor source to a federally funded program 
like most providers in the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements industry  the medicare part d transition for kps was challenging and required a number of operational changes as well as an extensive communications and implementation plan for each of our nursing center customers 
while was a transition year from a regulatory and operational perspective  significant efforts also were required to integrate acquisitions and prepare for the proposed pharmacy transaction 
fiscal also marked the conclusion of all remaining issues related to our reorganization 
the ventas rent reset issue was successfully concluded through an independent appraisal process 
this was a significant event for kindred  providing clarity around our capital costs and a financial framework that will accommodate our future growth and expansion plans 
in addition to the rent reset issue  all of our outstanding warrants issued in connection with our reorganization expired in april  resulting in the issuance of a significant number of shares of common stock 
we expended all of the million of warrant proceeds to repurchase shares and expended another million to complete our previously announced share repurchase program 
these transactions have simplified our equity structure and reduced our diluted share count by approximately compared to in october  we entered into a definitive agreement related to the proposed pharmacy transaction 
we believe that the business prospects underlying the proposed pharmacy transaction  including the operational synergies and economies of scale that can be realized over the long term  provide a compelling opportunity to enhance kindred shareholder value 
we expect to complete the proposed pharmacy transaction in the second quarter of with respect to future growth opportunities  we continued our program of organic development and selective acquisitions 
in  we acquired six hospitals licensed beds  nursing centers  licensed beds  four assisted living facilities licensed beds and three institutional pharmacies  customer beds 
in addition  we opened two hospitals containing licensed beds and opened five pharmacies in new markets 
in  we will continue to seek further organic development and strategic acquisitions that enhance shareholder value and that reflect a more concentrated market by market strategy 
we have already entered into an agreement to lease eight additional nursing centers  and we expect to open four hospitals in that are currently under development 
hospital division revenues increased in to billion and in to billion  primarily as a result of growth in admissions  new hospital development  the commonwealth transaction and  in  favorable reimbursement rates

there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december  in october  ventas exercised a one time right to reset rent under each of the master lease agreements 
these new aggregate annual rents of approximately million became effective retroactively to july  and were determined as fair market rentals by the final independent appraisers engaged in connection with the rent reset process under the master lease agreements 
aggregate annual ventas rents prior to the rent reset approximated million 
as required  ventas paid us a reset fee of approximately million that will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining original terms of the master lease agreements 
in connection with the exercise of the rent reset  the new annual rents were allocated among the facilities subject to the master lease agreements in accordance with the determinations made by the final appraisers during the rent reset process 
the new contingent annual rent escalator is for master lease agreements nos 
 and the new contingent annual rent escalator for master lease agreement no 
is based upon the cpi with a floor of and a ceiling of 
prior to the rent reset  the contingent annual ventas rent escalator under each of the master lease agreements was 
in  we had agreed to pay ventas additional rents in varying amounts generally over seven years in consideration for the divestiture of our former florida and texas nursing centers 
for accounting purposes  these additional rent payments were classified as long term debt 
as a result of the rent reset  the remaining obligations under the agreement were extinguished 
for accounting purposes  our remaining debt obligation to ventas of million as of july  has been reclassified as a deferred credit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and will be amortized as a reduction of rent expense over the remaining original terms of the master lease agreements 
the leases for nursing centers and eight hospitals expire in april under the master lease agreements 
these facilities are held in seven renewal bundles 
at our option  all  but not less than all  of the leased properties in each bundle may be extended for one five year renewal term beyond the initial term at the then existing rental rate plus the then existing escalator amount per annum 
the rental rate will escalate each year during the renewal term at the applicable escalation rate 
the renewal notices for these bundles of leased properties must be delivered to ventas on or before april  in august  we entered into definitive agreements related to the hcp transaction 
under the hcp transaction  we acquired the real estate related to unprofitable nursing centers operated by us for resale in exchange for three hospitals previously owned by us 
the hcp transaction was completed in january as part of the hcp transaction  we will continue to operate the hospitals under a long term lease arrangement with hcp 
in addition  we paid hcp a one time cash payment of approximately million 
we also amended our existing master lease with hcp to terminate the current annual rent of approximately million on the nursing centers  add the three hospitals to the master lease with a current annual rent of approximately million and extend the initial expiration date of the master lease until january  except for one hospital which has an expiration date of january  in november  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell the real estate and related operations of these nursing centers for million 
in february  we sold nine of the nursing centers for approximately million and we expect to close on the sale of the other two nursing centers for approximately million during in august  our board of directors authorized us to execute up to million in common stock and warrant repurchases 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market at an aggregate cost of approximately million  thereby completing the

we financed the repurchases from both operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our series a warrants and series b warrants expired on april  in connection with the exercise of these warrants  we issued approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of approximately million 
these proceeds were used to repurchase approximately million shares of our common stock in the open market in in december  we completed certain amendments to our revolving credit facility 
these amendments  among other things  allowed us to increase the credit capacity from million to million and increased the amount permitted for acquisitions and certain investments from million to million 
we obtained lender commitments for the increased credit capacity in february at december   our remaining permitted acquisition amount aggregated million 
in august  we completed certain amendments to our revolving credit facility 
these amendments a increased the amount permitted for acquisitions and certain investments by us from million to million  b provided us with the additional flexibility to repurchase up to million of our common stock and warrants  and c increased the permitted capital expenditures in each fiscal year 
these amendments also expanded the borrowing base of the revolving credit facility to include certain additional real estate holdings 
in addition  these amendments clarified certain regulatory issues and expanded certain representations and covenants by us  none of which are expected to impact our financial flexibility

index to financial statements as a result of improved professional liability underwriting results of our limited purpose insurance subsidiary  we received a return of capital of million in and million in from our limited purpose insurance subsidiary 
these proceeds were used primarily to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we funded approximately million into our limited purpose insurance subsidiary in to satisfy fiscal funding requirements 
capital resources excluding acquisitions  capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in excluding acquisitions  capital expenditures including new hospital development could approximate million to million in we believe that our capital expenditure program is adequate to improve and equip existing facilities 
capital expenditures in each of the last three years were financed through internally generated funds 
at december   the estimated cost to complete and equip construction in progress approximated million 
in february  we completed the commonwealth transaction for a total purchase price of million in cash and the assumption of certain operating lease obligations 
the acquisition was primarily financed with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we expended million and million during and  respectively  for pharmacy acquisitions 
we financed these acquisitions primarily through the use of operating cash flows 
acquisitions during related primarily to certain hospital acquisitions and our strategic divestiture activities in which we acquired previously leased facilities for resale 
at december   the remaining permitted acquisition amount under our revolving credit facility aggregated million 
other information effects of inflation and changing prices we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
congress and certain state legislatures have enacted or may enact additional significant cost containment measures limiting our ability to recover our cost increases through increased pricing of our healthcare services 
medicare revenues in ltac hospitals and nursing centers are subject to fixed payments under the medicare prospective payment systems 
medicaid reimbursement rates in many states in which we operate nursing centers also are based upon fixed payment systems 
generally  these rates are adjusted annually for inflation 
however  these adjustments may not reflect the actual increase in the costs of providing healthcare services 
on january   cms issued the proposed rule 
the proposed rule would be effective for discharges occurring on or after july  through june  the proposed rule is subject to a day public comment period 
cms projects an overall decrease in payments to all medicare certified ltac hospitals of from the proposed rule 
included in this proposed decrease are an increase to the standard federal payment rate of  revisions to payment methodologies impacting short stay outliers which reduce payments by  adjustments to the wage index component of the federal payment resulting in projected reductions in payment of  and an extension of the policy known as the percent rule to all ltac hospitals  which cms projects will reduce payments by 
we believe that the proposed rule  if adopted  could reduce medicare reimbursement to our hospitals by approximately million in the second half of the proposed short stay outlier revisions would create a new category for cases having lengths of stay less than a threshold which is based upon the average of a patient in a short term hospital with the same diagnosis 

table of contents 
index to financial statements payment for such cases would be based upon the payment that the short term acute care hospital would have received 
currently  cms has regulations governing payment to ltac hospitals that are co located with another hospital  such as a hih 
most co located hospitals can admit up to of its patients from its host hospital and be paid according to ltac pps 
admissions that exceed this percent rule are paid using the short term hospital payment system 
patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short term hospital are not counted when computing the limit 
cms is currently phasing in this policy which will become fully effective on september  cms is now proposing to expand this policy to all ltac hospitals  regardless of whether they are co located with another hospital 
under this proposal  all ltac hospitals will be paid ltac pps rates for admissions from a single referral source up to 
admissions beyond would be paid using the short term hospital payment system 
patients reaching high cost outlier status in the short term hospital are not counted when computing the limit 
under the proposal  the threshold would not apply immediately to certain ltac hospitals 
hospitals having fiscal years beginning on or after july  and before october   including most of our hospitals  will have their admission cap initially set at 
for most of our hospitals  this cap would apply until september   after which the cap would be reduced to 
cms is also proposing that the annual update to the drg classifications and relative weights would be made in a budget neutral manner  effective october  as such  the estimated aggregate industry ltac pps payments would be unaffected by the annual recalibration of drg payment weights 
on august   cms issued rules to reweight ltac hospital drgs  among other things  beginning october  cms estimated that the effect of this rule would decrease medicare reimbursements to ltac hospitals by an additional 
the revised drg reweighting reduced our hospital medicare revenues by approximately million in the fourth quarter of based upon our historical medicare patient volumes  we expect the revised drg reweighting will reduce medicare revenues to our hospitals by approximately million to million on an annual basis 
on may   cms issued the hospital medicare rule 
the hospital medicare rule became effective for discharges occurring after june  the hospital medicare rule reduced our hospital medicare revenues by approximately million in based upon our historical medicare patient volumes  we expect the hospital medicare rule will reduce medicare revenues to our hospitals associated with short stay outliers and high cost outliers by approximately million on an annual basis 
this estimate does not include the negative impact resulting from the elimination of the annual market basket adjustment to the medicare payment rates that also is contained in the hospital medicare rule 
the annual market basket adjustment has typically ranged between and  or approximately million to million annually 
the hospital medicare rule also extends until july  cms s authority to impose a one time prospective budget neutrality adjustment to ltac hospital rates 
this authority was previously scheduled to expire on october  most of our hospitals have been operating under ltac pps since september  operating results under this system are subject to changes in patient acuity and expense levels in our hospitals 
these factors  among others  are subject to significant change 
slight variations in patient acuity could significantly change medicare revenues generated under ltac pps 
in addition  our hospitals may not be able to appropriately adjust their operating costs as patient acuity levels change 
under this system  medicare reimbursements to our hospitals are based upon a fixed payment system 
operating margins in the hospital division could be negatively impacted if we are unable to control the operating costs of the division 
as a result of these uncertainties  we cannot predict the ultimate long term impact of ltac pps on our hospital operating results and we can provide no assurances that such regulations or operational changes resulting from these regulations will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition  we can provide 
table of contents 
index to financial statements no assurances that ltac pps will not have a material adverse effect on revenues from private and commercial third party payors 
various factors  including a reduction in average length of stay  have had a negative impact on revenues from private and commercial third party payors 
ltac pps maintains ltac hospitals as a distinct provider type  separate from short term acute care hospitals 
only providers certified as ltac hospitals may be paid under this system 
to maintain certification under ltac pps  the average length of stay of medicare patients must be at least days 
under the previous system  compliance with the day average length of stay threshold was based upon all patient discharges 
cms is currently evaluating various certification criteria for designating a hospital as a ltac hospital 
if such certification criteria were developed and enacted into legislation  our hospitals may not be able to maintain their status as ltac hospitals or may need to adjust their operations 
on august   cms published the final rules related to the drg weights and the geometric length of stay thresholds that took effect for hospital medicare discharges occurring on or after october  in connection with the final rules  cms estimated that these changes could result in an aggregate reduction in payments to ltac hospitals of approximately 
these changes reduced our hospital medicare revenues by approximately million in the fourth quarter of and million for medicare payments to our nursing centers are based upon certain rugs payment rates developed by cms that provide various levels of reimbursement based upon patient acuity 
on july   cms published the final rules related to revised rug payment rates to nursing centers 
among other things  the final rules provide for a inflation update to all rugs categories effective october  in addition  the final rules increase the indexing of rug categories  expand the total rug categories from to and eliminate the payment add on for the care of higher acuity patients that had been in effect since under the bbra 
on february   congress passed the deficit reduction act of this legislation allows  among other things  an annual  medicare part b outpatient therapy cap  effective january  the legislation also requires cms to implement a broad process for reviewing medically necessary therapy claims  creating an exception to the cap 
this exception process  which was set to expire on january   was included in the tax relief and health care act of and will continue to function as an exception to the medicare part b outpatient therapy cap until january  on january   medicare part d implemented a major expansion of the medicare program through the introduction of a prescription drug benefit 
medicare beneficiaries who also are entitled to benefits under a state medicaid program so called dual eligibles will have their outpatient prescription drug costs covered by the new medicare drug benefit  subject to certain limitations 
most of the nursing center residents that we serve whose drug costs are currently covered by state medicaid programs are dual eligibles who will qualify for the new medicare drug benefit 
accordingly  medicaid will no longer be a primary payor for the pharmacy services provided to these residents 
the first year of medicare part d resulted in significant challenges to our institutional pharmacy business as well as the institutional pharmacy industry 
these challenges included  but were not limited to  the inability of the medicare part d program to accurately reflect dual eligible residents  inaccurate reimbursement associated with medicare co payments and extensive prior authorization and other processes mandated by the pdps 
we cannot assure you that the challenges presented by medicare part d and the regulations promulgated under medicare part d will not have a material adverse effect on our institutional pharmacy business 
we believe that our operating margins may continue to be under pressure as the growth in operating expenses  particularly professional liability  labor and employee benefits costs  exceeds payment increases from third party payors 
in addition  as a result of competitive pressures  our ability to maintain operating margins through price increases to private patients is limited
