table of contents westwood management general westwood management provides investment advisory services to large institutions  including corporate pension funds  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  having at least million in investable assets  depending on the asset class 
westwood management also provides advisory services to the whg funds and subadvisory services to other mutual funds 
our overall investment philosophy is determined by our chief investment officer  susan m 
byrne  and  with respect to the bulk of assets under management  is a value oriented approach that is focused on achieving a superior  risk adjusted return by investing in companies that are positioned for growth but are not fully recognized as such in the marketplace 
this investment approach is designed to preserve capital in unfavorable periods and to provide superior real returns over the long term 
ms 
byrne has over years of investment experience 
westwood management s investment advisory team also possesses substantial investment management experience  including a number of investment management  research and trading professionals 
the continuity of the team and its years of experience are critical elements in successfully managing investments 
managed asset classes asset management 
we provide clients with a broad range of investment asset classes designed to meet varying investment objectives 
this affords our clients the opportunity to meet their investment objectives through the use of one investment adviser 
more than half of our assets under management are invested in our largecap value asset class 
the following sets forth the principal asset classes currently managed by westwood management largecap value investments in equity securities of approximately well seasoned companies with market capitalizations generally over billion 
our strategy for this portfolio is to invest in companies where we expect that future profitability  driven by operational improvements  will be higher than expectations reflected in current share prices 
smidcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between million and billion 
similar to the largecap value asset class  we seek to discover the same kinds of operational improvements that are driving earnings growth  but within small to mid size companies that can be purchased inexpensively 
smallcap value investments in equity securities of approximately companies with market capitalizations between million and billion 
similar to the largecap value and smidcap value classes  we seek to invest in high quality companies where earnings growth is driven by operational improvements that are not fully recognized by the market 
allcap value investments in equity securities of approximately well seasoned companies 
the portfolio is generally comprised of the best ideas within all market capitalizations above million 
similar to the largecap value asset class  we seek to invest in companies where we expect that future profitability  driven by operational improvements  will be higher than expectations reflected in current share prices across a broad range of market capitalizations 
real estate investment trusts or reits investments in the publicly traded equity securities of approximately real estate investment trusts 
our investment process involves making investment selections based on qualitative research of high quality reits 
balanced investments in a combination of equity and fixed income securities  which are designed to provide both growth opportunities and income  while also placing emphasis upon asset preservation in down markets 
westwood management applies its expertise in dynamic asset allocation and security selection in carrying out this balanced strategy approach 
income opportunity investments in dividend paying common stocks  straight and convertible preferred stock  master limited partnerships  reits and selected debt instruments 
the portfolio strategy focuses on companies with strong and improving cash flow sufficient to support a sustainable or rising income stream for investors 
this asset class is targeted towards investors seeking high current income through dividend paying and or interest bearing securities 

table of contents fixed income core intermediate bonds investments in high grade  intermediate term  corporate and government bonds 
we seek to add value to client portfolios through yield curve positioning and investment in improving credit quality 
each asset class is a portfolio of equity and or fixed income securities selected by westwood management s portfolio teams to best provide the long term returns consistent with westwood management s investment philosophy 
our portfolio teams make decisions for all of westwood management s asset classes in accordance with the investment objectives and policies of such asset classes  including determining when and which securities to purchase and sell 
we primarily employ a value oriented approach in managing the bulk of our equity asset classes 
the common thread that permeates throughout our investment strategies is our focus on a disciplined approach to controlling risk and preserving the core value of the assets under management whenever possible 
our value oriented asset classes have a greater emphasis on identifying companies where earnings result from actual operational improvements and not manufactured improvements occurring through financial statement adjustments 
our desire to prevent the loss of the core value of the assets under management is the overriding objective of this strategy  even if the cost is the loss of opportunity for potentially higher returns 
whether through investments in industry leaders or in companies that provide steady and stable growth  westwood management seeks to consistently demonstrate superior performance relative to industry peers and the broad market 
more than two thirds of our assets under management are invested in equity securities of companies with a large market capitalization 
when measured over multi year periods  ten years and longer  westwood management s principal asset classes rank above the median within their peer groups in performance according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc for the ten year period ended on december   our largecap value and balanced asset classes rank in the top quartile in their peer groups 
our ability to grow our assets under management is dependent on our competitive long term performance record and our strong relationships with investment consulting firms throughout the nation 
we are continually looking for opportunities to expand our asset classes in terms of growing our existing asset classes and developing new portfolios focusing on investment areas that are not currently part of our asset classes under management 
we primarily intend to grow our asset classes internally  but may also consider acquiring new asset classes from third parties  as discussed under growth strategy below 
our growth strategy not only provides our clients more investment opportunities  but also diversifies our assets under management  thereby reducing our risk in any one area of investment and increasing our competitive ability to attract new clients 
cash management 
westwood management also provides cash management and custodial services for the cash reserve funds of sws 
the sws cash reserve funds totaled million at december  advisory and subadvisory service agreements westwood management manages accounts of its clients under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
as is common in the asset management industry  these agreements are usually terminable upon short notice and provide for compensation based on the market value of the client s assets under management 
westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on the assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter  quarterly in arrears based on the assets under management on the last day of the quarter just ended  or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period 
revenue from advance payments is deferred and recognized over the period that services are performed 
pursuant to these agreements  westwood management provides overall investment management services  including directing investments in conformity with the investment objectives and restrictions imposed by the clients 
unless otherwise directed in writing by our client  westwood management has the authority to vote all proxies with respect to a client s assets 
westwood management is also a party to subadvisory agreements with other investment advisors under which it performs substantially the same services as it does under its advisory agreements 
however  the investment strategy adopted for a particular client is subject to supervision and review by the client 
our subadvisory fees are computed based upon the daily net assets of the client and are payable on a monthly basis 
as with our advisory agreements  these agreements are terminable upon short notice 

table of contents under our subadvisory agreement with gabelli advisers  inc  westwood management provides investment advisory services to the westwood funds family of mutual funds 
the westwood equity fund is a large cap value fund with assets consisting of securities valued at approximately million as of december  for the ten year period ended on december   the westwood equity fund ranked in the th percentile in the large value category according to morningstar  inc westwood management owns shares of class a common stock representing a economic interest in gabelli advisers  inc  a subsidiary of gamco investors  inc based on sec filings  we believe that gamco investors  inc owned of our common stock as of december  westwood management received subadvisory payments of   and  for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
while westwood management provides subadvisory services with respect to the westwood funds family of funds  westwood management provides investment advisory services directly to the whg funds family of mutual funds  namely the whg smidcap fund  the whg income opportunity fund  the whg largecap value fund and the whg balanced fund 
our four largest clients accounted for approximately of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  westwood trust general westwood trust provides trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors to institutions and high net worth individuals generally having at least million in assets under management 
westwood trust seeks to define and improve the risk return profile of the client s investment portfolio by complementing or enhancing existing investment strategies 
westwood trust also provides back office services to its clients  including tax reporting  distribution of income to beneficiaries  preparation of trust and account statements and attending to the special needs of particular trusts  as well as serves as trustee for tax and estate planning purposes  and for special needs trusts 
westwood trust is chartered and regulated by the texas department of banking 
westwood trust primarily provides services for employee benefit trusts and personal trusts 
employee benefit trusts include retirement plans of businesses to benefit their employees  such as defined contribution plans  pensions and profit sharing plans 
westwood trust may also be appointed trustee and provide administrative support for these plans  as well as investment advisory and custodial services 
personal trusts are developed to achieve a number of different objectives  and westwood trust acts as trustee to these trusts and assists in developing tax efficient trust portfolios for them 
the fees charged by westwood trust are separately negotiated with each client and are based on the complexity of the operations of the trust and the amount of assets under management 
services westwood trust undertakes a fiduciary responsibility toward the management of each client s assets and utilizes a consultative asset allocation approach 
this approach involves westwood trust examining the client s financial situation  including the client s portfolio of investments  and advising the client on ways in which it can enhance its investment returns and financial position 
westwood trust also provides custodial services  safekeeping and accounting services 
common trust funds westwood trust sponsors a number of common trust funds in which clients assets are commingled to achieve economies of scale 
westwood trust s common trust funds fall within two basic categories personal trust and employee benefit trust 
westwood trust sponsors common trust funds for most of the asset classes managed by westwood management 
westwood trust also engages third party subadvisors for some of its common trust funds  such as our growth equity  international equity and high yield bond common trust funds 

table of contents enhanced balanced portfolios westwood trust is a strong proponent of asset class diversification  and offers its clients the ability to diversify among eleven different asset classes 
westwood trust enhanced balanced portfolios seek to combine these asset classes into a unique customizable portfolio for clients seeking to maximize return for a given level of risk 
periodic adjustments are made to asset class weightings in enhanced balanced portfolios based on historical return  risk and correlation data  as well as an analysis of its capital markets outlook 
distribution channels we market our services through several distribution channels that allow us to expand the reach of our investment advisory services 
these channels provide us the ability to leverage the existing distribution infrastructure and capabilities of other financial services firms and intermediaries and focus on our core competency of developing outstanding investment asset classes 
institutional investment consultants investment management consulting firms serve as gatekeepers to a large percentage of corporate pension plans  endowments and foundations  which represent westwood s primary client markets 
consultants provide guidance and expertise in setting a client s asset allocation strategy  as well as the establishment of an investment policy 
in addition  consultants make recommendations of investment firms that they believe will best meet their client s investment objectives 
we have established strong relationships with many national and regional investment consulting firms  which has resulted in us being considered and hired by many of their clients 
continuing to enhance our existing consulting firm relationships  as well as forging new relationships  serves to increase the awareness of our services in both the consultant community and the underlying institutional client base 
subadvisory relationships our subadvisory relationships allow us to extend the reach of our investment management services to the clients of other investment companies that have broad  established distribution capabilities 
in subadvisory arrangements  our client is typically the investment company through which our services are offered to investors 
in these subadvisory arrangements  our investment advisory services are typically made available through retail based mutual fund offerings 
the investment company that sponsors the mutual fund is responsible for marketing  distribution  operations and accounting related to these funds 
managed accounts managed accounts are similar in some respects to subadvisory relationships  in that a third party financial institution  such as a brokerage firm or turnkey asset management program provider  handles distribution to the end client 
the end client in a managed account is typically a high net worth individual or small institution 
in these arrangements  the third party financial institution is responsible to the end client for client service  operations and accounting 
growth strategy we believe that we have established a strong platform to support future growth  deriving our strength in large part from the experience and capabilities of our management team and skilled investment professionals 
we believe that assembling this focused  stable team has contributed in large part to our solid investment performance  superior client service and a growing array of available asset classes 
we believe our opportunities for future growth may come from our ability to generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships  attract and retain key employees  grow assets in our additional asset classes  foster continued growth of the westwood trust platform  foster expanded distribution via mutual funds  pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances  and 
table of contents continue to strengthen our brand name 
generate growth from new and existing clients and consultant relationships 
as our primary business objective  we intend to maintain and enhance existing relationships with clients and investment consultants by continuing to provide solid investment performance and a high level of quality service to these existing relationships 
additionally  we intend to pursue growth through targeted sales and marketing efforts that emphasize our investment performance and superior client service 
new institutional client accounts are generally derived through investment consultants  and we have been successful in developing solid long term relationships with many national and regional investment consultants 
the familiarity with our firm  our people and our processes that we have built in these relationships is one of the key factors in being considered for new client investment mandates 
attract and retain key employees 
in order to achieve our performance and client relationship objectives  we must be able to retain and attract talented investment professionals 
we believe that we have created a workplace environment in which motivated  performance driven  and client oriented individuals thrive 
as a public company  we are able to offer to our employees a compensation program that includes strong equity incentives so that the success of our employees will be closely tied to the success of our clients 
we believe these factors are critical ingredients in maintaining a stable  client focused environment 
as a result  we have built a firm that we believe can support significant future growth 
grow assets in our additional asset classes 
while largecap value is our flagship product  we continue to develop additional asset classes in response to client needs and opportunities we see in the marketplace 
westwood management has managed our smidcap value asset class with solid results for clients at westwood trust for several years 
we began marketing smidcap value to institutions in late and as of december   we had approximately million under management in that asset class 
we have also developed additional new asset classes in recent years that we intend to introduce to the institutional marketplace at the appropriate time in the future 
smallcap value now has a three year track record  income opportunity now has a four year track record and allcap value will soon have a five year track record 
we believe that we have the team in place to fully support these new products in the institutional marketplace 
we plan to begin marketing our smallcap value asset class to existing clients and institutional investment consultants during if we continue to deliver strong performance  we believe the demand for these asset classes can provide meaningful growth in our assets under management in the future 
foster continued growth of the westwood trust platform 
westwood trust has experienced solid growth in serving small to medium sized institutions and high net worth individuals 
we are seeing a growing level of interest from our clients in the diversified  highly attentive service model that we have developed 
we believe the continued acceptance of our enhanced balanced product  which offers diversified exposure to multiple asset classes in a tax efficient  comprehensive solution for clients  provides us with opportunities for future growth 
foster expanded distribution via mutual funds 
in december  we launched two new mutual funds  the whg smidcap fund and the whg income opportunity fund  and in  we launched two additional mutual funds  the whg largecap value fund and the whg balanced fund 
the whg funds  which mirror our institutional strategies  offer capped expense ratios in an institutional share class 
we believe that access to our smidcap value  income opportunity  largecap value and balanced asset classes via an institutional mutual fund vehicle will present an attractive offering for certain segments of institutional investors  including k plans 
pursue strategic acquisitions and alliances 
we will evaluate strategic acquisition  joint venture and alliance opportunities carefully 
we may  in time  have an interest in pursuing asset management firms or trust companies that have assets with respect to which we have expertise or those that appear appropriate as a means of expanding the range of asset classes or services we offer or expanding our distribution capabilities 
by acquiring investment firms that successfully manage asset classes in which we do not specialize  we could attract new clients and provide our existing clients with a more diversified range of asset classes 
we may also consider entering into alliances with other financial services firms that would allow us to leverage our core competency of developing superior investment products in combination with alliance partners that could provide us with enhanced distribution capabilities or provide our clients with access to additional service offerings 

table of contents continue strengthening our brand name 
we believe that the strength of our brand name has been a key component to our long term tenure in the investment industry and will continue to be instrumental to our future success 
we have developed our strong brand name largely through high profile coverage in various investment publications and electronic media 
a number of our investment professionals  including ms 
byrne and david s 
spika  investment strategist  enjoy a visible presence in print and electronic media  which we believe also enhances our brand name 
we will continue to look for creative ways to strengthen our brand name and reputation in our target client markets 
competition we are subject to substantial and growing competition in all aspects of our business 
barriers to entry to the asset management business are relatively low  and we believe that we will face a growing number of competitors 
although no one company dominates the asset management industry  many companies are larger  better known and have greater resources than we do 
further  we compete with other asset management firms on the basis of asset classes offered  the investment performance of those asset classes in absolute terms and relative to peer group performance  quality of service  fees charged  the level and type of compensation offered to key employees  and the manner in which asset classes are marketed 
many of our competitors have more asset classes and services and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
we compete against an ever increasing number of investment dealers  banks  insurance companies and others that sell equity funds  taxable income funds  tax free investments and other investment products 
in addition  the allocation by many investors of assets away from active equity investment to index funds  fixed income or similar asset classes has enhanced the ability of firms offering non equity asset classes and passive equity management to effectively compete with us 
in short  the competitive landscape in which we operate is both intense and dynamic  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the future as an independent company 
additionally  most prospective clients perform a thorough review of an investment manager s background  investment policies and performance before committing assets to that manager 
in many cases  prospective clients invite a number of competing firms to make presentations 
the process of obtaining a new client typically takes twelve to eighteen months from the time of the initial contact 
while we have achieved a degree of success in competing successfully for new clients  it is a process to which we must dedicate significant resources over an extended period  with no certainty of success 
regulation westwood management virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations are primarily intended to protect investment advisory clients and stockholders of registered investment advisers 
under such laws and regulations  agencies that regulate investment advisers  such as ourselves  have broad administrative powers  including the power to limit  restrict or prohibit such an adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations 
in such event  the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees  limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time  revocation of investment adviser and other registrations  censures and fines 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material laws and regulations

the sec is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the investment advisers act and the investment company act  ranging from censure to termination of an investment adviser s registration 
the failure of westwood management to comply with the requirements of the sec could have a material adverse effect on westwood 
we must also comply with anti money laundering laws and regulations  including the usa patriot act of we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the regulations under the investment advisers act  the investment company act and the usa patriot act 
westwood trust westwood trust also operates in a highly regulated environment and is subject to extensive supervision and examination 
as a texas chartered trust company  westwood trust is subject to the texas finance code the finance code  the rules and regulations promulgated under the finance code and supervision by the texas department of banking 
these laws are intended primarily for the protection of westwood trust s clients and creditors  rather than for the benefit of investors 
the finance code provides for and regulates a variety of matters  such as minimum capital maintenance requirements  restrictions on dividends  restrictions on investments of restricted capital  lending and borrowing limitations  prohibitions against engaging in certain activities  periodic examinations by the office of the texas department of banking commissioner  furnishing periodic financial statements to the texas department of banking commissioner  fiduciary record keeping requirements  and prior regulatory approval for certain corporate events such as mergers  sale purchase of all or substantially all of the assets and transactions transferring control of a trust company 
the finance code also gives the banking commissioner broad regulatory powers including penalties and civil and administrative actions if the trust company violates certain provisions of the finance code or conservatorship or closure if westwood trust is determined to be in a hazardous condition as the law defines that term 
westwood trust is limited by the finance code in the payment of dividends to undivided profits which is described as that part of equity capital equal to the balance of net profits  income  gains  and losses since its formation date minus subsequent distributions to stockholders and transfers to surplus or capital under share dividends or appropriate board resolutions

risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
we believe these are all the material risks currently facing our business 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by these risks 
the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  including our financial statements and related notes 
poor investment performance of the assets managed by us could adversely affect our results of operations 
because we compete with many other asset management firms on the basis of asset classes offered and the investment performance of those asset classes  our success is dependent to a significant extent on the investment performance of the assets that we manage 
because our revenue is primarily generated from fees derived as a percentage of assets under management  poor performance tends to result in the loss or reduction of client accounts  which correspondingly decreases revenues 
underperformance relative to peer groups for our various asset classes could adversely affect our results of operations  especially if such underperformance is sustained for a lengthy period of time 
some members of our management are critical to our success  and our inability to attract and retain key employees could compromise our future success 
we believe that our future success will depend to a significant extent upon the services of our executive officers  particularly susan m 
byrne  our chairman of the board and chief investment officer  and brian o 
casey  our president and chief executive officer 
as with other asset management businesses  our future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of these and certain other officers  investment professionals and other key marketing  client service and management personnel 
there is substantial competition for these types of skilled personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could negatively impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
our revenues are dependent upon the performance of the securities markets and negative performance of the securities markets could reduce our revenues 
our results of operations are affected by many economic factors  including the performance of the securities markets 
negative performance in the securities markets or certain segments of those markets  or short term volatility in the securities markets or segments thereof  could result in investors withdrawing assets from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could reduce our revenues 
because most of our revenues are based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of those assets would also adversely affect our revenues 
in addition  in periods of slowing growth or declining revenues  profits and profit margins are adversely affected because certain expenses remain relatively fixed 
in particular  more than half of our assets under management are invested in equity securities of companies with a large market capitalization 
as a consequence  we are particularly susceptible to the volatility associated with changes in the market for large capitalization stocks 
due to this concentration  any change or reduction in such markets  including a shift of our clients and potential clients preference from investments in equity securities of large capitalization stocks to other equity or fixed income securities could have a significant negative impact on our revenues and results of operations 
this negative impact could occur due to the depreciation in value of our assets under management and or the election by clients to select other firms to manage their assets  either of which events would result in decreased assets under management and therefore reduced revenues and a decline in results of operations 
if we are unable to realize benefits from the costs we have incurred and are continuing to incur to develop new asset classes and otherwise broaden our capabilities  our growth opportunities may be adversely affected 

table of contents we have incurred significant costs over the last several years to develop new asset classes  including smidcap value  smallcap value  allcap value and income opportunity  to launch four new mutual funds  the whg smidcap fund  the whg income opportunity fund  the whg largecap value fund and the whg balanced fund and also to upgrade our business infrastructure 
some of the costs associated with these improvements will continue to be incurred in future periods and are relatively fixed 
we may not realize the benefits of these investments and  in the event we are not able to do so  our growth opportunities may be adversely affected 
due to the substantial cost and time required to introduce new asset classes in our industry  we may not be able to successfully introduce new asset classes in a timely manner  or at all 
the development and marketing of new asset classes in our industry requires a substantial amount of time and financial resources 
our ability to successfully market and sell a new asset class depends on our financial resources  the performance results of the asset class  the timing of the offering and our marketing strategies 
once an asset class is developed  whether through acquisition or internal development  we must still effectively market the asset class to our existing and prospective clients 
this entails incurring significant financial expenses related to research on the target assets and the demand for such asset class in the market  as well as sales and marketing costs associated with attracting assets to the new asset class 
in addition  our ability to sell new asset classes to our existing and prospective clients depends on our ability to meet or exceed the performance of our competitors who offer the same or similar asset classes 
we may not be able to profitably manage the assets within a given asset class 
moreover  it may take years before we are able to produce the level of results that will enable us to attract clients 
if we are unable to realize the benefits of the costs and expenses incurred in developing new asset classes  we may experience losses as a result of our management of these asset classes  and our ability to introduce further new asset classes and compete in our industry may be hampered 
our business is dependent on investment advisory  subadvisory and trust agreements that are subject to termination or non renewal 
as a result  we could lose any of our clients on very short notice 
substantially all of our revenues are derived pursuant to investment advisory  subadvisory and trust agreements with our clients 
in general  either party may terminate these agreements upon days notice 
any termination of or failure to renew a material number of these agreements could have a material adverse impact on us  particularly because many of our costs are relatively fixed 
a small number of clients account for a substantial portion of our business 
as such  the reduction or loss of business with any of these clients could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our largest four clients accounted for of total revenues for the twelve months ended december   and we are therefore dependent to a significant degree on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with these clients 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in maintaining these existing client relationships or in securing additional clients 
any failure by us to retain one or more of these large clients or establish profitable relationships with additional clients could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competitive fee pressures could reduce revenues and profit margins 
the investment management business is highly competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry 
to the extent we are forced to compete on the basis of price  we may not be able to maintain our current fee structure 
although our investment management fees vary from product to product  historically we have competed primarily on the performance of our products and our client service and not on the level of our investment management fees relative to those of our competitors 
in recent years  however  there has been a trend toward lower fees in the investment management industry 
in order to maintain our fee structure in a competitive environment  we must be able to continue to provide clients with investment returns and service that make investors willing to pay our fees 
we cannot be assured that we will succeed in providing investment returns and service that will allow us to maintain our current fee structure 
fee reductions on existing or future new business could have an adverse effect on our profit margins and results of operations 

table of contents any event that negatively affects the asset management industry in general could have a material adverse effect on us 
any event affecting the asset management industry that results in a general decrease in assets under management or a significant general decline in the number of advisory clients or accounts could negatively impact our revenues 
our future growth and success depends in part upon the growth of the asset management industry 
our business is subject to extensive regulation with attendant costs of compliance and serious consequences for violations 
virtually all aspects of our business are subject to various laws and regulations including  the investment advisers act  the investment company act and anti money laundering laws 
these laws and regulations generally grant regulatory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers  including  in some cases  the power to limit or restrict us from operating our business and  in other cases  the powers to place us under conservatorship or closure  in the event we fail to comply with such laws and regulations 
violations of such laws or regulations could subject us and or our employees to disciplinary proceedings or civil or criminal liability  including revocation of licenses  censures  fines or temporary suspension  permanent bar from the conduct of business  conservatorship or closure 
any such proceeding or liability could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
due to the extensive regulations and laws to which we are subject  our management is required to devote substantial time and effort to legal and regulatory compliance issues 
in addition  the regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to change 
we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations or by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations 
see regulation 
misuse of assets and information in the possession of our investment professionals and employees could result in costly litigation and liability for us and our clients 
our investment professionals handle a significant amount of assets  financial and personal information for our clients 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of assets and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate to prevent taking or misuse by our portfolio managers or employees 
if our controls are ineffective in preventing the fraudulent taking or misuse of assets and information  we could be subject to costly litigation  which could consume a substantial amount of our resources and distract our management from our operations and could also result in regulatory sanctions 
additionally  any such fraudulent actions could adversely affect some of our clients in other ways  and these clients could seek redress against us 
acquisitions involve inherent risks that could compromise the success of the combined business and dilute the holdings of current stockholders 
as part of our long term business strategy  we may consider acquisitions of similar or complementary businesses 
see growth strategy 
if we are not correct when we assess the value  strengths  weaknesses  liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates or if we are not successful in integrating the operations of the acquired businesses  the success of the combined business could be compromised 
any future acquisitions will be accompanied by the risks commonly associated with acquisitions 
these risks include  among others  potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and to acquisition costs and expenses  the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption to the business of the combined company and potential diversion of management s time and attention  the impairment of relationships with and the possible loss of key employees and clients as a result of the changes in management  potential future write downs related to goodwill impairment in connection with acquisitions  and dilution to the stockholders of the combined company if the acquisition is made for stock of the combined company 
in addition  asset classes  technologies or businesses of acquired companies may not be effectively assimilated into our business or have a positive effect on the combined company s revenues or earnings 
the combined company may also incur significant expense to complete acquisitions and to support the acquired asset classes and businesses 
further  any such acquisitions may be funded with cash  debt or equity  which could have the effect of diluting the holdings or limiting the rights of stockholders 
finally  we may not be successful in identifying attractive acquisition candidates or completing acquisitions on favorable terms 

table of contents we are a holding company and are dependent on the operations and funds of our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company  with no revenue generating operations and no assets other than our ownership interests in westwood management and westwood trust 
accordingly  we are dependent on the cash flow generated by these operating subsidiaries and must rely on dividends or other intercompany transfers from these operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations 
various factors may hinder the declaration and payment of dividends 
we have historically paid a quarterly dividend 
however  the payment of dividends in the future is subject to the discretion of our board of directors  and various factors may prevent us from paying dividends 
such factors include our financial position  capital requirements and liquidity  the existence of a stock repurchase program  any loan agreement restrictions  state corporate and banking law restrictions  results of operations and such other factors as our board of directors may consider relevant 
in addition  as a holding company  our ability to pay dividends is dependent on the dividends and income we receive from our subsidiaries 
at the present time our primary source of cash is dividends that may be received from westwood management or westwood trust 
the payment of dividends by westwood management or westwood trust is subject to the discretion of their boards of directors and compliance with applicable laws  including  in particular  the provisions of the texas finance code applicable to westwood trust 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our business is vulnerable to systems failures that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any delays or inaccuracies in securities pricing information or information processing could give rise to claims against us  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are highly dependent on communications and information systems and on third party vendors for securities pricing information and updates from certain software 
we may suffer a systems failure or interruption  whether caused by an earthquake  fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  unauthorized access  act of god  act of war or otherwise  and our back up procedures and capabilities may not be adequate or sufficient to eliminate the risk of extended interruptions in operations 
we may not be able to fund future capital requirements on favorable terms if at all 
we cannot be certain that financing to fund our working capital or other cash requirements  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our capital requirements will vary greatly from quarter to quarter depending on  among other things  capital expenditures  fluctuations in our operating results and financing activities 
if future financing is necessary  we may or may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all 
further  any future equity financings could dilute the relative percentage ownership of the then existing holders of our common stock  and any future debt financings could involve restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions 
failure to maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our brand and operating results could be harmed 
all internal control systems  no matter how well designed  have inherent limitations 
therefore  even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation 
while we continue to evaluate and improve our internal controls  we cannot be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in 
table of contents accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
in addition  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
our organizational documents contain provisions that may prevent or deter another group from paying a premium over the market price to our stockholders to acquire our stock 
our organizational documents contain provisions that require a vote of two thirds of the shares of stock entitled to vote to remove directors for cause  establish that stockholders cannot act by written consent  and that authorize our board of directors to issue  without shareholder approval  blank check preferred stock 
in addition  as a delaware corporation  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law relating to business combinations 
these provisions could delay  deter or prevent a merger  consolidation  tender offer or other business combination or change of control involving us that could include a premium over the market price of our common stock that some or a majority of our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests

overview we manage investment assets and provide services for our clients through our two subsidiaries  westwood management and westwood trust 
westwood management provides investment advisory services to corporate pension funds  public retirement plans  endowments and foundations  the whg funds  other mutual funds and clients of westwood trust 
westwood trust provides to institutions and high net worth individuals trust and custodial services and participation in common trust funds that it sponsors 
our revenues are generally derived from fees based on a percentage of assets under management  and at december   westwood management and westwood trust collectively managed assets valued at approximately billion 
we have been providing investment advisory services since and  according to recognized industry sources  including morningstar  inc  when measured over multi year periods  our principal asset classes have consistently ranked above the median in performance within their peer groups 
one of the priorities on which we have focused since our spin off in is building a foundation in terms of personnel and infrastructure to support a potentially much larger business 
we have also developed products that we believe will be desirable within our target institutional and private client markets 
the cost of developing new products and the organization as a whole has resulted in us incurring expenses that  in some cases  do not currently have material offsetting revenue 
now that we believe the foundation and the products are in place  we are taking these new products 
table of contents to the institutional marketplace and believe that institutional investors will recognize the value in these products and generate new revenue streams for us 
we began marketing our smidcap value product to institutional investment consultants in late as a result of this targeted marketing effort  we gained a number of meaningful smidcap value clients in and we continue to devote significant marketing effort to our smidcap value product and intend to begin marketing our smallcap value product  which now has a three year track record  to the institutional market during we also launched four mutual funds under the whg funds name from december to september as of december   assets in these four funds were approximately million 
we have two additional whg funds that are registered with the sec  the whg smallcap value fund and the whg allcap value fund  and are evaluating opportunities to launch these funds in revenues we derive our revenues from investment advisory fees  trust fees  and other revenues 
our advisory fees are generated by westwood management  which manages its clients accounts under investment advisory and subadvisory agreements 
advisory fees are calculated based on a percentage of assets under management  and are paid in accordance with the terms of the agreements 
westwood management s advisory fees are paid quarterly in advance based on the assets under management on the last day of the preceding quarter  quarterly in arrears based on the assets under management on the last day of the quarter just ended  or are based on a daily or monthly analysis of assets under management for the stated period 
westwood management recognizes revenues as services are rendered 
since most of our advance paying clients billing periods coincide with the calendar quarter to which payment relates  the revenue related to those clients is fully recognized within the quarter 
consequently  there is not a significant amount of deferred revenue contained in our financial statements 
our trust fees are generated by westwood trust pursuant to trust or custodial agreements 
trust fees are separately negotiated with each client and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management  which in turn is influenced by the complexity of the operations of the trust and the services provided 
westwood trust also provides trust services to a small number of clients on a fixed fee basis 
most trust fees are paid quarterly in advance and are recognized as services are rendered 
since the majority of westwood trusts advance paying clients billing periods coincide with the calendar quarter to which payment relates  the revenue related to those clients is fully recognized within the quarter 
consequently  there is not a significant amount of deferred revenue contained in our financial statements 
our other revenues generally consist of interest and investment income 
although we invest most of our cash in money market funds  we also invest in bonds and equity instruments 
assets under management assets under management increased million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase in assets under management was primarily due to the market appreciation of assets under management and inflows of assets from new clients  partially offset by the withdrawal of assets by certain clients 
quarterly average assets under management increased billion  or  to billion for compared with billion for assets under management increased million  or  to billion at december  compared to billion at december  the increase in assets under management was primarily due inflows of assets from new clients and the market appreciation of assets under management  partially offset by the withdrawal of assets by certain clients

managed accounts represent relationships with brokerage firms and other registered investment advisors who offer westwood management s products to their customers 
westwood trust 
in the preceding table  commingled funds represent funds that have been established to facilitate investment of fiduciary funds of multiple clients by combining assets into a single trust for taxable and tax exempt entities 
private accounts represent discretionary accounts where westwood trust acts as trustee or agent and has full investment discretion 
agency custody accounts represent non discretionary accounts in which westwood trust provides agent or custodial services  but does not act in an advisory capacity 
for certain assets in this category  westwood trust provides limited custody services for a minimal or zero fee currently  but views these assets as potentially converting to fee generating managed assets in the future 
as an example  some assets in this category consist of low basis stock that is being held in custody for clients currently  but will likely transfer to fee generating managed assets during an intergenerational transfer of wealth at some point in the future

supplemental financial information as supplemental information  we are providing non gaap performance measures that we refer to as cash earnings and cash expenses 
we provide these measures in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income and total expenses  which are reported on a gaap basis 
both our management and board of directors review cash earnings and cash expenses to evaluate our ongoing performance  allocate resources and review dividend policy 
we believe that these non gaap performance measures  while not substitutes for gaap net income and total expenses  are useful for both management and investors to evaluate our underlying operating and financial performance and our available resources 
we do not advocate that investors consider these non gaap measures without considering financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
in calculating cash earnings  we add to net income the non cash expense associated with equity based compensation awards of restricted stock and stock options 
in calculating cash earnings for the year ended december   we also eliminate the non cash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle associated with our implementation of sfas no 
r 
we define cash expenses as total expenses less non cash equity based compensation expense 
although depreciation on fixed assets is a non cash expense  we do not add it back when calculating cash earnings or deduct it when calculating cash expenses because depreciation charges represent a decline in the value of the related assets that will ultimately require replacement 
for the year ended december   our cash earnings increased by to million compared with million for the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in total revenues

the changes in net cash provided by operating 
table of contents activities generally reflect the changes in earnings plus the effect of non cash items and changes in working capital 
changes in working capital  especially accounts receivable and accounts payable  are generally the result of timing differences between collection of fees billed and payment of operating expenses 
during  cash flow provided by operating activities  principally our investment advisory business  was million compared to million and million during and  respectively 
the increase of  from to was primarily due to increased cash earnings  offset in part by the net change in operating assets and liabilities

we had no liabilities for borrowed money at december  or december   and our accounts payable were paid in the ordinary course of business for each of the periods then ended 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors including our results of operations  the timing and magnitude of capital expenditures or strategic initiatives and our dividend policy 
we believe that current cash and short term investment balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the operating and capital requirements of our ordinary business operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not require additional financing within this time frame 
the failure to raise needed capital on attractive terms  if at all  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have evaluated our tax positions in the tax returns we have filed  as well as unfiled tax positions and the amounts 
table of contents comprising our deferred tax assets and determined that fin will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
the provisions of fas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of fas in september  the securities and exchange commission staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab established an approach that requires dual quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on the income statement  balance sheet and other disclosures 
it is referred to as the dual approach as it combines two widely used approaches  which focused on either the income statement or the balance sheet 
sab removes the singular focus on either of those financial statements and the lingering errors that could potentially result 
sab allows registrants to initially apply the dual approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and was adopted by us on december  the adoption of sab had no effect on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent losses and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in applying accounting principles  we must often make individual estimates and assumptions regarding expected outcomes or uncertainties 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are areas where the degree of judgment and complexity in determining amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
goodwill during the third quarters of  and  we completed our annual impairment assessment as required by sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment losses were required 
we perform our annual impairment assessment as of july stock options for all options granted after january   we have been expensing the cost associated with employees as well as non employee directors 
we value stock options issued based upon the black scholes option pricing model and recognize this value as an expense over the periods in which the options vest 
implementation of the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make certain assumptions  including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield and expected life of the options 
we utilized assumptions that we believed to be most appropriate at the time of the valuation 
had we used different assumptions in the pricing model the expense recognized for stock options may have been different than the expense recognized in our financial statements 
as of december   all outstanding options have vested and all related compensation has been expensed 

table of contents restricted stock we have granted restricted stock to employees and non employee directors 
in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  we calculate compensation cost for restricted stock grants by using the fair market value of its common stock at the date of grant  the number of shares issued and an estimate of shares that will not vest due to forfeitures 
this compensation cost is amortized on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting period 
the estimate of shares that will not vest due to forfeitures is based on our historical forfeiture rate and our expectation of potential forfeitures  which is dependent upon our judgment 
if actual experience differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially affected 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are summarized below 
revenue recognition investment advisory and trust fees are recognized in the period the services are provided 
these fees are determined in accordance with contracts between our subsidiaries and their clients and are generally based on a percentage of assets under management 
accounting for investments we have designated our investments other than money market holdings as trading securities  which are recorded at market value with the related unrealized gains and losses reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
our trading securities  primarily us government and government agency obligations as well as mutual fund and common trust fund shares  are valued based upon quoted market prices and  with respect to funds  the net asset value of the shares held as reported by the fund 
we have generally designated our investments in money market accounts as available for sale 
the market values of our money market holdings generally do not fluctuate 
dividends and interest on all of our investments are accrued as earned 
it em a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
we utilize various financial instruments such as equity mutual funds and us government and agency obligations  which entail certain inherent market risks 
we do not currently participate in any hedging activities  nor do we currently utilize any derivative financial instruments 
the following information describes the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risks 
interest rates and securities markets our cash equivalents and other investment instruments are exposed to financial market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates  which may affect our interest income 
these instruments are not entered into for trading purposes 
we do not expect our interest income to be significantly affected by a sudden change in market interest rates 
the value of our assets under management is affected by changes in interest rates and fluctuations in securities markets 
since we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from investment advisory and trust fees based on the value of assets under management  our revenues may be adversely affected by changing interest rates or a decline in the prices of securities generally
