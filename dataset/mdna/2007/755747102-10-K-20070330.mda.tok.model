item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
historical results and percentage relationships among accounts are not necessarily an indication of trends in operating results for any future period 
in these discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 

table of contents executive overview our revenue is directly related to the level of construction activity in our markets 
ordinarily  the construction segments that affect our business the most are the single family residential segment  the commercial construction segment and  to a lesser degree  the public works infrastructure segment  both highway and non highway 
accordingly  the significant reduction in residential construction during would likely have caused a corresponding drop in demand for our product 
fortunately  the construction activity in the non residential sectors remained sufficiently strong to mitigate the affect of the residential slowdown 
a prolonged decline in residential activity coinciding with a decline in one or more of the other sectors of the construction market could result in a significant reduction in demand for our product 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated in thousands years ended december  revenue related party revenue total revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income from operations interest income interest expense income tax expense net income depreciation and amortization year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue improved to million for the year ended december   which we refer to as  from million for the year ended december   which we refer to as the increase in revenue resulted from a increase in the average unit sales price  complemented by an increase in sales of cubic yards of concrete  which we refer to as units 
the increased average sales price reflects our ability to pass our additional costs to our customers  such as the increased costs of raw materials and transportation of those materials and the change in our category of sales which require higher strength concrete typically used in the commercial and infrastructure segments 
the increased volume in was primarily attributable to our expansion efforts  including the opening of two new concrete batch plants during the year and increased focus to obtain commercial projects 
we provide ready mix concrete to our related party  but the revenue represented only 
of our revenue 
the decrease in related party revenue when compared to was the result of the location of the projects  type of products needed and the availability of product and personnel 
location of the project  type of product needed and the availability of product and personnel are factors which we consider when quoting prices to our customers  including our related party 
based on that criteria  future sales to the related party could increase or decrease in any given year  but are not anticipated to be material 
we expect raw material prices and transport costs associated with those materials to remain stable during and do not foresee spot shortages as we did through and early 
table of contents gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million for from million for and gross margins  as a percent of revenue  increased to in from in gross profit margins can be affected by a variety of factors including customers construction schedules  weather conditions and availability of raw materials 
the increase in gross profit and gross margin during resulted primarily from the expansion of our operations and utilizing new equipment placed in service 
during we anticipate under utilizing new equipment recently placed in service  but long term margins will benefit from the expansion efforts 
our fixed costs will increase in as a result of our expansion efforts and could impact our gross profit margin in the interim as we are bringing the equipment up to full utilization 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase resulted from the additional plant  equipment and vehicles we placed in service in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase resulted primarily from a 
million increase in administrative salaries  wages  bonuses and related payroll taxes  a 
million increase in public company expense  
million increase in bad debt expense and a 
million increase in insurance expense 
interest income and expense 
interest income for increased to 
million from 
million for resulting primarily from an increase in invested cash reserves from our initial public offering 
interest expense decreased in to 
compared to 
million for the decrease in interest expense was related to the repayment of related party debt and repayment of our outstanding balance on our line of credit  thereby reducing interest expense 
interest expense associated with assets used to generate revenue is included in cost of revenue 
we intend to enter into additional financing agreements to acquire equipment and fund working capital when needed  which will increase our overall interest expense in future periods 
income taxes 
the income tax provision for increased to million from million for for  our effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes  non deductible expenses and the domestic production activities deduction 
net income 
net income was million for as compared to a net income of million for the increase in net income resulted from an increase in our average unit sales price and our sales of cubic yards of concrete as discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
revenue improved to million for the year ended december   which we refer to as  from million for the year ended december   which we refer to as the increase in revenue resulted from an increase in the average unit sales price  offset by a decrease in sales of cubic yards of concrete  which we refer to as units 
the increased average sales price reflects our ability to pass our additional costs to our customers  such as the increased costs of raw materials and transportation of those materials 
the decreased volume in was primarily attributable to wet weather conditions during january and february reducing our ability to deliver material to our customers and our customers ability to place the material and a slight general slowing in the residential markets 
we provided ready mix concrete to our related parties  the revenue represented only of our revenue 
the increase in related party revenue when compared to was the result of the location of the project  type of product needed and the availability of product and personnel 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by to million for from million for and gross margins  as a percent of revenue  decreased to in from in gross profit margins can be affected by a variety of factors including customers construction schedules  weather conditions and availability of raw materials 
the increase in gross profit and decrease in the gross margins during resulted primarily from the expansion of our operations and under utilizing new equipment 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased 
million  or  to million for from million for this increase resulted from the additional plant  equipment and vehicles we placed in service in 
table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase resulted primarily from a 
million increase in administrative salaries  wages  bonuses and related payroll taxes  a 
million increase in public company expense and a 
million increase in administrative services fees paid to meadow valley  offset by a 
million decrease in bad debt expense 
interest income and expense 
interest income for increased to 
million from 
million for resulting primarily from an increase in invested cash reserves from our initial public offering 
interest expense decreased in to 
compared to 
million for income taxes 
the income tax provision for was relatively flat at million when compared to for  our effective income tax rate differed from the statutory rate due primarily to state income taxes 
the difference between the amount of the tax provision and the actual cash outlay was due to the net operating loss carry forward 
net income 
net income of million for was relatively flat when compared to liquidity and capital resources our primary need for capital has been to increase the number of mixer trucks in our fleet  to increase the number of concrete batch plant locations  to purchase support equipment at each location  to secure and equip aggregate sources to insure a long term source and quality of the aggregate products used to produce our concrete and to provide working capital to support the expansion of our operations 
as we expand our business  we will continue to utilize the availability of capital offered by financial institutions  in turn increasing our total debt and debt service obligations 
historically  our largest provider of financing has been cit construction  who we refer to as cit 
we believe our working capital and our historical sources of capital will be satisfactory to meet our needs for at least one year from the date of this annual report on form k 
we have a credit facility with cit which provides a million revolving credit facility  as well as million capital expenditure commitment 
the cit revolving credit facility is collateralized by all of our assets as well as the assets of meadow valley  our parent 
under the terms of the agreement  meadow valley is required to maintain a certain level of tangible net worth as well as maintain a ratio of total debt to tangible net worth  and earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
we are also required to maintain a cash flow to current portion of long term debt 
as of december   both meadow valley and ourselves were compliant with the facility covenants 
over the next months  if market conditions warrant  we intend to expand our operations by adding one additional ready mix production plant  in addition to the two plants added during  purchasing related production plant equipment and completing site improvements at each of the new sites  for which we anticipate utilizing the capital expenditure commitment of our cit credit facility 
we also intend to lease an additional to mixer trucks when we add the additional ready mix production facility 
in february  we completed the purchase and installation of needed equipment  which allowed us to begin to produce aggregate products from our pit in the northwest metropolitan las vegas area  which we refer to as lee canyon 
the completion of the pit and the ability to produce aggregates from this location should improve our ability to better service this expanding portion of the las vegas metropolitan area 
as a result of the expansion efforts we have already executed  we have entered into additional debt and operating lease obligations which  in turn  have increased our total fixed minimum monthly payment obligations 
to date we have not been impacted by this increase in our fixed minimum monthly payments as our cash flow from operations has provided an amount in excess of the increase in these payments 
we do not expect this trend to change in  but no assurance can be given that cash flow from operations will be adequate to provide for the cash outflow needed to service all obligations for our expansion efforts 

table of contents the following table sets forth  for the periods presented  certain items from our statements of cash flows 
in thousands for the years ended december  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities cash provided by operating activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount provided by operating activities during the change was primarily due to improved net income  reduction of tax obligations due and payable during the year and the change in depreciation expense year over year offset by deposits made near the end of  which were primarily made to secure the production equipment at our lee canyon facility as mentioned above 
cash used in investing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used by investing activities during the increase in investing activities during was due primarily to the expansion of our production facilities and equipment to be used at those locations 
cash used in financing activities during of 
million represents a million decrease from the amount provided by financing activities during the decrease in financing activities during was the result of not obtaining additional proceeds from a public offering or obtaining extensive debt to fund our expansion efforts 
cash provided by operating activities during of million represents a million decrease from the amount provided by operating activities during the change was primarily due to the increase in our average days outstanding associated with our accounts receivable balance as well as the repayment of our tax obligation to meadow valley 
cash used in investing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used by investing activities during the increase in investing activities during was due primarily to the expansion of our production facilities and equipment to be used at those locations 
cash provided by financing activities during of million represents a million increase from the amount used in financing activities during the increase in financing activities during was the result of receiving the proceeds from the initial public offering offset by the repayment of notes and capital leases as well as the repayment of the amount due to an affiliate 

table of contents summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized as follows payments due by period less than after dollars in thousands total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt interest payments on long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations interest payments are based on the individual interest rates of each obligation  which range from to per annum 
we do not assume an increase in the variable interest rate 
see note line of credit and note notes payable in the notes to the financial statements included in item other long term liabilities include employment contracts with two of our key executive officers that call for annual salaries of  and  through january  respectively  and are to be reviewed annually by our compensation committee 
in addition  other long term liabilities include an administrative services agreement with meadow valley in the amount of  per month expiring december  impact of inflation there have been increases in the cost of our raw materials and the transport of those materials  however  we have been able to pass these additional costs on to our customers 
therefore  we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our operations 
however  additional substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  or material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect our operations in future periods 
furthermore  increased interest rates typically track rising inflation 
to the extent that rising interest rates equate to higher home mortgage rates  which have an impact on construction activity  a material rise in the inflation rate could cause a decline in residential or commercial construction and a negative impact on our business 
critical accounting estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described below and in note to our financial statements included in item 
table of contents reportable segments we currently operate our business within one reportable segment of operation 
all of the revenue from our customers is substantially from the sale of ready mix concrete 
ready mix concrete can have many different variations and characteristics  from the strength of the concrete to its color and consistency 
however  we do not maintain the quantity or dollar amount of each variation of our product sold as the variations in the ready mix concrete sales are simply variations of ready mix concrete 
we also sell sand  aggregate and colored rock from our production facility in moapa  nevada  but the primary purpose of this production facility is to provide us with more control over quality and assurance of timely availability of a portion of the raw materials used in the product we sell to customers 
the revenue generated from the sale of sand  aggregate and colored rock represented less than of our gross revenue for the years ended december  and in addition  we view the market similarities between the phoenix  arizona and the las vegas  nevada metropolitan areas to be of such a similar nature that we do not distinguish between them 
collectibility of account receivables we are required to estimate the collectibility of our account receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer and the related aging of the past due balances 
our provision for bad debt as of december  and amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
the increase in our provision for bad debt as of december  represented the use of our historic bad debt rate  identifying specific accounts potentially uncollectible and write offs in the amount of approximately  during we determine our reserve by using percentages applied to certain types of revenue  as well as a review of individual accounts outstanding and our collection history 
furthermore  if one or more major customer fails to pay us  it would significantly affect our current results as well as future estimates 
we pursue our lien rights to minimize our exposure to delinquent accounts 
valuation of property and equipment we are required to provide property and equipment net of depreciation and amortization expense 
we expense depreciation and amortization utilizing the straight line method  over what we believe to be the estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
the estimated useful lives of property and equipment are batch plants years office buildings years computer equipment years equipment years leasehold improvements years office furniture and equipment years vehicles years the life on any piece of equipment can vary  even within the same category of equipment  due to the quality of the maintenance  care provided by the operator and the general environmental conditions  such as temperature  rain and the terrain conditions to reach the job site where the material is delivered 
we maintain  service and repair approximately of our equipment through the use of our mechanics 
if we inaccurately estimate the life of any given piece of equipment or category of equipment we may be overstating or understating earnings in any given period 
we also review our property  plant and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the impairments are 
table of contents recognized in the period during which they are identified 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities on our balance sheets 
we must calculate the blended tax rate  combining all applicable tax jurisdictions  which can vary over time as a result of the allocation of taxable income between the tax jurisdictions and the changes in tax rates 
we must also assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets  if any  will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent recovery is not likely  must establish a valuation allowance 
furthermore  we are subject to periodic review by domestic tax authorities for audit of our income tax returns 
these audits generally include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the amount and timing of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  including federal and state taxes  we believe we have complied with the rules of the service codes and therefore have not recorded reserves for any possible exposure 
typically the taxing authorities can audit the previous three years of tax returns and in certain situations audit additional years  therefore a significant amount of time may pass before an audit is conducted and fully resolved 
although no audits are currently being conducted  if a taxing authority would require us to amend a prior year s tax return we would record the increase or decrease in our tax obligation in the year in which it is more likely than not to be realized 
classification of leases we follow the standards established by statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  which we will refer to as fas one factor when determining if a lease is an operating lease or a capital lease is the intention from the inception of the lease regarding the final ownership  or transfer of title  of the asset to be leased 
we are currently leasing ready mix trucks under operating lease agreements  since at the inception of those leases we had not intended to take title to those vehicles at the conclusion of the leases 
therefore  we did not request transfer of ownership provisions at the conclusion of the leases such as bargain purchase options or direct transfers of ownership 
since we do not intend to take ownership at the conclusion of the leases and we do not meet the remaining criteria of fas for capitalization  the leases are classified as operating leases 
if we would have desired at the inception of the leases to have the ownership transfer at the conclusion of the leases  we would have classified those leases as capital leases and would have recorded the ready mix trucks as assets on our balance sheet as well as recording the liability as capital lease obligations 
we believe that the lease expense under the operating lease classification approximates the depreciation expense which would have been incurred if the leases would have been classified as capital leases 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires that we quantify misstatements based on their impact on each of our financial statements and related disclosures 
sab no 
is effective as of the end of the fiscal year  allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of january  for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab no 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit and retiree medical plans as an asset or liability in the company s year end balance sheet  with changes in the funded status recognized through comprehensive income in the year in which they occur 
sfas no 
also requires us to measure the funded status of defined benefit and retiree medical plans as of our year end balance sheet date no later than we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
reflects the benefit recognition approach  where a tax benefit is recognized when it is more likely than not to be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect fin no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin no 
r  determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 
r  that became effective beginning the third quarter of fsp fin no 
r clarifies that the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation r shall be based on an analysis of the design of the variable interest entity 
the adoption of this fsp did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this new statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
the fasb has revised its guidance on sfas no 
implementation issues as of march several implementation issues were revised to reflect the issuance of sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  in february sfas no 
allows any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to be carried at fair value in its entirety  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that beneficial interests in securitized financial assets be analyzed to determine whether they are freestanding derivatives or contain an embedded derivative 
sfas no 
also eliminates a prior restriction on the types of passive derivatives that a qualifying special purpose entity is permitted to hold 
sfas no 
is applicable to new or modified financial instruments in fiscal years beginning after september   though the provisions related to fair value accounting for hybrid financial instruments can also be applied to existing instruments 
we do not expect sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
known and anticipated future trends and contingencies we have grown steadily since our inception and we plan to continue to exploit opportunities within our markets 
the key dynamics of employment and population growth within our geographic markets appear to present us with continued growth opportunities 
it appears that demand for construction materials will remain steady and that the supply of raw materials will remain stable as well as prices of the product we provide and the required materials used in the production of concrete 

table of contents in light of the rising need for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current need to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also a trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by it could dramatically affect the nature of our markets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
we do not have foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time we temporarily invest our excess cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
we monitor risk exposure to monies invested in securities in our financial institutions 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk 
our primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to our long term debt obligations 
we manage our exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 
we evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in the fair value of our debt obligations would have been approximately 
million at december  see note line of credit and note notes payable in the accompanying december  financial statements included in item
