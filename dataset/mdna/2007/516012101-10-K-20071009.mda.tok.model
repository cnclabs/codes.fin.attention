part i item description of business general lannett company  inc the company  lannett  we  or us was incorporated in under the laws of the commonwealth of pennsylvania  and reincorporated in as a delaware corporation 
we develop  manufacture  market and distribute generic versions of pharmaceutical products 
the company reports financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis  the most recent being the fiscal year ended june  all references herein to a fiscal year refer to the company s fiscal year ending june the company is focused on increasing our share of the generic pharmaceutical market 
we were able to increase net sales during fiscal by adding new products  and by increasing sales under existing distribution agreements 
we plan to improve our financial performance by expanding our line of generic products  increasing unit sales to current customers and reducing overhead and administrative costs 
some of the new generic products sold by lannett were developed and are manufactured by lannett while other products are manufactured by other companies 
the products manufactured by lannett and those manufactured by others are identified in the section entitled products in item of this form k 
over the past several years  lannett has consistently devoted resources to research and development r d projects  including new generic product offerings 
the costs of these r d efforts are expensed during the periods incurred 
the company believes that such investments may be recovered in future years as it submits applications to the food and drug administration fda  and when it receives marketing approval from the fda to distribute such products 
in addition to using cash generated from its operations  the company has entered into a number of financing agreements with third parties to provide additional cash when needed 
these financing agreements are more fully described in the section entitled liquidity and capital resources in item of this form k 
the company has embarked on a plan to grow in future years 
in addition to organic growth to be achieved through its own r d efforts  the company has also initiated marketing projects with other companies in order to expand future revenue projections 
the company expects that its growing list of generic drugs under development will drive future growth 
the company also intends to use the infrastructure it has created  and to continually devote resources to additional r d projects 
the following strategies highlight lannett s plan research and development process there are numerous stages in the generic drug development process formulation and analytical method development after a drug candidate is selected for future sales  product development chemists perform various experiments on the incorporation of active ingredients into a dosage form 
these experiments will result in the creation of a number of product formulations to determine which formula will be most suitable for the company s subsequent development process 
various formulations are tested in the laboratory to measure results against the innovator drug 
during this time  the company may use reverse engineering methods on samples of the innovator drug to determine the type and quantity of inactive ingredients 
during the formulation phase  the company s research and development chemists begin to develop an analytical  laboratory testing method 
the successful development of this test method will allow the company to test developmental and commercial batches of the product in the future 
all of the information used in the final formulation  including the analytical test methods adopted for the generic drug candidate  will be included as part of the chemical  manufacturing and controls section of the abbreviated new drug application anda submitted to the fda in the generic drug application 
scale up after the product development scientists and the r d chemists agree on a final formulation to use in moving the drug candidate forward in the developmental process  the company will attempt to increase the batch size of the product 
the batch size represents the standard magnitude to be used in manufacturing a batch of the product 
the determination of batch size will affect the amount of raw material that is input into the manufacturing process and the number of expected tablets or capsules to be created during the production cycle 
the company attempts to determine batch size based on the amount of active ingredient in each dosage  the available production equipment and unit sales projections 
the scaled up batch is then generally produced in the company s commercial manufacturing facilities 
during this manufacturing process  the company will document the equipment used  the amount of time in each major processing step and any other steps needed to consistently produce a batch of that product 
this information  generally referred to as the validated manufacturing process  will be included in the company s generic drug application submitted to the fda 
clinical testing after a successful scale up of the generic drug batch  the company then schedules and performs clinical testing procedures on the product if required by the fda 
these procedures  which are generally outsourced to third parties  include testing the absorption of the generic product in the human bloodstream compared to the absorption of the innovator drug 
the results of this testing are then documented and reported to the company to determine the success of the generic drug product 
success  in this context  means the successful comparison of the company s product related to the innovator product 
since bioequivalence and a stable formula are the primary requirements for a generic drug approval assuming the manufacturing plant is in compliance with the fda s good manufacturing quality standards  lengthy and costly clinical trials proving safety and efficacy  which are generally required by the fda for innovator drug approvals  are unnecessary for generic companies 
if the results are successful  the company will continue the collection of documentation and information for assembly of the drug application 
submission of the anda for fda review and approval the anda process became formalized under the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  also known as the hatch waxman act hatch waxman act 
an anda represents a generic drug company s application to the fda to manufacture and or distribute a drug that is the generic equivalent to an already approved brand named innovator drug 
once bioequivalence studies are complete  the generic drug company submits an anda to the fda for marketing approval 
in a presentation entitled  cder update  given during the windhover fda cms summit  stephen k 
galson  director of the center for drug evaluation and research  cited the median approval time for a new anda in fiscal at months 
this figure was slightly longer than the median approval time of however  there is no guarantee that the fda will approve a company s anda or that any approval will be given within this time frame 
when a generic drug company files an anda with the fda  it must certify that no patents are listed in the orange book  the fda s reference listing of approved drugs  and listed patents 
an anda filer must certify  with respect to each application whether the filer is challenging a patent either that no patent was filed for the listed drug a paragraph i certification  that the patent has expired a paragraph ii certification  that the patent will expire on a specified date and the anda filer will not market the drug until that date a paragraph iii certification  or that the patent is invalid or would not be infringed by the manufacture  use  or sale of the new drug a paragraph iv certification 
a paragraph iv certification can trigger an automatic month stay of the anda if the innovator company files a claim 
it will delay the approval of the generic company s anda 
currently  lannett has filed no paragraph iv certifications with its andas 
over the past several years  the company has hired additional personnel in product development  production  formulation and the r d laboratory 
lannett believes that its ability to select appropriate products for development  develop such products on a timely basis  obtain fda approval  and achieve economies in production will be critical for its success in the generic industry 
the strategy involves a combination of decisions focusing on long term profitability and a secure market position with fewer challenges from competitors 
competition in generic pharmaceutical manufacturing will continue to grow as more pharmaceutical products lose patent protection 
however  the company believes that with strong technical know how  low overhead expenses  and efficient product development  manufacturing and marketing  it can remain competitive 
it is the intention of the company to reinvest as much capital as possible to develop new products since the success of any generic pharmaceutical manufacturer depends on its ability to continually introduce new generic products to the market 
over time  if a generic drug market for a specific product remains stable and consumer demand remains consistent  it is likely that additional generic manufacturing companies will pursue the generic product by developing it  submitting an anda  and potentially receiving marketing approval from the fda 
if this occurs  the generic competition for the drug increases  and a company s market share may drop 
in addition to reduced unit sales  the unit selling price may also drop due to the product s availability from additional suppliers 
this may have the effect of reducing a generic company s future net sales of the product 
due to these factors that may potentially affect a generic company s future results of operations  the ability to properly assess the competitive effect of new products  including market share  the number of competitors and the generic unit price erosion  is critical to a generic company s r d plan 
a generic company may be able to reduce the potential exposure to competitive influences that negatively affect its sales and profits by having several drug candidates in its r d pipeline 
as such  a generic company may be able to avoid becoming materially dependent on the sales of one drug 
please refer to the following section entitled products for more descriptive information on the products the company currently produces or sells 
unlike the branded  innovator companies  lannett currently does not own proprietary drug patents 
however  the typical intellectual property in the generic drug industry are the andas that generic drug companies own 
validated pharmaceutical capabilities lannett s manufacturing facility consists of  square feet on acres owned by the company 
in addition  the company owns a  square foot building located within mile of the corporate office 
the second building contains packaging  warehouse and shipping functions  r d and a number of administrative functions 
the manufacturing facility of lannett s wholly owned subsidiary  cody laboratories  inc cody consists of  square feet on acres in cody  wyoming 
cody leases the facility from cody lci realty  llc  a limited liability company which is owned by lannett and by an affiliate of cody labs 
many fda regulations relating to current good manufacturing practices cgmp have been adopted by the company in the last several years 
in designing its facilities  full attention was given to material flow  equipment and automation  quality control and inspection 
a granulator  an automatic film coating machine  high speed tablet presses  blenders  encapsulators  fluid bed dryers  high shear mixers and high speed bottle filling are a few examples of the sophisticated product development  manufacturing and packaging equipment the company uses 
in addition  the company s quality control laboratory facilities are equipped with high precision instruments  like automated high pressure liquid chromatographs  gas chromatographs  robots and laser particle sizers 
lannett continues to pursue its comprehensive plan for improving and maintaining quality control and quality assurance programs for its pharmaceutical development and manufacturing facilities 
the fda periodically inspects the company s production facilities to determine the company s compliance with the fda s manufacturing standards 
typically  after the fda completes its inspection  it will issue the company a report  entitled a form  containing the fda s observations of possible violations of cgmp 
such observations may be minor or severe in nature 
the degree of severity of the observation is generally determined by the time necessary to remediate the cgmp violation  any consequences upon the consumer of the company s drug products  and whether the observation is subject to a warning letter from the fda 
by strictly enforcing the various fda guidelines  namely good laboratory practices  standard operating procedures and cgmp  the company has successfully kept the number of observations in its fda inspection at a minimal level 
the company believes that such observations are minor in nature  and will be remediated in a timely fashion with no material effect on its results of operations 
sales and customer relationships the company sells its pharmaceutical products to generic pharmaceutical distributors  drug wholesalers  chain drug retailers  private label distributors  mail order pharmacies  other pharmaceutical manufacturers  managed care organizations  hospital buying groups and health maintenance organizations 
it promotes its products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications  and bids 
the company also licenses the marketing of its products to other manufacturers and or marketers in private label agreements 
the company continues to expand its sales to the major chain drug stores 
lannett is recognized by its customers as a dependable supplier of high quality generic pharmaceuticals 
the company s policy of maintaining an adequate inventory and fulfilling orders in a timely manner has contributed to this reputation 
management the company has been focused on increasing the size and quality of its management team in anticipation of continued growth 
managers from large  established  brand pharmaceutical companies as well as competing generic companies have been brought in to complement the skills and knowledge of the existing management team 
as the company continues to grow  additional managers may need to be added to the team 
we intend to hire the best people available to expand the knowledge and expertise within the company  in order to further accomplish specific company goals 
products as of the date of this filing  the company manufactured and or distributed the following products name of product medical indication equivalent brand acetazolamide tablets glaucoma diamox baclofen tablets muscle relaxer lioresal butalbital  aspirin and caffeine capsules migraine headache fiorinal butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules migraine headache fiorinal w codeine clindamycin hcl capsules antibiotic cleocin danazol capsules endometriosis danocrine dicyclomine tablets capsules irritable bowels bentyl digoxin tablets congestive heart failure lanoxin diphenoxylate with atropine sulfate tablets diarrhea lomotil doxycycline tablets antibiotic adoxa doxycycline hyclate tablets antibiotic periostat hydromorphone hcl tablets pain management dilaudid levothyroxine sodium tablets thyroid deficiency levoxyl synthroid methyltestoterone esterified estrogens tablets hormone replacement estratest morphine sulfate oral solution pain management roxanol oxycodone hcl oral solution pain management roxicodone phentermine hcl tablets weight loss adipex p name of product medical indication equivalent brand pilocarpine hcl tablets dryness of the mouth salagen primidone tablets epilepsy mysoline probenecid tablets gout benemid sulfamethoxazole w trimethoprim antibacterial bactrim terbutaline sulfate tablets bronchospasms brethine unithroid tablets thyroid deficiency n a key products all of the products currently manufactured and or sold by the company are prescription products 
of the products listed above  those containing butalbital  digoxin  primidone and levothyroxine sodium were the company s key products  contributing more than  and of the company s total net sales in fiscal  and respectively 
in fiscal  the company began selling sulfamethoxazole w trimethoprim smz tmp 
because of a market opportunity  sales of smz tmp grew from of sales in to of sales in this number is not included in the above key products because the opportunity is no longer available to the company after prices declined sharply 
the decline in this percentage of key products since is due to our focus on expanding the number of products sold 
the company has two products containing butalbital 
one of the products  butalbital with aspirin and caffeine capsules  has been manufactured and sold by lannett for more than nine years 
the other butalbital product  butalbital with aspirin  caffeine and codeine phosphate capsules is manufactured by jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp 
lannett began buying this product from jsp and selling it to its customers in december both products  which are in orally administered capsule dosage forms  are prescribed to treat tension headaches caused by contractions of the muscles in the neck and shoulder area and migraine 
the drug is prescribed primarily for adults of various demographic backgrounds 
migraine headache is an increasingly prevalent condition in the united states 
as conditions continue to grow  the demand for effective medical treatments will continue to grow 
common side effects of drugs which contain butalbital include dizziness and drowsiness 
the company notes that although new innovator drugs to treat migraine headaches have been introduced by brand name drug companies  there is still a loyal following of doctors and consumers who prefer to use butalbital products for treatment 
as the brand name companies continue to promote products containing butalbital  like fiorinal  the company expects to continue to produce and sell its generic butalbital products 
digoxin tablets are produced and marketed with two different potencies and milligrams per tablet 
this product is manufactured by jsp 
lannett began buying this product from jsp and selling it to its customers in september digoxin tablets are used to treat congestive heart failure in patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds 
the beneficial effects of digoxin result from direct actions on the cardiac muscle  as well as indirect actions on the cardiovascular system mediated by effects on the autonomic nervous system 
side effects of digoxin may include apathy  blurred vision  changes in heartbeat  confusion  dizziness  headaches  loss of appetite  nausea  vomiting and weakness 
primidone tablets are produced and marketed with two different potencies and milligrams per tablet 
this product was developed and is manufactured by lannett 
lannett has been manufacturing and selling primidone milligram tablets for more than seven years 
lannett began selling primidone milligram tablets in june both products  which are in orally administered tablet dosage forms  are prescribed to treat convulsion and seizures in epileptic patients of all ages and demographic backgrounds 
common side effects of primidone include lack of muscle coordination  vertigo and severe dizziness 
the company s products containing levothyroxine sodium tablets are produced and marketed with eleven different potencies 
in addition to generic levothyroxine sodium tablets  the company also markets and distributes unithroid tablets  a branded version of levothyroxine sodium tablets  which is produced and marketed with eleven different potencies 
both levothyroxine sodium products are manufactured by jsp 
lannett began buying generic levothyroxine sodium tablets from jsp and selling it to its customers in april in september  the company began buying the branded unithroid tablets from jsp and selling it to its customers 
levothyroxine sodium tablets are used to treat hypothyroidism and other thyroid disorders 
it remains one of the most prescribed drugs in the united states with over million patients of various ages and demographic backgrounds 
side effects from levothyroxine sodium are rare  but may include allergic reactions  such as rash or hives 
in late june of  jsp received a letter from the fda approving its supplemental application for generic bioequivalence to levoxyl 
in december  jsp received a letter from the fda approving its supplemental application for generic bioequivalence to synthroid 
with its distribution of these products  lannett competes in a market which is currently controlled by two branded levothyroxine sodium tablet products abbott laboratories synthroid and monarch pharmaceutical s levoxyl as well as generic competition from mylan laboratories and sandoz 
new products lannett received anda approval from the fda and commenced marketing of additional product during fiscal we received approvals in fiscal following are more specific details regarding our latest approvals 
market data is obtained from wolters kluwer 
in january  lannett began distributing meloxicam  the generic equivalent of boehringer ingelheim s mobic 
sales of meloxicam  a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis  were approximately billion for the twelve months ended november  according to wolters kluwer 
in april  lannett received a letter from the fda with approval to market and launch danazol mg and mg capsules 
danazol is the generic version of danocrine and is used for the treatment of endometriosis amenable to hormonal management 
according to wolters kluwer  total sales of generic danazol capsules were million in additional products are currently under development 
these products are either orally administered  solid dosage products ie tablet capsule or oral solutions  topicals or parentarels designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  clinical testing and fda review 
the cost associated with each product currently under development is dependent on numerous factors not limited to the following the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the price of the raw materials  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies depending on the fda s orange book classification and other developmental factors 
the overall cost to develop a new generic product varies in range from  to million 
in addition  as one of the oldest generic drug manufacturers in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling them 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  the raw material supplier or another major feature of the previously approved anda 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development or manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
the following table summarizes key information related to the company s r d products 
the column headings are defined as follows stage of r d defines the current stage of the r d product in the development process  as of the date of this filing 
regulatory requirement defines whether the r d product is or is expected to be a new anda submission  an anda supplement  or a grand fathered product not requiring specific fda approval 
number of products defines the number of products in r d at the stage noted 
in this context  a product means any finished dosage form  including all potencies  containing the same api or combination of apis and which represents a generic version of the same reference listed drug rld or innovator drug  identified in the fda s orange book 
stage of r d regulatory requirement number of products fda review anda fda review anda supplement clinical testing anda scale up grand fathered scale up anda supplement scale up anda formulation method development anda raw materials and finished goods inventory suppliers the raw materials used by the company in the production process consist of pharmaceutical chemicals in various forms and are generally available from several sources 
fda approval is required in connection with the process of using most active ingredient suppliers 
in addition to the raw materials purchased for the production process  the company purchases certain finished dosage inventories  including capsule  tablet  and oral liquid products 
the company then sells these finished dosage products directly to its customers along with the finished dosage products internally manufactured 
if suppliers of a certain material or finished product are limited  the company will generally take certain precautionary steps to avoid a disruption in supply  such as finding a secondary supplier or ordering larger quantities 
the company s primary finished product inventory supplier is jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp  in bohemia  new york 
purchases of finished goods inventory from jsp accounted for approximately of the company s inventory purchases in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal on march   the company entered into an agreement with jsp for the exclusive distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock 
the jsp products covered under the agreement included butalbital  aspirin  caffeine with codeine phosphate capsules  digoxin tablets and levothyroxine sodium tablets  sold generically and under the brand name unithroid 
the term of the agreement is ten years  beginning on march  and continuing through march  refer to the materials contract footnote to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the terms  conditions  and financial impact of this agreement 
during the term of the agreement  the company is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase minimum dollar quantities of jsp s products being distributed by the company 
the minimum quantity to be purchased in the first year of the agreement was million 
thereafter  the minimum purchase quantity increases by million per year up to million for the last year of the ten year contract 
the company has met the minimum purchase requirement for the first three years of the contract  but there is no guarantee that the company will be able to continue to do so in the future 
if the company does not meet the minimum purchase requirements  jsp s sole remedy is to terminate the agreement 
in august  the company signed an agreement with a finished goods provider to purchase  at fixed prices  and distribute a certain generic pharmaceutical product in the united states 
purchases of finished goods inventory from this provider accounted for approximately of the company s costs of purchased inventory in fiscal  and in the term of the agreement is three years  beginning on august  and continuing through august  during the term of the agreement  the company has committed to provide a rolling twelve month forecast of the estimated product requirements to this provider 
the first three months of the rolling twelve month forecast are binding and constitute a firm order 
the company signed supply and development agreements with olive healthcare of india  orion pharma of finland  azad pharma ag of switzerland  pharmaseed in israel and banner pharmacaps in the united states 
the company is also in negotiations with companies in israel for similar new product initiatives in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by third parties 
customers and marketing the company sells its products primarily to wholesale distributors  generic drug distributors  mail order pharmacies  group purchasing organizations  chain drug stores  and other pharmaceutical companies 
the industry s largest wholesale distributors  mckesson  cardinal health  and amerisource bergen  accounted for   and  respectively  of net sales in fiscal the company s largest chain drug store customer  walgreens  accounted for of net sales in fiscal the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial condition  and has experienced no significant collection problems to date 
generally  the company requires no collateral from its customers 
sales to these wholesale customers include indirect sales  which represent sales to third party entities  such as independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price 
this credit is called a chargeback 
for more information on chargebacks  refer to the section entitled chargebacks in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
these indirect sale transactions are recorded on lannett s books as sales to the wholesale customers 
the company believes that retail level consumer demand dictates the total volume of sales for various products 
in the event that wholesale and retail customers adjust their purchasing volumes  the company believes that consumer demand will be fulfilled by other wholesale or retail sources of supply 
as such  lannett attempts to obtain strong relationships with most of the major retail chains  wholesale distributors  and mail order pharmacies in order to facilitate the supply of the company s products through whatever channel the consumer prefers 
although the company has agreements with customers governing the transaction terms of its sales  there are no minimum purchase quantities with these agreements 
the company promotes its products through direct sales  trade shows  trade publications  and bids 
the company also markets its products through private label arrangements  whereby lannett produces its products with a label containing the name and logo of a customer 
this practice is commonly referred to as private label business 
it allows the company to expand on its own internal sales efforts by using the marketing services from other well respected pharmaceutical dosage suppliers 
the focus of the company s sales efforts is the relationships it creates with its customer accounts 
strong customer relationships have created a positive platform for lannett to increase its sales volumes 
advertising in the generic pharmaceutical industry is generally limited to trade publications  read by retail pharmacists  wholesale purchasing agents and other pharmaceutical decision makers 
historically and in fiscal   and  the company s advertising expenses were immaterial 
when the customer and the company s sales representatives make contact  the company will generally offer to supply the customer its products at fixed prices 
if accepted  the customer s purchasing department will coordinate the purchase  receipt and distribution of the products throughout its distribution centers and retail outlets 
once a customer accepts the company s supply of product  the customer generally expects a high standard of service 
this service standard includes shipping product in a timely manner on receipt of customer purchase orders  maintaining convenient and effective customer service functions  and retaining a mutually beneficial dialogue of communication 
the company believes that although the generic pharmaceutical industry is a commodity industry  where price is the primary factor for sales success  these additional service standards are equally important to the customers that rely on a consistent source of supply 
competition the manufacture and distribution of generic pharmaceutical products is a highly competitive industry 
competition is based primarily on price  service and quality 
the company competes primarily on this basis  for example staying competitive  providing superior customer service from fulfilling customer s in critical need of inventory  carrying excess finished goods inventory and providing added value by insuring the company s products are available from national suppliers as well as our own warehouse 
the modernization of its facilities  hiring of experienced staff  and implementation of inventory and quality control programs have improved the company s competitive position over the past five years 
the company competes with other manufacturers and marketers of generic and brand drugs 
each product manufactured and or sold by lannett has a different set of competitors 
the list below identifies the companies with which lannett primarily competes for each of its major products 
product primary competitors butalbital with aspirin and caffeine  with and without codeine phosphate capsules watson pharmaceuticals  breckenridge pharmaceutical manufactured by anabolic laboratories digoxin tablets glaxosmithkline  actavis marketed by bertek pharmaceuticals  caraco pharmaceutical laboratories doxycycline tablets par pharmaceuticals  ranbaxy laboratories levothyroxine sodium tablets abbott laboratories  monarch pharmaceuticals  mylan laboratories  sandoz  forest laboratories primidone tablets watson pharmaceuticals  qualitest pharmaceuticals  url  westward pharmaceuticals sulfamethoxazole w trimethoprim url mutual pharmaceuticals  sandoz  vista  teva unithroid tablets abbott laboratories  monarch pharmaceuticals  mylan laboratories  sandoz government regulation pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to extensive regulation by the federal government  principally by the fda and the drug enforcement agency dea and to a lesser extent  by other federal regulatory bodies and state governments 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substance act  and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  pricing  advertising  and promotion of the company s generic drug products 
noncompliance with applicable regulations can result in fines  recall and seizure of products  total or partial suspension of production  personal and or corporate prosecution and debarment  and refusal of the government to approve new drug applications 
the fda also has the authority to revoke previously approved drug products 
generally  fda approval is required before a prescription drug can be marketed 
a new drug is one not generally recognized by qualified experts as safe and effective for its intended use 
new drugs are typically developed and submitted to the fda by companies expecting to brand the product and sell it as a new medical treatment 
the fda review process for new drugs is very extensive and requires a substantial investment to research and test the drug candidate 
however  less burdensome approval procedures may be used for generic equivalents 
typically  the investment required to develop a generic drug is less costly than the brand innovator drug 
there are currently three ways to obtain fda approval of a drug new drug applications nda unless one of the two procedures discussed in the following paragraphs is available  a manufacturer must conduct and submit to the fda complete clinical studies to establish a drug s safety and efficacy 
abbreviated new drug applications anda an anda is similar to an nda except that the fda generally waives the requirement of complete clinical studies of safety and efficacy 
however  it may require bioavailability and bioequivalence studies 
bioavailability indicates the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a drug in the bloodstream needed to produce a therapeutic effect 
bioequivalence compares one drug product with another and indicates if the rate of absorption and the levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body are within prescribed statistical limits to those of a previously approved drug 
under the hatch waxman act  an anda may be submitted for a drug on the basis that it is the equivalent of an approved drug regardless of when such other drug was approved 
in addition to establishing a new anda procedure  this act created statutory protections for approved brand name drugs 
under the act  an anda for a generic drug may not be made effective until all relevant product and use patents for the brand name drug have expired or have been determined to be invalid 
prior to this act  the fda gave no consideration to the patent status of a previously approved drug 
additionally  the hatch waxman act extends for up to five years the term of a product or use patent covering a drug to compensate the patent holder for the reduction of the effective market life of a patent due to federal regulatory review 
with respect to certain drugs not covered by patents  the act sets specified time periods of two to ten years during which andas for generic drugs cannot become effective or  under certain circumstances  cannot be filed if the branded drug was approved after december  lannett  like most other generic drug companies  uses the anda process for the submission of its developmental generic drug candidates 
paper new drug applications paper nda for a drug that is identical to a drug first approved after  a prospective manufacturer need not go through the full nda procedure 
instead  it may demonstrate safety and efficacy by relying on published literature and reports 
the manufacturer must also submit  if the fda so requires  bioavailability or bioequivalence data illustrating that the generic drug formulation produces the same effects  within an acceptable range  as the previously approved innovator drug 
because published literature to support the safety and efficacy of post drugs may not be available  this procedure is of limited utility to generic drug manufacturers and the resulting approved product will not be interchangeable with the innovator drug as an anda drug would be unless bioeqivalency testing were undertaken and approved by fda 
moreover  the utility of paper ndas has been further diminished by the recently broadened availability of the anda process  as described above 
among the requirements for new drug approval is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer s methods conform to the fda s current good manufacturing practice 
the cgmp regulations must be followed at all times during which the approved drug is manufactured 
in complying with the standards set forth in the cgmp regulations  the company must continue to expend time  money  and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance 
failure to comply with the cgmp regulations risks possible fda action  including but not limited to  the seizure of noncomplying drug products or  through the department of justice  enjoining the manufacture of such products 
the company is also subject to federal  state  and local laws of general applicability  such as laws regulating working conditions and the storage  transportation  or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances  hazardous waste  or environmental contaminants 
the company monitors its compliance with all environmental laws 
the company is in substantial compliance with all regulatory bodies 
research and development the company incurred research and development r d expenses of approximately  in   in  and  in the r d spending includes spending on bioequivalence studies  internal development resources  as well as outsourced development 
while the company manages all r d from our offices in philadelphia  we have also been taking advantage of favorable development costs in other countries 
in the current fiscal year  we have engaged olive healthcare  an india based manufacturer and exporter of pharmaceutical products

risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and others are discussed elsewhere in this report 
these and other risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
if we are unable to successfully develop or commercialize new products  our operating results will suffer 
our future results of operations will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new generic products in a timely manner 
there are numerous difficulties in developing and commercializing new products  including developing  testing and manufacturing products in compliance with regulatory standards in a timely manner  receiving requisite regulatory approvals for such products in a timely manner  the availability  on commercially reasonable terms  of raw materials  including active pharmaceutical ingredients and other key ingredients  developing and commercializing a new product is time consuming  costly and subject to numerous factors that may delay or prevent the successful commercialization of new products  experiencing delays or unanticipated costs  and commercializing generic products may be substantially delayed by the listing with the fda of patents that have the effect of potentially delaying approval of the off patent product by up to months  and in some cases  such patents have issued and been listed with the fda after the key chemical patent on the branded drug product has expired or been litigated  causing additional delays in obtaining approval 
as a result of these and other difficulties  products currently in development by lannett may or may not receive the regulatory approvals necessary for marketing 
if any of our products  when developed and approved  cannot be successfully or timely commercialized  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we cannot guarantee that any investment we make in developing products will be recouped  even if we are successful in commercializing those products 
our gross profit may fluctuate from period to period depending upon our product sales mix  our product pricing  and our costs to manufacture or purchase products 
our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows depend to a significant extent upon our product sales mix 
our sales of products that we manufacture tend to create higher gross margins than do the products we purchase and resell 
as a result  our sales mix will significantly impact our gross profit from period to period 
factors that may cause our sales mix to vary include the amount of new product introductions  marketing exclusivity  if any  which may be obtained on certain new products  the level of competition in the marketplace for certain products  the availability of raw materials and finished products from our suppliers  and the scope and outcome of governmental regulatory action that may involve us 
the profitability of our product sales is also dependent upon the prices we are able to charge for our products  the costs to purchase products from third parties  and our ability to manufacture our products in a cost effective manner 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative and regulatory efforts  our sales of generic products may suffer 
many branded pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition 
these efforts have included pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of one patent which could extend patent protection for additional years or otherwise delay the launch of generics  using the citizen petition process to request amendments to fda standards  seeking changes to us pharmacopoeia  an organization which publishes industry recognized compendia of drug standards  attaching patent extension amendments to non related federal legislation  and engaging in state by state initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs  which could have an impact on products that we are developing 
if branded pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means  our sales may decline 
if we experience a material decline in product sales  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows will suffer 
third parties may claim that we infringe their proprietary rights and may prevent us from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
the manufacture  use and sale of new products that are the subject of conflicting patent rights have been the subject of substantial litigation in the pharmaceutical industry 
these lawsuits relate to the validity and infringement of patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
we may have to defend against charges that we violated patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
this is especially true in the case of generic products on which the patent covering the branded product is expiring  an area where infringement litigation is prevalent  and in the case of new branded products where a competitor has obtained patents for similar products 
litigation may be costly and time consuming  and could divert the attention of our management and technical personnel 
in addition  if we infringe on the rights of others  we could lose our right to develop or manufacture products or could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties 
although the parties to patent and intellectual property disputes in the pharmaceutical industry have often settled their disputes through licensing or similar arrangements  the costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that the necessary licenses would be available to us on terms we believe to be acceptable 
as a result  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling a number of our products  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies from key suppliers that in some cases may be the only source of finished products or raw materials  our ability to deliver our products to the market may be impeded 
we are required to identify the supplier s of all the raw materials for our products in our applications with the fda 
to the extent practicable  we attempt to identify more than one supplier in each drug application 
however  some products and raw materials are available only from a single source and  in some of our drug applications  only one supplier of products and raw materials has been identified  even in instances where multiple sources exist 
to the extent any difficulties experienced by our suppliers cannot be resolved within a reasonable time  and at reasonable cost  or if raw materials for a particular product become unavailable from an approved supplier and we are required to qualify a new supplier with the fda  our profit margins and market share for the affected product could decrease  as well as delay our development and sales and marketing efforts 
our policies regarding returns  allowances and chargebacks  and marketing programs adopted by wholesalers  may reduce our revenues in future fiscal periods 
based on industry practice  generic drug manufacturers have liberal return policies and have been willing to give customers post sale inventory allowances 
under these arrangements  from time to time  we give our customers credits on our generic products that our customers hold in inventory after we have decreased the market prices of the same generic products due to competitive pricing 
therefore  if new competitors enter the marketplace and significantly lower the prices of any of their competing products  we would likely reduce the price of our product 
as a result  we would be obligated to provide credits to our customers who are then holding inventories of such products  which could reduce sales revenue and gross margin for the period the credit is provided 
like our competitors  we also give credits for chargebacks to wholesalers that have contracts with us for their sales to hospitals  group purchasing organizations  pharmacies or other customers 
a chargeback is the difference between the price the wholesaler pays and the price that the wholesaler s end customer pays for a product 
although we establish reserves based on our prior experience and our best estimates of the impact that these policies may have in subsequent periods  we cannot ensure that our reserves are adequate or that actual product returns  allowances and chargebacks will not exceed our estimates 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involves the risk of product liability claims by consumers and other third parties  and insurance against such potential claims is expensive and may be difficult to obtain 
the design  development  manufacture and sale of our products involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and the associated adverse publicity 
insurance coverage is expensive and may be difficult to obtain  and may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  or at all 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance for our products in amounts we believe to be commercially reasonable  if the coverage limits of these insurance policies are not adequate  a claim brought against lannett  whether covered by insurance or not  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
rising insurance costs could negatively impact profitability 
the cost of insurance  including workers compensation  product liability and general liability insurance  have risen in prior years and may increase in the future 
in response  we may increase deductibles and or decrease certain coverages to mitigate these costs 
these increases  and our increased risk due to increased deductibles and reduced coverages  could have a negative impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the loss of our key personnel could cause our business to suffer 
the success of our present and future operations will depend  to a significant extent  upon the experience  abilities and continued services of key personnel 
if the employment of any of our current key personnel is terminated  we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract and replace the employee with the same caliber of key personnel 
as such  we have entered into employment agreements with all of our senior executive officers 
significant balances of intangible assets  including product rights acquired  are subject to impairment testing and may result in impairment charges  which will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our acquired contractual rights to market and distribute products are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization and related impairment charges identified to date 
we determined the initial cost by referring to the original fair value of the assets exchanged 
future amortization periods for product rights are based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired products 
such factors include the product s position in its life cycle  the existence or absence of like products in the market  various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms 
significant changes to any of these factors would require us to perform an additional impairment test on the affected asset and  if evidence of impairment exists  we would be required to take an impairment charge with respect to the asset 
such a charge would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
extensive industry regulation has had  and will continue to have  a significant impact on our business  especially our product development  manufacturing and distribution capabilities 
all pharmaceutical companies  including lannett  are subject to extensive  complex  costly and evolving regulation by the federal government  principally the fda and to a lesser extent by the dea and state government agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the controlled substances act and other federal statutes and regulations govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  packing  labeling  storing  record keeping  safety  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of our products 
under these regulations  we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities  procedures and operations and or the testing of our products by the fda  the dea and other authorities  which conduct periodic inspections to confirm that we are in compliance with all applicable regulations 
in addition  the fda conducts pre approval and post approval reviews and plant inspections to determine whether our systems and processes are in compliance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  and other fda regulations 
following such inspections  the fda may issue notices on form that could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection 
a form notice is generally issued at the conclusion of a fda inspection and lists conditions the fda inspectors believe may violate cgmp or other fda regulations 
fda guidelines specify that a warning letter is issued only for violations of regulatory significance for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action 
any such sanctions  if imposed  could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
under certain circumstances  the fda also has the authority to revoke previously granted drug approvals 
similar sanctions as detailed above may be available to the fda under a consent decree  depending upon the actual terms of such decree 
although we have instituted internal compliance programs  if these programs do not meet regulatory agency standards or if compliance is deemed deficient in any significant way  it could materially harm our business 
certain of our vendors are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections 
the process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products is rigorous  time consuming and costly  and we cannot predict the extent to which we may be affected by legislative and regulatory developments 
we are dependent on receiving fda and other governmental or third party approvals prior to manufacturing  marketing and shipping our products 
consequently  there is always the chance that we will not obtain fda or other necessary approvals  or that the rate  timing and cost of such approvals  will adversely affect our product introduction plans or results of operations 
we carry inventories of certain product s in anticipation of launch  and if such product s are not subsequently launched  we may be required to write off the related inventory 
federal regulation of arrangements between manufacturers of branded and generic products could adversely affect our business 
as part of the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of  companies are now required to file with the federal trade commission and the department of justice certain types of agreements entered into between brand and generic pharmaceutical companies related to the manufacture  marketing and sale of generic versions of branded drugs 
this new requirement could affect the manner in which generic drug manufacturers resolve intellectual property litigation and other disputes with branded pharmaceutical companies and could result generally in an increase in private party litigation against pharmaceutical companies or additional investigations or proceedings by the ftc or other governmental authorities 
the impact of this new requirement and the potential private party lawsuits associated with arrangements between brand name and generic drug manufacturers is uncertain  and could adversely affect our business 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
we face strong competition in our generic product business 
revenues and gross profit derived from the sales of generic pharmaceutical products tend to follow a pattern based on certain regulatory and competitive factors 
as patents for brand name products and related exclusivity periods expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval for generic equivalents of such products is generally able to achieve significant market penetration 
as competing off patent manufacturers receive regulatory approvals on similar products or as brand manufacturers launch generic versions of such products for which no separate regulatory approval is required  market share  revenues and gross profit typically decline  in some cases dramatically 
accordingly  the level of market share  revenue and gross profit attributable to a particular generic product is normally related to the number of competitors in that product s market and the timing of that product s regulatory approval and launch  in relation to competing approvals and launches 
consequently  we must continue to develop and introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner to maintain our revenues and gross margins 
sales of our products may continue to be adversely affected by the continuing consolidation of our distribution network and the concentration of our customer base 
our principal customers are wholesale drug distributors and major retail drug store chains 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the us this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains 
as a result  a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market  and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased 
we expect that consolidation of drug wholesalers and retailers will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on drug manufacturers  including lannett 
for the year ended june   our three largest customers accounted for  and respectively  of our net sales 
the loss of any of these customers could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition and our cash flows 
in addition  the company has no long term supply agreements with its customers which would require them to purchase our products

any compliance costs which may be incurred are contingent upon the results of future site monitoring and will be charged to operations when incurred 
no compliance costs were incurred during the years ended june   and pursuant to a pennsylvania department of revenue the department sales and use tax audit  the department assessed use tax in the amount of  plus interest and penalties 
the total due per the audit is  although interest continues to accrue until paid 
a petition for reassessment has been filed with the board of appeals  an administrative board 
at this point  management is waiting for a hearing to be scheduled by the board 
only certain audit issues have been raised in the petition 
lannett is also contesting the assessed penalties which total approximately  at this point  management has estimated the minimum liability resulting from this audit will be  as has accrued this liability as of june  the company is currently engaged in several civil actions as a co defendant with many other manufacturers of diethylstilbestrol des  a synthetic hormone 
prior litigation established that the company s pro rata share of any liability is less than one tenth of one percent 
due to the fact that prior litigation established the market share method of prorating liability amongst the companies that manufactured des during the drug s commercial distribution  which ended in  management has accepted this method as the most reasonably expected method of determining liability for future outcomes of claims 
the company was represented in many of these actions by the insurance company with which the company maintained coverage subject to limits of liability during the time period that damages were alleged to have occurred 
the insurance company denies coverage for actions alleging involvement of the company filed after january  with respect to these actions  the company paid nominal damages or stipulated to its pro rata share of any liability 
the company has either settled or is currently defending over such claims 
at this time  management is unable to estimate a range of loss  if any  related to these actions 
management believes that the outcome of these cases will not have a material adverse impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
in addition to the matters reported herein  the company is involved in litigation which arises in the normal course of business 
in the opinion of management  the resolution of these lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of the company

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies include those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  refer to note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
consolidation of variable interest entity the company consolidates any variable interest entity vie of which we are the primary beneficiary 
the liabilities recognized as a result of consolidating a vie do not represent additional claims on our general assets  rather  they represent claims against the specific assets of the consolidated vie 
conversely  assets recognized as a result of consolidating a vie do not represent additional assets that could be used to satisfy claims against our general assets 
reflected in the june  balance sheet are consolidated vie assets of million  which is comprised mainly of land and building 
there were no vie assets at june  vie liabilities consist of a mortgage on that property in the amount of million 
this vie was initially consolidated by cody labs  as cody has been the primary beneficiary 
cody has then been consolidated within lannett s financial statements  due to the acquisition in april of cody labs by the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when its products are shipped 
at this point  an arrangement of sale exists by virtue of a customer purchase order 
delivery has transferred title and risk of loss to the customer 
the net sales price is determinable through a contracted sales price  less provisions for rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments that are reasonably determinable 
collectibility is reasonably assured 
accruals for these provisions are presented in the consolidated financial statements as rebates and chargebacks payable and reductions to net sales 
the change in the reserves for various sales adjustments may not be proportionally equal to the change in sales because of changes in both the product and the customer mix 
increased sales to wholesalers will generally require additional accruals as they are the primary recipient of chargebacks and rebates 
incentives offered to secure sales vary from product to product 
provisions for estimated rebates and promotional credits are estimated based upon contractual terms 
provisions for other customer credits  such as price adjustments  returns  and chargebacks  require management to make subjective judgments on customer mix 
unlike branded innovator drug companies  lannett does not use information about product levels in distribution channels from third party sources  such as ims and ndc health  in estimating future returns and other credits 
lannett calculates a chargeback rebate rate based on contractual terms with its customers and applies this rate to customer sales 
the only variable is customer mix  and this is based on historical data and sales expectations 
the chargeback rebate reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis by management using several ratio and calculated metrics 
lannett s methodology for estimating reserves has been consistent with previous periods 
chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue 
the company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors  generic distributors  retail pharmacy chains  and mail order pharmacies 
the company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies  managed care organizations  hospitals  nursing homes  and group purchasing organizations  collectively referred to as indirect customers 
lannett enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products 
the indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to actually purchase the products at these agreed upon prices 
lannett will provide credit to the wholesaler for the difference between the agreed upon price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler s invoice price if the price sold to the indirect customer is lower than the direct price to the wholesaler 
this credit is called a chargeback 
the provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell through levels by the company s wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels 
as sales to the large wholesale customers  such as cardinal health  amerisourcebergen  and mckesson  increase  the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase 
however  the size of the increase depends on the product mix 
the company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that actual chargebacks on actual shipments may differ from the actual chargeback reserves 
rebates rebates are offered to the company s key customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales 
these rebate programs provide customers with rebate credits upon attainment of pre established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period 
other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers 
at the time of shipment  the company estimates reserves for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement 
the reserve for rebates increases as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase 
however  since these rebate programs are not identical for all customers  the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of customers that eligible to receive rebates 
returns consistent with industry practice  the company has a product return policy that allows customers to return products within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product s lot expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases 
the company s policy requires that the customer obtain pre approval from the company for any qualifying return 
the company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience  changes to business practices  and credit terms 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimates in the past  historical returns may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors the provisions for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that product returns on actual sales may differ from established reserves 
generally  the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase 
the reserve for returns is included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
return periods will vary by customer and product 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a  reduction in sales to account for expected returns from a major wholesaler who was having difficulty selling a significant amount of levothyroxine sodium tablets that it had purchased a year earlier 
the company considered extending the shelf life of the product in march  but decided against this extension 
in may  the company decided to reserve for all estimated returns of this unsold product on hand at the wholesaler 
all unsold products remaining from may were potentially returnable by december  based on expiration dates 
the  reduction included the estimate of those expected returns through that date 
the product was returned to the company in december  and concurrently written off as slow moving and short dated inventory 
other adjustments other adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments  also known as shelf stock adjustments  which are credits issued to reflect decreases in the selling prices of the company s products that customers have remaining in their inventories at the time of a price reduction 
decreases in selling prices are discretionary decisions made by management to reflect competitive market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated shelf stock adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated declines in market prices  and estimates of inventory held by customers 
the company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available 
other adjustments are included in the rebates and chargebacks payable account on the balance sheet 
when competitors enter the market of existing products  shelf stock adjustments are issued to maintain price competitiveness 
management foresaw this occurrence and appropriately reserved for it as seen in the table below 
the following tables identify the reserves for each major category of revenue allowance and a summary of the activity for the years ended june   and for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves or reversals charged during fiscal related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves charged to net sales in fiscal related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales in fiscal reserve balance as of june  for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves or reversals charged during fiscal related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves charged to net sales in fiscal related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales in fiscal reserve balance as of june  for the year ended june  reserve category chargebacks rebates returns other total reserve balance as of june  actual credits issued related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves or reversals charged during fiscal related to sales recorded in prior fiscal years reserves charged to net sales in fiscal related to sales recorded in fiscal actual credits issued related to sales in fiscal reserve balance as of june  reserve activity vs 
the total reserves for chargebacks  rebates and returns decreased from  at june  to  at june  due to a decrease in sales to wholesale customers in the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to prior year 
historically  the ratio of the reserve to overall gross sales has been between and 
the fiscal years ended june  and were and  respectively 
this decrease in fiscal is due to the change in customer sales mix 
the following table shows the sales mix from fiscal and fiscal  and the fourth quarter of each year 
fiscal year ended fiscal fourth quarter chain drug stores mail order wholesalers private label sales to chain drug stores have increased significantly over the prior year 
the effect of those sales have been to increase overall sales while at the same time reduce the rate of chargebacks and rebates overall 
the fourth quarter of each year is significant to show  because the majority of the reserve remaining on the company s balance sheet at june of each year has arisen from sales made in the fourth quarter 
the decline in reserves is due to this decrease in sales to wholesalers 
fiscal year ended chargeback reserve rebate reserve return reserve other reserve the decrease in the chargeback reserve to  at june  from  at june  is due to the decrease in sales to wholesalers 
the decrease in rebate reserve to  from  at june  is also due to the decrease in sales to wholesalers plus the decrease in overall sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal there was a large rebate reserve as of june  as direct customers those who receive the only rebates were a larger than usual portion of sales in the month of june  typically 
during the year  the company began to implement systematic improvements to separately calculate the chargebacks and reserves 
management is continuing to make improvements to the calculation and reconciliation of these amounts 
management performs several types of analysis to ensure reserves are reasonable 
this includes ratio analysis of wholesaler versus direct or retail sales mix  revenue reserve to gross sales  comparison of net receivables to net sales  comparison of gross receivables to gross sales  and recalculation of wholesaler inventory levels 
through these steps  management is able to ensure that all reserves are reasonably stated 
because we are unable to independently verify product sales levels at the final customer  wholesaler inventory reports are used to recalculate potential chargebacks and rebates based on known contracted rebate and chargeback rates 
the return and other reserves have decreased since june   due to an unusually high level of shelf stock adjustments required in the prior year 
changes in the competition in the primidone market required lannett to give more of this type of credit in the prior year 
fluctuations in the amount of sales through the wholesaler channel will have an impact on the amount of reserve being charged 
due to the fact that wholesale sales result in greater chargebacks  a change in wholesale sales will directly correlate to change in the chargebacks required 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reserves recorded against sales amounted to million  million  million and million  respectively 
wholesaler sales were million  million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in the dollar value of the reserves corresponds to the increase in wholesale sales  most significantly in the fourth quarter 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reserves recorded against sales amounted to million  million  million and million  respectively 
wholesaler sales were million  million  million and million  respectively 
this third quarter increase in sales and reserves during fiscal is a result of increased demand for levothyroxine sodium  for which the reserve rebate and chargeback reserve remains consistent  but is higher than most other products 
this drug s reserves are higher than other drugs because of the number of competitors in the market 
this may change if the number of competitors decline because low prices will force some competitors out of the market  which in turn may lead to higher prices 
fourth quarter sales to wholesalers dropped off slightly from the third quarter 
the reserves in the fourth quarter also declined because of the product mix  but were consistent with reserves in the first and second quarters 
reserve activity vs 
the chargeback reserve increased from  at june  to  at june  due to an increased level of sales in the months of may and june as compared to prior year 
historically  the ratio of the reserve to gross sales is between and 
the fiscal years ended june  and were and  respectively 
in fiscal  there were additional reserves taken for an expected levothyroxine return 
this accounted for an additional million or 
additional rebate reserves of  related to fiscal were incurred during fiscal  and these were offset by reduced return reserves of the same amount 
this crossover of rebates and returns occurred because the company provided customer incentives to prevent any large returns 
rebates have decreased both in amount and as a percentage of the reserve in the additional credits issued related to sales recorded in fiscal due to the classification of rebates from wholesale customers 
when the reserve for chargebacks and rebates is calculated for the wholesale distribution customers  it is calculated in aggregate  that is  on a combined basis  since they submit the amounts together 
this is in part the reason why the chargeback amount has increased 
however there is a large rebate reserve as of june  as direct customers those who receive the only rebates were a larger than usual portion of sales in the month of june  typically 
other increased due to an increase in shelf stock adjustments 
additional competitors in the primidone market have caused lannett to give more of this type of credit 
currently  the company is in the process of developing systematic tracking of rebates and chargebacks to improve the accuracy of estimating chargebacks and rebates 
this will enable the company to separately analyze rebates and chargebacks  and will allow the company to more accurately estimate the required reserve on each category 
fluctuations in the amount of sales through the wholesaler channel will have an impact on the amount of reserve being charged 
due to the fact that wholesale sales result in greater chargebacks  an increase in wholesale sales will result in a higher level of chargebacks 
for the first  second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  reserves recorded against sales amounted to million  million  million and million  respectively 
wholesaler sales were million  million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in the dollar value of the reserves corresponds to the increase in wholesale sales  most significantly in the third quarter 
this third quarter increase in sales and reserves is a result of increased demand for levothyroxine sodium  for which the reserve rebate and chargeback reserve remains consistent  but is higher than most other products 
this drug s reserves are higher than other drugs because of the number of competitors in the market 
this may change if the number of competitors decline  because low prices will force some competitors out of the market  which in turn may lead to higher prices again 
fourth quarter sales to wholesalers dropped off slightly from the third quarter 
the reserves in the fourth quarter also declined because of the product mix  but were consistent with reserves in the first and second quarters 
management performs several types of analysis to ensure reserves are reasonable 
this includes ratio analysis of wholesaler versus direct or retail sales mix  revenue reserve to gross sales  comparison of net receivables to net sales  comparison of gross receivables to gross sales  and recalculation of wholesaler inventory levels

because we are unable to independently verify product sales levels at the final customer  wholesaler inventory reports are used to recalculate potential chargebacks and rebates based on known contracted rebate and chargeback rates 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within both the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
inventories the company values its inventory at the lower of cost determined by the first in  first out method or market  regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand  and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and production requirements 
the company s estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case it may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have recognized excess cost of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize such additional operating income at the time of sale 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded a  write down of slow moving and short dated inventory primarily related to levothyroxine sodium tablets  which had been returned by a wholesaler during the quarter 
during fiscal  approximately  of previously reserved inventory had been sold to customers  and the related reserve reduced by that amount 
intangible asset on march   the company entered into an agreement with jerome stevens pharmaceuticals  inc jsp for the exclusive marketing and distribution rights in the united states to the current line of jsp products in exchange for four million  shares of the company s common stock

effective january   fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company is currently evaluating the impact  that fin will have on its financial statements and will adopt this guidance beginning july  results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due in part from continued improvement in sales of levothyroxine sodium levo  which increased million  or over the prior year sales  and sulfamethoxazole with trimethoprim smz which increased million  a increase 
these increases were offset partially by decreases in other existing products  most significantly primidone tablets  of which sales declined  the company is working to offset continued declines in existing products through new product offerings 
currently  the company has over andas awaiting approval by the fda 
the increase in levo sales is due entirely to an increase in the quantity of bottles sold 
the increase in smz is due to quantity increases of nearly and price increases of 
overall  product sales quantities increased including new products  leading to increased sales 
greater pricing pressure  due to increased competition and new customer demands for lower prices offset the volume increase  resulting in the sales increase over fiscal smz pricing benefited from the departure of a competitor from the market 
such pricing changes due to competition are not predictable 
for that reason  the company must maintain its focus on developing new products every year to expand the number of product available to supply to customers 
net sales of new products are often impacted by greater incentives to wholesalers 
excluding sales of smz in fiscal  the company experienced a decline in new product net sales in the year 
this is due to the company receiving fewer approvals from the fda during the year 
at june   the company had products  as anda and anda supplements  awaiting approval from the fda 
this increased from as of june  the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below identifies the company s net sales to each category 
customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million million retail chain million million million mail order pharmacy million million million private label million million million total million million million wholesaler distributor sales increased due to a rebound in levothyroxine sodium sales and sales of new products 
levo and smz sales increased as wholesalers began to reorder the product in larger volumes in fiscal retail chain sales increased significantly due to a new significant customer agreement signed during fiscal mail order pharmacy sales decreased slightly from the prior year 
private label sales decreased due to our largest private label customer  qualitest  receiving fda approval in late november to manufacture its own primidone mg 
as disclosed previously  sales to the private label category have continued to decline  as lannett does not actively pursue additional private label customers because of the lower margins and product label inventories required to service the category 
cost of sales excluding amortization of intangible assets increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is due in part to higher production volumes to meet increased sales demand  and increased purchases of finished products for sale 
gross margins were in  a decline from in in spite of the significant increase in net sales  the company has increasing sales of drugs made by other companies  and distributed by lannett 
the margins on these drugs are typically lower than margins on produced drugs 
the company also launched a greater amount of new drugs in the prior year  and was able to take advantage of its new products and the higher margin on these products in depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
new drug approvals may increase in future years 
currently  there are products at the fda review stage 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development r d expenses decreased by  or 
the decrease in r d is primarily due to a decrease in raw material consumption for production of experimental batches 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or 
a significant portion of the increase is due to expenses incurred in fiscal that relate to marketing agreements tied to sales of new generic products 
the amortization expense relates to the march  exclusive marketing and distribution rights agreement with jsp 
for the remaining seven years of the contract  the company will incur annual amortization expense of approximately  on march   the company wrote down  of a note receivable owed by cody laboratories  inc the company determined that the value of the note receivable was impaired  and on april   it was decided to complete the acquisition of cody by forgiving a portion of the loan 
at that point  cody owed lannett approximately million  in the form of notes receivable and prepayments on products and services 
the remaining value of the amounts owed  or million was approximately the net asset value of cody at the time of the acquisition 
the note was determined to be uncollectible due to fda reviews and operational delays by cody to return to operation 
in  cody received an fda warning letter  and stopped operations to remediate their facility 
this remediation occurred from the months of august through february upon completion of the remediation  cody requested a future fda inspection 
the timing of that inspection was  at that time  unknown  and cody management was unable to conclude as to the outcome of that inspection 
with such a limited outlook  cody management suggested that the full note was not likely to be satisfied  and lannett management was not willing to loan further funds to cody to keep it in operation 
both companies agreed to complete the acquisition for the value of the cody s net assets 
the uncollected portion of debt was extinguished prior to the acquisition 
upon acquisition  the fair value of cody s assets was added to the company s consolidated balance sheets  and the results of operations were included in the consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date forward 
fair value was determined using an independent valuation firm 
due to the fact that most of the value of cody consisted of physical assets that were recently acquired as part of the remediation  the fair value closely approximated the book value of net assets 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board statement no 
 business combinations  measurement is based on the fair value of the consideration given or the fair value of the asset or net assets acquired  whichever is more clearly evident and  thus  more reliably measurable 
the company s net loss for fiscal includes an income tax expense of  as compared to an expense of  in fiscal the company has set up a valuation allowance on the tax benefit from the write off of a portion of the cody loan described above in fiscal this has led to an income tax expense despite of the net loss from operations 
the company reported net loss of  for fiscal  or 
basic and diluted loss per share  compared to net income of  for fiscal  or 
basic and diluted earnings per share 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales increased by  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase was due in part to a rebound in levothyroxine sales which increased million  or 
the company also had additional growth with the introduction of several new products which accounted for million in sales 
several other products besides levothyroxine sodium experienced increased sales over prior year including digoxin  acetazolamide  unithroid  and hydromorphone 
volume and price increases attributed to increased sales due to increase in volume new sales are included in volume increases and increase in prices 
prices rebounded in the sales of levothyroxine and digoxin 
both saw increased price pressure in the prior year as several competitors entered into the market 
in addition  net sales of new products are often impacted by greater incentives to wholesalers 
new product net sales of million in fiscal are net of reserves of million 
this is a significant increase over fiscal net sales of  and reserves of  that were associated with new product net sales 
the company sells its products to customers in various categories 
the table below identifies the company s net sales to each category 
customer category fiscal net sales fiscal net sales fiscal net sales wholesaler distributor million million million retail chain million million million mail order pharmacy million million million private label million million million total million million million wholesaler distributor sales increased due to a rebound in levothyroxine sodium sales and sales of new products 
levothyroxine sodium sales increased as wholesalers reduced their inventories and began to reorder the product in larger volumes in fiscal mail order pharmacy sales increased due to new product sales and the fact that this area of the industry is growing at a faster rate than the other areas 
retail chain sales remained unchanged from the prior year  as new products sales replaced the loss of any existing products 
private label sales decreased due to our largest private label customer  qualitest  receiving fda approval in late november to manufacture its own primidone mg 
sales to the private label category may continue to decline  as lannett does not actively pursue additional private label customers because of the lower margins and product label inventories required to service the category 
cost of sales excluding amortization of intangible assets increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase is due in part to higher production volumes to meet increased sales demand 
gross margins were in  an improvement over in improvement was  in part  affected by the prior year write off of short dated levothyroxine sodium 
the prior year also experienced an increased return accrual  taken in anticipation of an unusually large return of levothyroxine 
the levothyroxine related write offs accounted for of cost of sales in the prior year 
aside from the prior year one time incidents related to levothyroxine  the margins increased due to additional product offerings and higher effective pricing 
despite new entrants to the primidone market  the company was able to maintain its market share and competitive price 
the company was also able to take advantage of its new products and the higher margin on these products 
depending on future market conditions for each of the company s products  changes in the future sales product mix may occur 
these changes may affect the gross profit percentage in future periods 
research and development r d expenses increased by  or 
the increase in r d is primarily due to an increase in raw material consumption for production of experimental batches 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or 
the increase is primarily due to the adoption of sfas r which contributed stock compensation expense of million 
amortization expense decreased million from million to million due to the write down of the intangible asset that occurred in march please see further description of this event in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  under the heading intangible assets 
as a result of the revaluation of the intangible asset  the company s financial results changed from an operating loss of  in fiscal to an operating income of  in fiscal the company s income tax classification changed to an income tax expense of  from an income tax benefit of  in fiscal the effective tax rate increased slightly from in to in the company reported net income of  for fiscal  or 
basic and diluted income per share  compared to net loss of  for fiscal  or basic and diluted loss per share 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended june  was attributable to a net loss of  as adjusted for the effects of non cash items of  of which  was an impairment charge related to the acquisition of cody laboratories  inc  and net changes in operating assets and liabilities totaling  significant changes in operating assets and liabilities are described below 
an increase in inventory of  due to an increase in the amount of distributed product inventory on hand 
distributed products in general saw a significant increase in sales during fiscal  resulting in increased purchasing of those products by the company in order to maintain stock available for resale 
an increase in trade accounts receivable of  was due to changes in the sales mix at the end of  compared to the end of the company sold significantly more product to retail customers during  and less as a percentage to wholesale customers 
as a result  the reserve for chargebacks and rebates  which are generally higher for wholesale customers  decreased during the year more than gross trade accounts receivable  resulting in higher net trade accounts receivable 
an increase in accounts payable of  resulted from favorable increases in payment terms negotiated during the year as well as differences in the timing of payments at year end and an increase in accrued expenses of  was due to a receiving accrual for materials received at the end of the fiscal year related primarily to distributed products received  as well as an increase in deferred revenue related to certain inventory for which payment has been received  but which has not been shipped 
this was partially offset by decreased personnel expenses 
these fluctuations are in the normal course of business 
an increase in deferred revenue of  was due to payments received in advance of shipment of products 
the company will recognize revenue upon shipment of the drugs or upon passage of their expiration date 
the company monitors both net dso and gross dso as an overall check on collections and reasonableness of reserves 
in order to be effective indicators  both dso measures are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
the gross dso calculation provides management with an understanding of the frequency of customer payments  and the ability to process customer payments and deductions 
the net dso calculation provides management with an understanding of the relationship of the a r balance net of the reserve liability compared to net sales after reserves charged during the period 
standard payment terms offered to customers are consistent with industry practice at days 
the following table shows the results of these calculations for the relevant periods fiscal year ended june  net dso in days gross dso in days the increase in net dso is due to reduced reserves that offset receivables 
this is a result of the increased sales to chain drug stores  a result of new customers  and decreased sales to wholesale customers 
issues in the prior year related to customers reporting of credits had been resolved  lending to an improvement in the gross dso calculation 
in addition  the company improved in the timeliness of processing credits 
the company anticipates that gross dso will be in the to day range in future reports  as the payment terms for most customers are days 
the net dso calculation provides us with an understanding of the relationship of the a r balance net of the reserve liability compared to net sales after reserves charged during the period 
it eliminates the effect of timing of processing  which is inherent in the gross dso calculation 
a net calculation greater than days may indicate under reserved sales  while an amount less than days may indicate over reserved sales  among other causes 
this figure is expected to approximate days 
the fact that the amount is less than days at june  and is primarily the result of wholesalers sell through of our products being extended past the expected to week timeframe 
the increase to days at june  indicates that this sell through issue no longer exists 
the net cash used in investing activities of  for the twelve months ended june  was mostly due to the purchase of property  plant and equipment of  as well as a  loan

prospects for the future the company has several generic products under development 
these products are all orally administered  topical and parenteral products designed to be generic equivalents to brand named innovator drugs 
the company s developmental drug products are intended to treat a diverse range of indications 
as the oldest generic drug manufacturer in the country  formed in  lannett currently owns several andas for products which it does not manufacture and market 
these andas are simply dormant on the company s records 
occasionally  the company reviews such andas to determine if the market potential for any of these older drugs has recently changed  so as to make it attractive for lannett to reconsider manufacturing and selling it 
if the company makes the determination to introduce one of these products into the consumer marketplace  it must review the anda and related documentation to ensure that the approved product specifications  formulation and other factors meet current fda requirements for the marketing of that drug 
the company would then redevelop the product and submit it to the fda for supplemental approval 
the fda s approval process for anda supplements is similar to that of a new anda 
generally  in these situations  the company must file a supplement to the fda for the applicable anda  informing the fda of any significant changes in the manufacturing process  the formulation  or the raw material supplier of the previously approved anda 
a majority of the products in development represent either previously approved andas that the company is planning to reintroduce anda supplements  or new formulations new andas 
the products under development are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  scale up  and or clinical testing 
depending on the complexity of the active ingredient s chemical characteristics  the cost of the raw material  the fda mandated requirement of bioequivalence studies  the cost of such studies and other developmental factors  the cost to develop a new generic product varies 
it can range from  to million 
some of lannett s developmental products will require bioequivalence studies  while others will not depending on the fda s orange book classification 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping additional products 
in addition to the efforts of its internal product development group  lannett has contracted with several outside firms for the formulation and development of several new generic drug products 
these outsourced r d products are at various stages in the development cycle formulation  analytical method development and testing and manufacturing scale up 
these products are orally administered solid dosage products intended to treat a diverse range of medical indications 
it is the company s intention to ultimately transfer the formulation technology and manufacturing process for all of these r d products to the company s own commercial manufacturing sites 
the company initiated these outsourced r d efforts to complement the progress of its own internal r d efforts 
occasionally the company will work on developing a drug product that does not require fda approval 
the fda allows generic manufacturers to manufacture and sell products which are chemically equivalent to innovator drugs which are grand fathered  under fda rules  prior to the passage of the hatch waxman act of the fda allows generic manufacturers to produce and sell generic versions of such grand fathered products by simply performing and internally documenting the product s stability over a period of time 
under this scenario  a generic company can forego the time required for fda anda approval 
the company signed supply and development agreements with olive healthcare  of india  orion pharma  of finland  azad pharma ag  of switzerland  unichem inc of india  wintac limited of india  pharmaseed of israel and banner pharmacaps of the united states  and is in negotiations with companies in israel and china for similar new product initiatives  in which lannett will market and distribute products manufactured by lannett or by third parties 
lannett intends to use its strong customer relationships to build its market share for such products  and increase future revenues and income 
the majority of the company s r d projects are being developed in house under lannett s direct supervision and with company personnel 
hence  the company does not believe that its outside contracts for product development and manufacturing supply are material in nature  nor is the company substantially dependent on the services rendered by such outside firms 
since the company has no control over the fda review process  management is unable to anticipate whether or when it will be able to begin producing and shipping such additional products 
lannett may increase its focus on certain specialty markets in the generic pharmaceutical industry 
such a focus is intended to provide lannett customers with increased product alternatives in categories with relatively few market participants 
while there is no guarantee that lannett has the market expertise or financial resources necessary to succeed in such a market specialty  management is confident that such future focus will be well received by lannett customers and increase shareholder value in the long run 
the company plans to enhance relationships with strategic business partners  including providers of product development research  raw materials  active pharmaceutical ingredients as well as finished goods 
management believes that mutually beneficial strategic relationships in such areas  including potential financing arrangements  partnerships  joint ventures or acquisitions  could allow for potential competitive advantages in the generic pharmaceutical market 
the company plans to continue to explore such areas for potential opportunities to enhance shareholder value
