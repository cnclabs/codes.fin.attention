item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 
cpsa monitors our service encounter value based upon data submitted by us electronically 
if our service encounter value exceeds amounts paid to us under this contract equal to one twelfth of the annual contract amount on a monthly basis  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
for the contract year ended june  and for the first six months of the contract year ending june   the amount of revenue we recognized in excess of amounts paid to us as of december  amounted to approximately million 
of this amount we collected  as of december  
table of contents in accordance with our accounting policy related to allowance for doubtful accounts  which is set forth in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates in this report  we reserved of the remaining amounts accrued in excess of the annual funding allocation amount for the contract year ended june   or approximately million  in if our encounter value is not sufficient to support year to date payments made to us or if we fail to provide data sufficient to permit accurate monitoring of our service encounter value  cpsa can suspend payments to us 
cpsa has not suspended payments to us nor have we returned any amounts to the payer 
while we do not anticipate that we will be required to return any amounts to cpsa  and while we believe that our service encounter value is sufficient to support all amounts paid to us under the contract  there can be no assurances that this will be the case 
if we fail to estimate accurately the cost of performing certain contracts  we may incur losses on these contracts 
under our fee for service contracts  we receive fees based on our interactions with government sponsored clients 
to earn a profit on these contracts  we must accurately estimate costs incurred in providing services 
our risk on these contracts is that our client population is not large enough to cover our fixed costs  such as rent and other overhead 
our fee for service contracts are not reimbursed on a cost basis and therefore  if we fail to estimate our costs accurately  we may incur losses on these contracts 
approximately of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from cost based service contracts in california for which we record revenue at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies  which puts us at risk that we may be required to subsequently refund a portion of our recorded revenues for such contracts 
our cost based service contracts require us to allow for contingencies such as budgeted costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or an insufficient number of encounters 
for the year ended december   revenues from these contracts represented approximately of our total revenues for the period 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under the contracts  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our results of operations will fluctuate due to seasonality 
our quarterly operating results and operating cash flows normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business  principally due to lower client demand for our home and community based services during the holiday and summer seasons 
historically  these seasonal variations have had a nominal affect on our operating results and operating cash flows 
as we have grown our home and community based services business  our exposure to seasonal variations has grown and will continue to grow  particularly with respect to our school based services  educational services and tutoring services 
we experience lower home and community based services revenue when school is not in session 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our home and community based services 
moreover  as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response to our entry by other social services providers 
as a result of these factors  quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indicator of our future performance 
further  it is possible that in any future quarter our operating results could be below the expectations of investors and any published reports or analyses regarding our company 
in that event  the price of our common stock could decline substantially 

table of contents while we obtain some of our business through responses to government requests for proposals  we may not be awarded contracts through this process in the future  and contracts we are awarded may not be profitable 
we obtain  and will continue to seek to obtain  a significant portion of our business from state or local government entities 
to obtain business from government entities  we are often required to respond to requests for proposals  or rfps 
to propose effectively  we must accurately estimate our cost structure for servicing a proposed contract  the time required to establish operations and the terms of the proposals submitted by competitors 
we must also assemble and submit a large volume of information within rigid and often short timetables 
our ability to respond successfully to rfps will greatly impact our business 
we may not be awarded contracts through the rfp process  and our proposals may not result in profitable contracts 
if we fail to establish and maintain important relationships with officials of government entities and agencies  we may not be able to successfully procure or retain government sponsored contracts  which could negatively impact our revenues 
to facilitate our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts  we rely in part on establishing and maintaining relationships with officials of various government entities and agencies 
these relationships enable us to provide informal input and advice to the government entities and agencies prior to the development of an rfp or program for privatization of social services and enhance our chances of procuring contracts with these payers 
the effectiveness of our relationships may be reduced or eliminated with changes in the personnel holding various government offices or staff positions 
we also may lose key personnel who have these relationships 
we may be unable to successfully manage our relationships with government entities and agencies and with elected officials and appointees 
any failure to establish  maintain or manage relationships with government and agency personnel may hinder our ability to procure or retain government sponsored contracts 
the federal government may refuse to grant consents and or waivers necessary to permit for profit entities to perform certain elements of government programs 
under current law  in order to privatize certain functions of government programs  the federal government must grant a consent and or waiver to the petitioning state or local agency 
if the federal government does not grant a necessary consent or waiver or withdraw approval of any granted waiver  the state or local agency will be unable to contract with a for profit entity  such as us  to provide the service 
failure by state or local agencies to obtain consents and or waivers could adversely affect our continued business and future growth 
our business could be adversely affected by future legislative changes that hinder or reverse the privatization of social services 
the market for our services depends largely on federal  state and local legislative programs 
these programs can be modified or amended at any time 
moreover  part of our growth strategy includes aggressively pursuing opportunities created by the federal  state and local initiatives to privatize the delivery of social services 
however  there are opponents to the privatization of social services and  as a result  future privatization of social services is uncertain 
if additional privatization initiatives are not proposed or enacted  or if previously enacted privatization initiatives are challenged  repealed or invalidated  our growth could be adversely impacted 
our strategic relationships with certain not for profit and tax exempt entities are subject to tax and other risks 
since some government agencies in certain of our markets prefer or require contracts for privatized social services to be administered through not for profit organizations  we rely on our long term relationships with not for profit organizations to provide services to these government agencies 
we currently maintain strategic relationships with not for profit social services organizations with which we have management contracts of varying lengths  of which are federally tax exempt organizations 

table of contents our strategic relationships with tax exempt not for profit organizations are similar to those in the hospital management industry where tax exempt or faith based not for profit hospitals are managed by for profit companies 
federal tax laws require that the boards of directors of not for profit tax exempt organizations be independent 
the boards of directors of the tax exempt not for profit organizations for which we provide management services have a majority of independent members 
the board members are predominately selected from independent members of the local community in which the not for profit entity operates 
decisions regarding our business relationships with these not for profit entities are made by their independent board members including approving the management fees we charge to manage their organizations and any discretionary bonuses 
federal tax laws also require that the management fees we charge the not for profit entities we manage be fixed and at fair market rates 
typically  a fairness opinion is obtained by the not for profit entities we manage from an independent third party valuation consultant that substantiates the fair market rates 
if the internal revenue service determined that any tax exempt organization was paying more than market rates for services performed by us  the managed entity could lose its tax exempt status and owe back taxes and penalties 
generally  under state law  not for profit entities may pay no more than reasonable compensation for services rendered 
if the compensation paid to us by these not for profit entities is deemed unreasonable  then the state could take action against the not for profit entity which could adversely affect us 
government unions may oppose privatizing government programs to outside vendors such as us  which could limit our market opportunities 
our success depends in part on our ability to win contracts to administer and manage programs traditionally administered by government employees 
many government employees  however  belong to labor unions with considerable financial resources and lobbying networks 
these unions could apply political pressure on legislators and other officials seeking to privatize government programs 
union opposition could result in our losing government contracts or being precluded from providing services under government contracts 
inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage could damage our reputation and harm our ability to procure government sponsored contracts 
the media sometimes provides news coverage about our contracts and the services we provide to clients 
this media coverage  if negative  could influence government officials to slow the pace of privatizing government services 
moreover  inaccurate  misleading or negative media coverage about us could harm our reputation and  accordingly  our ability to obtain government sponsored contracts 
we may incur costs before receiving related revenues  which could result in cash shortfalls 
when we are awarded a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses before we receive any contract payments 
these expenses include leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel 
as a result  in certain large contracts where the government does not fund program start up costs  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving related contract payments 
in addition  payments due to us from payers may be delayed due to billing cycles or as a result of failures to approve government budgets in a timely manner 
moreover  any resulting cash shortfall could be exacerbated if we fail to either invoice the payer or to collect our fee in a timely manner 

table of contents our business is subject to risks of litigation 
we are in the human services business and therefore are subject to claims alleging we did not properly treat an individual or failed to properly diagnose and or care for a client 
we carry professional liability and general liability insurance and have an umbrella liability insurance policy  which provide us with aggregate coverage limits of million per occurrence and an annual combined policy aggregate limit of million 
a substantial award could have a material adverse impact on our operations and cash flow and could adversely impact our ability to continue to purchase appropriate liability insurance 
we can be subject to claims for negligence or intentional misconduct in addition to professional liability type claims by an employee  including but not limited to  claims arising out of accidents involving employees driving to or from interactions with clients or assault and battery 
we can be subject to employee related claims such as wrongful discharge or discrimination or a violation of equal employment law 
while we are insured for these types of claims  damages exceeding our insurance limits or outside our insurance coverage  such as a claim for fraud  could adversely affect our cash flow and financial condition 
furthermore  we can be subject to miscellaneous errors and omissions liability relative to the various management agreements we have with the not for profit entities we manage 
in the event of a claim and depending on  among other things  the circumstances  allegations  and size of the management contract  we could be subject to damages that could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our use of a self insurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business upon the occurrence of an uninsured event 
we are self insured with regard to a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities managed by us under reinsurance programs through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary 
in the event that our actual reinsured losses and the reinsured losses of the certain designated entities managed by us increase unexpectedly or exceed our estimated reinsured losses under the program  the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  as the availability to us of certain traditional insurance coverage diminishes or increases in costs  we will continue to evaluate the levels of claims we include in our self insurance program 
any increases to this program increase our risk exposure and therefore increase the risk of a possible material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
we could be subject to significant state regulation and potential sanctions if our health care benefits program is deemed to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement 
for the purpose of managing and providing employee healthcare benefits we deem ourselves to be a single employer under section of erisa with regard to our own employees as well as the employees of certain of our managed entities covered by our healthcare benefit program to whom we offered healthcare benefits through june the department of labor or individual states could disagree with our interpretation and consider our program to be a multiple employer welfare arrangement  or mewa  and  as such  subject to regulation by state insurance commissions 
if involuntarily deemed a mewa  our cost to manage the state by state regulatory environment for the self funded portion of our health insurance program would be prohibitive and we could  as a result  elect to maintain our self funded health insurance plan only for our owned entities  forcing the three managed entities currently included in our self funded plan to negotiate and purchase their own health benefits 
in addition  if our health care benefits program is determined to be a mewa  civil and or criminal sanctions are possible 
we face substantial competition in attracting and retaining experienced social service professionals  and we may be unable to grow our business if we cannot attract and retain qualified employees 
our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and experienced social service professionals who possess the skills and experience necessary to deliver high quality 
table of contents services to our clients 
our objective of providing the highest quality of service to our clients is strongly considered when we evaluate education  experience and qualifications of potential candidates for employment as direct care and administrative staff 
to that end  we attempt to hire professionals who have attained a bachelors degree  masters degree or higher level of education and certification or licensure as direct care social service providers and administrators 
these employees are in great demand and are likely to remain a limited resource for the foreseeable future 
we must quickly hire project leaders and case management personnel after a contract is awarded to us 
contract provisions and client needs determine the number  education and experience levels of social service professionals we hire 
we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract 
our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite experience and skills depends on several factors including  but not limited to  our ability to offer competitive wages  benefits and professional growth opportunities 
some of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do 
the inability to attract and retain experienced personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our success depends on our ability to manage growing and changing operations 
since  our business has grown significantly in size and complexity 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on our management  systems  internal controls and financial and physical resources 
in addition  we expect that we will need to further develop our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems to accommodate future growth 
this could require us to incur expenses for hiring additional qualified personnel  retaining professionals to assist in developing the appropriate control systems and expanding our information technology infrastructure 
the nature of our business is such that qualified management personnel can be difficult to find 
our inability to manage growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
any acquisition that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we anticipate that we will continue making strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we have made a number of acquisitions since our inception  including fifteen since our initial public offering in august the success of these and other acquisitions depends in part on our ability to integrate acquired companies into our business operations 
there can be no assurance that the companies acquired will continue to generate income at the same historical levels on which we based our acquisition decisions  that we will be able to maintain or renew the acquired companies contracts  that we will be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration of acquired companies or that the acquisitions will not adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we continually review opportunities to acquire other businesses that would complement our current services  expand our markets or otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with some acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute existing stockholders percentage ownership and or we could incur or assume substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to  the following problems assimilating the purchased operations  unanticipated costs and legal or financial liabilities associated with an acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our core businesses  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  entering markets in which we have limited or no experience  potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations  
table of contents the incurrence of excessive leverage in financing an acquisition  failure to maintain and renew contracts  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with an acquisition  and dilution to our earnings per share 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming problems encountered in connection with any acquisition  and our inability to do so could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business 
our future debt obligations could impair our liquidity and financial condition 
we may incur debt in the future in connection with our acquisition strategy and for other corporate opportunities 
if we do so  these debt obligations could pose risk by making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our debt obligations  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other corporate requirements  impeding us from obtaining additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes  and making us more vulnerable if a downturn in our business occurs and limiting our flexibility to plan for  or react to  changes in our business 
if we were to fail to make any required payment under the agreements governing our indebtedness or fail to comply with the financial and operating covenants contained in these agreements  we would be in default 
a default could have a significant adverse effect on the market value and marketability of our common stock 
our lenders would have the ability to require that we immediately pay all outstanding indebtedness 
if the lenders were to require immediate payment  we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under our credit facility  our subordinated notes or our other indebtedness 
in such event  we could be forced to seek protection under bankruptcy laws  which could have a material adverse effect on our existing contracts and our ability to procure new contracts as well as our ability to recruit and or retain employees 
our success depends on our ability to compete effectively in the marketplace 
we compete for clients and for contracts with a variety of organizations that offer similar services 
most of our competition consists of local social service organizations that compete with us for local contracts  such as united way supported agencies and faith based agencies such as catholic social services  jewish family and children s services and the salvation army 
other competitors include local  not for profit organizations and community based organizations 
historically  these types of organizations have been favored in our industry as incumbent providers of services to government entities 
we also compete with larger companies  such as res care  inc  which provides support services  training and educational programs predominantly to medicaid eligible beneficiaries 
national mentor  inc is the country s largest provider of foster care services and competes with us in existing markets for foster care services 
in addition  many institutional providers offer some type of community based care including such organizations as cornell companies  inc  psychiatric solutions  inc and the devereaux foundation 
some of these companies have greater financial  technical  political  marketing  name recognition and other resources and a larger number of clients and or payers than we do 
in addition  some of these companies offer more services than we do 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  competition from new entrants into our markets 
increased competition may result in pricing pressures  loss of or failure to gain market share or loss of clients or payers  any of which could harm our business 

table of contents our business is subject to state licensing regulations and other regulatory provisions  including regulatory provisions governing surveys  audits  anti kickbacks  self referrals  false claims and the health insurance portability and accountability act of  and changes to or violations of these regulations could negatively impact our revenues 
in many of the locations where we operate  we are required by state law to obtain and maintain licenses 
the applicable state and local licensing requirements govern the services we provide  the credentials of staff  record keeping  treatment planning  client monitoring and supervision of staff 
the failure to maintain these licenses or the loss of a license could have a material adverse impact on our business and could prevent us from providing services to clients in a given jurisdiction 
most of our contracts are subject to surveys or audit by our payers 
we are also subject to regulations that restrict our ability to contract directly with a government agency in certain situations 
such restrictions could affect our ability to contract with certain payers 
in addition  we are or may be subject to anti kickback  self referral and false claim laws 
violations of these laws may result in significant penalties  including repayment of any amounts alleged to be overpayments or in violation of such laws  criminal fines  civil money penalties  damages  imprisonment  a ban from participation in federally funded healthcare programs and or bans from obtaining government contracts 
such fines and other penalties could negatively impact our business by decreasing profits due to repayment of overpayments or from the imposition of fines and damages  damaging our reputation and diverting our management resources 
due to our access  use or disclosure of health information relating to individuals  we are subject to the privacy mandates of hipaa 
hipaa mandates  among other things  the adoption of standards to enhance the efficiency and simplify the administration of the nation s healthcare system 
hipaa requires the dhhs to adopt standards for electronic transactions and code sets for basic healthcare transactions such as payment  eligibility and remittance advices  or transaction standards  privacy of individually identifiable health information  or privacy standards  security of individually identifiable health information  or security standards  electronic signatures  as well as unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals and enforcement 
final regulations have been issued by dhhs for the privacy standards  certain of the transaction standards and security standards 
as a healthcare provider  we are required to comply in our operations with these standards and are subject to significant civil and criminal penalties for failure to do so 
in addition  in connection with providing services to customers that also are healthcare providers  we are required to provide satisfactory written assurances to those customers that we will provide those services in accordance with the privacy standards and security standards 
hipaa has and will require significant and costly changes for our company and others in the healthcare industry 
compliance with the privacy standards became mandatory in april  compliance with the transaction standards became mandatory in october although full implementation was delayed with respect to the medicare program until october  and compliance with the security standards became mandatory in april in february  dhhs published its final rule on enforcement of the hipaa administrative simplification provisions  including the transaction standards  the security standards and the privacy rule 
this enforcement rule addresses  among other issues  dhhs s policies for determining violations and calculating civil money penalties  how dhhs will address the statutory limitations on the imposition of civil monetary penalties  and various procedural issues 
we have appointed an internal committee to maintain our privacy and security policies regarding client information in compliance with hipaa 
this committee is responsible for training our employees  including our regional and local managers and staff  to comply with hipaa and monitoring compliance with the policy 
however  like other businesses subject to hipaa regulations  we cannot fully predict the total financial or other impact of these regulations on us 
the costs associated with our ongoing compliance could be substantial  which could negatively impact our profitability 

table of contents provisions in our corporate documents and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as delaware general corporation law  may hinder a change of control 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of the delaware general corporation law  could discourage unsolicited proposals to acquire us  even though such proposals may be beneficial to you 
these provisions include a classified board of directors that cannot be replaced without cause by a majority vote of our stockholders  our board of director s authorization to issue shares of preferred stock  on terms as the board of directors may determine  without stockholder approval  and provisions of delaware general corporation law that restrict many business combinations 
we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could prevent us from engaging in a business combination with a or greater stockholder for a period of three years from the date it acquired such status unless appropriate board or stockholder approvals are obtained

in connection with the performance of our contracts and the contracts of our managed entities  we lease offices and our managed entities lease offices for management and administrative functions 
the lease terms vary and are generally at market rates 
we acquired a  square foot office building in pottsville  pennsylvania in connection with the acquisition of providence community services  inc formerly known as pottsville behavioral counseling group  inc  which is free of any mortgage 
we believe that our properties are adequate for our current business needs 
further  we believe that we can obtain adequate space to meet our foreseeable business needs 
item legal proceedings although we believe we are not currently a party to any material litigation  we may from time to time become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from our ordinary course of business 
these claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources

overview of our business we provide government sponsored social services directly and through not for profit social services organizations whose operations we manage 
as a result of  and in response to  the large and growing population of eligible beneficiaries of government sponsored social services  increasing pressure on governments to control costs and increasing acceptance of privatized social services  we have grown both organically by increasing our capacity to provide services in previously underserved geographic areas through the development of new programs and by consummating strategic acquisitions to enter new states and to gain expertise in new service areas 
for example  our acquisition in california has provided a local base from which to bid on contracts under the state s mental health services act  intended to transform their public mental health system 
as of december   we have won four of six awards in orange county  one contract in san diego county and still have additional bid activity pending in san diego and los angeles counties 
other states that are increasing their privatization efforts include north carolina  where our wholly owned subsidiary  family preservation services of north carolina  inc  was awarded approximately  clients under the state s accelerating privatization initiatives for its mental health  developmental disabilities and substance abuse services  new jersey  where we recently won a contract to provide foster care services  and pennsylvania and arizona  where we continue to gain clients 
as part of our growth strategy we have entered into the in home tutoring  workforce development and private probation services markets and expanded our presence in existing markets through several acquisitions which were completed in discussed below 
as of december   we provided services directly and through the entities we manage to over  clients from locations in states and the district of 
table of contents columbia 
our goal is to be the provider of choice to the social services industry 
focusing on our core competencies in the delivery of home and community based counseling  foster care and not for profit managed services  we believe we are well positioned to offer the highest quality of service to our clients and provide a viable alternative to state and local governments current service delivery systems 
our industry is highly fragmented  competitive and dependent upon government funding 
we depend on our experience  financial strength and broad presence to compete vigorously in each service offering 
challenges for us include competing with local incumbent social services providers in some of the areas we seek to enter and  in rural areas where significant growth opportunities exist  finding and retaining qualified employees 
we seek strategic acquisitions as one way to enter competitive markets 
our business is highly dependent upon our obtaining contracts with government sponsored entities 
when we are awarded or assigned a contract to provide services  we may incur expenses such as leasing office space  purchasing office equipment and hiring personnel before we receive any contract payments 
with respect to some of the large contracts we are awarded  we may be required to invest significant sums of money before receiving any contract payments 
we are also required to recruit and hire qualified staff to perform the services under contract 
we strive to control these start up costs by leveraging our existing infrastructure to maximize our resources and manage our growth effectively 
however  with each contract we are awarded  we face the challenge of quickly and effectively building a client base to generate revenue to recover these costs 
on april   we completed an underwritten follow on offering of our common stock 
additional information regarding the underwritten follow on offering of our common stock is included in the liquidity and capital resources discussion below 
we renegotiated certain terms of our reinsurance policy with respect to our general and professional liability reinsurance program effective may  additional information regarding our reinsurance programs is included in the liquidity and capital resources discussion below 
our working capital requirements are primarily funded by cash from operations and borrowings from our credit facility with cit healthcare llc  or cit  which provides funding for general corporate purposes and acquisitions 
how we earn our revenue our revenue is derived from our provider contracts with state and local government agencies and government intermediaries and from our management contracts with not for profit social services organizations 
the government entities that pay for our services include welfare  child welfare and justice departments  public schools and state medicaid programs 
under a majority of the contracts where we provide services directly  we are paid an hourly fee 
in other such situations  we receive a set monthly amount or we are paid amounts equal to the costs we incur to provide agreed upon services 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as either revenue from home and community based services or foster care services 
where we contract to manage the operations of not for profit social services organizations  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenue of the managed entity or a predetermined fee 
these revenues are presented in our consolidated statements of operations as management fees 
because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and our management fees are largely dependent upon their revenues  we also monitor for management and disclosure purposes the revenues of our managed entities 
we refer to the revenues of these entities as managed entity revenue 
in addition  from time to time  we provide short term consulting services to other social services organizations for which we receive consulting fees that are a fixed amount per contract 
any such consulting revenues are presented in our consolidated statement of operations as management fees 

table of contents how we grow our business and evaluate our performance our business grows internally  through organic expansion into new markets  increases in the number of clients served under contracts we or our managed entities are awarded  and externally through acquisitions 
we typically pursue organic expansion into markets that are contiguous to our existing markets or where we believe we can quickly establish a significant presence 
when we expand organically into a market  we typically have no clients or perform no management services in the market and are required to incur start up costs including the costs of space  required permits and initial personnel 
these costs are expensed as incurred and our new offices can be expected to incur losses for a period of time until we adequately grow our revenue from clients or management fees 
we also pursue strategic acquisitions in markets where we see opportunities but where we lack the contacts and or personnel to make a successful organic entry 
unlike organic expansion which involves start up costs that may dilute earnings  expansion through acquisitions is generally accretive to our earnings 
however  we bear financing risk and where debt is used  the risk of leverage by expanding through acquisitions 
we also must integrate the acquired business into our operations which could disrupt our business and we may not be able to realize operating and economic efficiencies upon integration 
finally  our acquisitions involve purchase prices in excess of the fair value of tangible assets and cash or receivables 
this excess purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and is subject to periodic evaluation and impairment or other write downs that are charges against our earnings 
in all our markets we focus on several key performance indicators in managing our business 
specifically  we focus on growth in the number of clients served  as that particular metric is the key driver of our revenue growth 
we also focus on the number of employees as that is our most important variable cost and the key to the management of our operating margins

there are no assurances  however  that we will complete acquisitions in the future or that any completed acquisitions will prove profitable for us 
critical accounting policies and estimates general in preparing our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents critical accounting policies are those policies most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
these policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets  our management agreement relationships  loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue at the time services are rendered at predetermined amounts stated in our contracts and when the collection of these amounts is considered to be reasonably assured 
at times we may receive funding for certain services in advance of services actually being rendered 
these amounts are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as deferred revenue until the actual services are rendered 
as services are rendered  documentation is prepared describing each service  time spent  and billing code under each contract to determine and support the value of each service provided 
this documentation is used as a basis for billing under our contracts 
the billing process and documentation submitted under our contracts vary among our payers 
the timing  amount and collection of our revenues under these contracts are dependent upon our ability to comply with the various billing requirements specified by each payer 
failure to comply with these requirements could delay the collection of amounts due to us under a contract or result in adjustments to amounts billed 
the performance of our contracts is subject to the condition that sufficient funds are appropriated  authorized and allocated by each state  city or other local government 
if sufficient appropriations  authorizations and allocations are not provided by the respective state  city or other local government  we are at risk of immediate termination or renegotiation of the financial terms of our contracts 
fee for service contracts 
revenues related to services provided under fee for service contracts are recognized as revenue at the time services are rendered and collection is determined to be probable 
such services are provided at established billing rates 
fee for service contracts represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and cost based service contracts 
revenues from our cost based service contracts in california are recorded at one twelfth of the annual contract amount less allowances for certain contingencies such as projected costs not incurred  excess cost per service over the allowable contract rate and or insufficient encounters 
this policy results in recognizing revenue from these contracts based on allowable costs incurred 
the annual contract amount is based on projected costs to provide services under the contracts with adjustments for changes in the total contract amount 
we annually submit projected costs for the coming year which assist the contracting payers in establishing the annual contract amount to be paid for services provided under the contracts 
after june  which is the contracting payers year end  we submit cost reports which are used by the contracting payers to determine the amount  if any  by which funds paid to us for services provided under the contracts were greater than the allowable costs to provide these services 
completion of this review process may take several years from the date we submit the cost report 
in cases where funds paid to us exceed the allowable costs to provide services under contract  we may be required to pay back the excess funds 
our cost reports are routinely audited on an annual basis 
we periodically review our provisional billing rates and allocation of costs and provide for estimated adjustments from the contracting payers 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made in our consolidated financial statements for any adjustments that might result from the outcome of any cost report audits 
differences between the amounts provided and the settlement amounts are recorded in our consolidated statement of income in the year of settlement 
cost based service contracts represented approximately and of our revenue for the years ended december  and 
table of contents annual block purchase contract 
our annual block purchase contract with the community partnership of southern arizona  referred to as cpsa  requires us to provide or arrange for behavioral health services to eligible populations of beneficiaries as defined in the contract 
we must provide a complete range of behavioral health clinical  case management  therapeutic and administrative services 
with the approval of the arizona state medicaid authority we no longer have to provide services to every client referred under this contract effective september   but we are obliged to provide services only to those clients with a demonstrated medical necessity 
since adopting the medical necessity criteria  we have been able to operate within the annual funding allocation guidelines 
our annual funding allocation amount is subject to increase when our encounters exceed the contract amount  however  such increases in the annual funding allocation amount are subject to government appropriation and may not be approved 
there is no contractual limit to the number of eligible beneficiaries that may be assigned to us  or a specified limit to the level of services that may be provided to these beneficiaries if the services are deemed to be medically necessary 
therefore  we are at risk if the costs of providing necessary services exceed the associated reimbursement 
we are required to regularly submit service encounters to cpsa electronically 
on an on going basis and at the end of cpsa s june fiscal year  cpsa is obligated to monitor the level of service encounters 
if at any time the encounter data is not sufficient to support the year to date payments made to us  cpsa has the right to prospectively reduce or suspend payments to us 
for revenue recognition purposes  our service encounter value which represents the value of actual services rendered must equal or exceed of the revenue recognized under our annual block purchase contract 
the remaining of revenue recognized each reporting period represents payment for network overhead administrative costs incurred in order to fulfill our obligations under the contract 
administrative costs include  but are not limited to  intake services  clinical liaison oversight for each behavioral health recipient  cultural liaisons  financial assessments and screening  data processing and information systems  staff training  quality and utilization management functions  coordination of care and subcontract administration 
we recognize revenue from our annual block purchase contract corresponding to the service encounter value 
if our service encounter value is less than of the amounts received from cpsa  we recognize revenue equal to the service encounter value and defer revenue for any excess amounts received 
cpsa has not reduced  withheld  or suspended any payments and we believe our encounter data is sufficient to have earned all amounts recorded as revenue under this contract 
if our service encounter value equals of the amounts received from cpsa  we recognize revenue at the contract amount  which is one twelfth of the established annual contract amount each month 
if our service encounter value exceeds of the contract amount  we recognize revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount if collection is reasonably assured 
prior to september   evidence that the collection of additional revenue over the contractual amount was reasonably assured was primarily based on consistent historical evidence of supplemental payments from cpsa 
subsequent to september   we evaluate additional factors regarding payment probability related to the determination of whether any such additional revenue over the contractual amount is considered to be reasonably assured 
the terms of the contract may be reviewed prospectively and amended as necessary to ensure adequate funding of our contractual obligations 
our revenues under the annual block purchase contract and for the years ended december  and represented and of our total revenues  respectively 
management agreements 
we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations whereby we provide certain management services for these organizations 
in exchange for our services  we receive a management fee that is either based on a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
management fees earned under our management agreements represented approximately of our revenue for the years ended december  and 
table of contents we recognize management fees revenue from our management agreements as such amounts are earned  as defined by the respective management agreements  and collection of such amount is considered reasonably assured 
we assess the likelihood of whether any of our management fees may need to be returned to help our managed entities fund their working capital needs 
if the likelihood is other than remote  we defer the recognition of all or a portion of the management fees received 
to the extent we defer management fees as a means of funding any of our managed entities losses from operations  such amounts are not recognized as management fees revenue until they are ultimately collected from the operating income of the managed entities 
in addition  as part of our reinsurance program  we reinsure a substantial portion of the general and professional liability and workers compensation cost of certain designated entities we manage through our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  social services providers captive insurance company  or spcic 
further  we offered health insurance coverage to employees of certain entities we manage under our self funded health insurance program through june in exchange for this liability coverage  we received a reimbursement equal to the pro rata share of the participating managed entities costs related to our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs 
we recorded amounts received from these managed entities as management fees revenue 
revenues related to these arrangements totaled approximately million and  million for the years ended december  and  and represented less than of our revenue for the same periods 
consulting agreements 
from time to time we may enter into consulting agreements with other entities that provide government sponsored social services 
under the agreements  we evaluate and make recommendations with respect to their management  administrative and operational services 
we may continue to enter into consulting agreements in the future 
in exchange for these consulting services  we receive a fixed fee that is either payable upon completion of the services or on a monthly basis 
these consulting agreements are generally short term in nature and are subject to termination by either party at any time  for any reason  upon advance written notice 
revenues related to these services are recognized at the time such consulting services are rendered and collection is determined to be reasonably assured 
fees earned pursuant to our consulting agreements are classified as management fees revenue in our consolidated statements of operations and represented less than of our revenue for the years ended december  and the costs associated with generating our management fee and consulting fee revenues are accounted for in client service expense and in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts clients are referred to us through governmental social services programs and we only provide services at the direction of a payer under a contractual arrangement 
these circumstances have historically minimized any uncollectible amounts for services rendered 
however  we recognize that not all amounts recorded as accounts receivable will ultimately be collected 
we record all accounts receivable amounts at their contracted amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk that an account will not be collected 
we regularly evaluate our accounts receivable  especially receivables that are past due  and reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on specific client collection issues 
we pay particular attention to amounts outstanding for days and longer 
any account receivable older than days is deemed uncollectible and written off or fully allowed for unless we have specific information from the payer that payment for those amounts is forthcoming 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific payer s inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific addition to our allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
under certain of our contracts  billings do not coincide with revenue recognized on the contract due to payer administrative issues 
these unbilled accounts receivable represent revenue recorded for which no amount has been invoiced 
unbilled amounts are expected to be billed within one year 

table of contents our write off experience for the years ended december   and was less than of revenue 
accounting for business combinations  goodwill and other intangible assets when we consummate an acquisition we separately value all acquired identifiable intangible assets apart from goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
we analyze the carrying value of goodwill at the end of each fiscal year and between annual valuations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when determining whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill 
we use valuation techniques consistent with a market approach by deriving a multiple of our ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization based on the market value of our common stock at year end and then applying this multiple to each reporting unit s ebitda for the year to determine the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss is measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying value 
in calculating the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other identifiable assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed as of december  resulted in no impairment losses 
in connection with our acquisitions  we allocated a portion of the purchase consideration to management contracts and customer relationships based on the expected direct or indirect contribution to future cash flows on a discounted cash flow basis over the useful life of the assets  and we consider allocating goodwill to existing reporting units which benefit from synergies after the acquisition 
we accrue contingent amounts in an acquisition up to the amount of identifiable net assets 
we assess whether any relevant factors limit the period over which acquired assets are expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows for amortization purposes 
we determine an appropriate useful life for acquired customer relationships based on the expected period of time we will provide services to the payer 
while we use discounted cash flows to value intangible assets  we have elected to use the straight line method of amortization to determine amortization expense 
if applicable  we assess the recoverability of the unamortized balance of our long lived assets based on undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the review indicates that the carrying value is not fully recoverable  the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of any long lived asset is recognized as an impairment loss 
accounting for management agreement relationships due to the nature of our business and the requirement or desire by certain payers to contract with not for profit social services organizations  we sometimes enter into management contracts with not for profit social services organizations where we provide them with business development  administrative  program and other management services 
these not for profit organizations contract directly with state and local agencies to supply a variety of community based mental health and foster care services to children and adults 
each of these organizations is separately incorporated and organized with its own independent board of directors 
our management agreements with these not for profit organizations require us to provide management  accounting  advisory  supportive  consultative and administrative services  
table of contents require us to provide the necessary resources to effectively manage the business and services provided  require that we hire  supervise and terminate personnel  review existing personnel policies and assist in adopting and implementing progressive personnel policies  and compensate us with a management fee in exchange for the services provided 
all of our management services are subject to the approval or direction of the managed entities board of directors 
the accounting for our relationships with these organizations is based on a number of judgments regarding certain facts related to the control of these organizations and the terms of our management agreements 
any significant changes in the facts upon which these judgments are based could have a significant impact on our accounting for these relationships 
we have concluded that our management agreements do not meet the provisions of emerging issues task force  application of fasb statement no 
and apb opinion no 
to physician practice management entities and certain other entities with consolidated management agreements  or the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised  or interpretation no 
r  thus the operations of these organizations are not consolidated with our operations 
we will evaluate the impact of the provisions of interpretation no 
r  if any  on future acquired management agreements 
loss reserves for certain reinsurance and self funded insurance programs we maintain reserves for obligations related to our reinsurance programs for our general and professional liability and workers compensation coverage  and our self funded health insurance program provided to our employees and employees of certain entities we manage 
as of december  and  we had reserves of approximately million and million  respectively  for the general and professional liability and workers compensation programs  and approximately  and  respectively  in reserve for our self funded health insurance program which began july  we utilize analyses prepared by third party administrators and independent actuaries based on historical claims information with respect to our general and professional liability coverage  workers compensation coverage and health insurance coverage 
with respect to our self funded health insurance program  we also consider historical and projected medical utilization data when estimating our health insurance program liability and related expense 
we record claims expense by plan year based on the lesser of the aggregate stop loss if applicable or the developed losses as calculated by independent actuaries with respect to our general and professional liability coverage  and our past experience and industry experience with respect to our workers compensation coverage and health insurance coverage 
we continually analyze our reserves for incurred but not reported claims  and for reported but not paid claims related to our reinsurance and self funded insurance programs and believe these reserves to be adequate 
however  significant judgment is involved in assessing these reserves such as assessing historical paid claims  average lags between the claims incurred date  reported dates and paid dates  and the frequency and severity of claims 
we are at risk for differences between actual settlement amounts and recorded reserves and any resulting adjustments are included in expense once a probable amount is known 
there were no such adjustments recorded in the periods covered by this report 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under these programs above our reserves could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payments at fair value 
with respect to stock option awards  the fair value is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing formula 
table of contents and amortized over the option s vesting periods 
the black scholes merton option pricing formula requires us to make assumptions for the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility  life of options and risk free interest rate 
we adopted the requirements of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method in which compensation costs are recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
other than certain options previously issued at amounts below fair market value for accounting and reporting purposes in and the expense associated with the acceleration of vesting of all outstanding stock options in  no other stock based compensation cost has been reflected in our net income prior to the adoption of sfas r 
financial results for prior periods have not been restated 
sfas r indicates that for purposes of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of statement r  or apic pool  an entity shall include the net excess tax benefits that would have qualified as such had the entity adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for recognition purposes 
for this purpose  we initially chose to follow the method prescribed by sfas r  known as the long form method to calculate our apic pool amount 
subsequent to the date on which sfas r was issued but before the required date of adoption of sfas r  the fasb staff issued fasb staff position no 
fas r transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  or fsp r  which provided for an alternative to the long form method set forth in sfas r for calculating the apic pool 
this method  known as the short cut method  offers a simplified approach to calculating the apic pool 
among the benefits of the short cut method are simplicity in performing the apic pool calculation and a lower likelihood of error 
under the effective date and transition provisions of fsp r  an entity that adopts the provisions of sfas r using either the modified retrospective or modified prospective transition application may make a one time election to adopt the short cut method described in this fsp 
an entity may take up to one year from the later of its initial adoption of statement r or the effective date of fsp r to evaluate its available transition alternatives and make its one time election 
on december   we elected to use the short cut method described in fsp r in accordance with the effective date and transition provisions thereof 
there was no effect on our financial results for related to the application of the short cut method to determine our apic pool balance 
prior to january   we followed the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation plans and presented all benefits of tax deductions resulting from the exercise of stock based awards as operating cash flows in our statements of cash flows 
under sfas r  the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the estimated tax benefit of compensation costs recognized in the income statement for those options are classified as financing cash flows 
for the years ended december   and  the amount of excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options was approximately  million and million  respectively 
these amounts are reflected as cash flows from operating activities for the years ended december  and and financing activities for the year ended december  in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
on december   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting dates of all unvested stock options outstanding as of december  the purpose of accelerating the vesting of outstanding unvested options was to enable us to avoid recognizing approximately million in associated stock based compensation expense in future periods as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
on may   our stockholders approved the providence service corporation long term incentive plan  or plan 
the plan allows us the flexibility to issue up to  shares of our common stock pursuant to awards of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  unrestricted stock  
table of contents stock units including restricted stock units and performance awards to employees  directors  consultants  advisors and others who are in a position to make contributions to our success and to encourage such persons to take into account our long term interests and the interests of our stockholders through ownership of our common stock or securities with value tied to our common stock 
as of december   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under the plan 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the total fair value of shares vested during and was results of operations segment reporting 
all of our operating entities have been aggregated into one reporting segment under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  or sfas accordingly  our consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of our single reporting segment 
our operating entities provide social services to a common customer group  principally individuals and families 
all of our operating entities follow similar operating procedures and methods in managing their operations and each operating entity works within a similar regulatory environment  primarily under medicaid regulations 
we manage our operating activities by actual to budget comparisons within each operating entity rather than by comparison between entities 
our actual operating contribution margins by operating entity range from approximately to 
we believe that the long term operating contribution margins of our operating entities will approximate as the respective entities markets mature  we cross sell our services within markets  and standardize our operating model among entities including recent acquisitions 
we also believe that our targeted contribution margin of approximately is allowable by our state and local governmental payers over the long term 
our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews financial and non financial information for each individual entity 
while financial performance in comparison to budget is evaluated on an entity by entity basis  our operating entities are aggregated into one reporting segment for financial reporting purposes because we believe that the operating entities exhibit similar long term financial performance 
in addition  our revenues  costs and contribution margins are not significantly affected by allocating more or less resources to individual operating entities because the economic characteristics of our business are substantially dependent upon market demographics that are beyond our control which affect the amount and type of services in demand as well as our cost structure eg payroll and contract rates with payers 
in conjunction with the financial performance trends  we believe the similar qualitative characteristics of our operating entities and budgetary constraints of our payers in each market provide a foundation to conclude that our businesses have similar economic characteristics 
thus  we believe the economic characteristics of our operating entities meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reporting segment under sfas

partially offsetting the increase in home and community based services revenue for the year ended december  was a decrease in our district of columbia market where we have experienced a decrease in the services we provide in this market 

table of contents in the district of columbia  eligibility requirements for social services clients have been tightened to stratify services into intensity levels to stabilize the number of eligible clients 
the tightened eligibility requirements have led to a reduction in the number of clients eligible for higher level services for which we are authorized to provide  and reduced the total population of eligible clients in this market resulting in a decrease in our home and community based services revenue of approximately million for as compared to in response to the tightened eligibility requirements of the government entities that fund the services we provide in the district of columbia market  we are focusing on cross selling activities to enhance the current continuum of social services we provide

stock based compensation 
stock based compensation of approximately  for represents the amortization of the fair value of stock options and stock grants awarded to employees in june under our plan 
no stock based compensation was recorded for as we followed the intrinsic value method to account for stock based awards granted to employees at that time 
the intrinsic value method did not require us to record stock based compensation for awards granted at exercise prices equal to the market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
general and administrative expense

on april   we prepaid approximately million of the principal and accrued interest then outstanding related to our credit facility with cit out of the net proceeds from the follow on offering of our common stock that was completed on april  as a result  interest expense for was higher than that for due to a higher level of debt for as compared to interest income 
the increase in interest income for as compared to the prior year resulted from interest earned on the net proceeds from the follow on offering of our common stock completed in april which were deposited into an interest bearing account 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on our estimated annual effective income tax rate for the full fiscal year equal to approximately 
our estimated effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible permanent differences such as client and employee meals and state income taxes 
at december   we have future tax benefits of million related to million of available federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire in years through and million of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in through as a result of statutory ownership changes as defined for purposes of section of the internal revenue code  our ability to utilize our net operating losses is restricted 
we are unable to utilize net operating losses of approximately  that expire in due to this restriction 
our valuation allowance includes million of state net operating loss carryforwards and  of federal net operating loss carryforwards for which we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in the ordinary course of operations 
in addition  we recognized certain tax benefits related to stock option plans for the years ended december  and in the amount of million and million  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues year ended december  percent change home and community based services foster care services management fees total revenue home and community based services 
the acquisition of pottsville behavioral counseling group now known as providence community services  inc  or pcs  in april and equity interests in three entities  collectively referred to as the aspen companies  comprising of choices group  inc  aspen mso  llc now known as providence community services  llc and college community services  in july contributed approximately million in home and community based services revenue for as compared to as the operations of these acquisitions were included only from the date of acquisition 
in addition  we acquired cbh in june  maple star nevada in august  alphacare in september and drawbridges in october which added  on a cumulative basis  approximately million to our home and community based services revenue for further  services in the district of columbia which began in june yielded 
table of contents additional home and community based services revenue of approximately million for as compared to the prior year because the operations in the district of columbia were included for only the last six months of also  we recognized approximately million of home and community based services revenue in excess of the annual funding allocation amount under our annual block purchase contract with cpsa for approximately million of the total amount recognized as home and community based services revenue under this contract in excess of the annual funding allocation amount has been collected through supplemental payments 
the supplemental payments received from cpsa are in addition to the annual contract amounts we were entitled to receive under our annual block purchase contract for services rendered and are at the discretion of cpsa 
due to the discretionary nature of the supplemental payments and despite the fact that we have been awarded such payments historically under our annual block purchase contract  historical supplemental payments are not necessarily indicative of future supplemental payments that we may receive 
excluding the acquisitions completed in and  start up services in the district of columbia in and the home and community based services revenue recognized in excess of the annual funding allocation amount under our contract with cpsa in  our home and community based services provided additional revenue of approximately million for  as compared to due to client volume increases in new and existing locations 
due to the nature of government funded social services  rates paid for social services provided generally do not fluctuate substantially from year to year 
thus  fluctuations in rates for our home and community based services have a nominal affect on our home and community based services revenue 
foster care services 
in our traditional home and community based markets such as arizona and virginia and in delaware  where we are expanding our foster care services  our cross selling efforts yielded an additional million of foster care services revenue for as compared to we expect cross selling activities to continue and provide additional revenues in the future as we focus on continuous expansion of our foster care services 
the acquisition of maple star nevada resulted in an increase in foster care services revenue of approximately million from period to period 
partially offsetting the increase in foster care services revenue in were decreases in our tennessee and nebraska markets where we have experienced a decrease in the number of clients placed in foster homes due to systemic changes at the state level and lower inventory of licensed foster homes 
in tennessee certain changes at the state level have led to a shorter length of stay per client and a lower number of clients eligible to receive care which resulted in a decrease in foster care services revenue of approximately  for as compared to in nebraska the inventory of licensed foster homes has declined leading to a decrease in the number of clients placed in foster homes and a decrease in foster care services revenue of approximately  for as compared to we are exploring opportunities to permanently place foster care clients through adoption programs in tennessee which we expect will mitigate the decline in foster care clients and the decrease in foster care services revenue 
in addition  we are increasing our efforts to recruit additional homes in nebraska which we expect will increase our foster care service offering 
further offsetting the increase in foster care services revenue in was a decrease in our florida market where a number of our foster care clients have transitioned from a higher level of foster care services to a lower level of foster care services for which we receive a lower rate 
these lower rates led to a decrease of approximately  in funds from the contracting payers to provide foster care services for as compared to management fees 
revenue for entities we manage but do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes managed entity revenue increased to million for as compared to million for the combined effects of business growth and the acquisition of the management agreements with care development of maine  or cdom  fcp  inc  or fcp  the redco group  or redco  maple star colorado  inc 
and maple star oregon  inc yielded approximately million in additional management fees revenue for as compared to  net of a decrease in management fees revenue from our amended management services agreement with rio grande behavioral health services  inc  or rio grande  described below 
in addition  we entered into several short term consulting agreements in which added another million to management fees revenue for revenues from consulting fees are not indicative of future revenues from consulting services that we may provide in the future 
further  we earned an additional million for under our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs in which certain of the entities we manage participate 
no such amounts were recorded in as our reinsurance and self funded health insurance programs did not exist until 
table of contents on june   rio grande  received a notice canceling one of its provider health maintenance organization network contracts effective july  subsequently  rio grande commenced negotiations for a new contract 
rio grande and the payer agreed to continue their relationship under new terms 
in connection with this agreement  we amended the management services agreement between us and rio grande to change the management fee charged to rio grande for certain management services from a per member per month based fee to a fixed fee per month 
the fixed fee was comparable to the previous per member per month based fee and remained at this predetermined level until january   at which time the fixed fee was reduced 
the new fixed fee had the effect of decreasing our management fees revenue from this management services agreement by approximately  for when compared to partially offsetting this decrease  however  was a management fee of  received in under the amended management services agreement with rio grande for start up costs related to implementing pending changes to the rio grande behavioral health network described below 
prior to july   the state of new mexico contracted with three health maintenance organization s and rio grande directly to administer a substantial portion of the state s behavioral health services to recipients including medicaid eligible recipients in southern new mexico 
the three health maintenance organizations  in turn  contracted with rio grande which had subcontracts with several not for profit providers in southern new mexico many of which comprise the rio grande behavioral health network to provide behavioral health services to medicaid eligible recipients 
in addition  rio grande contracted with us to provide it with certain management services 
effective july   the state of new mexico modified its behavioral health services delivery system  whereby it contracts with one administrative services entity to administer new and renewing contracts for behavioral health services 
in response to the modification of the state of new mexico s behavioral health services delivery system  the not for profit providers of the rio grande behavioral health network began contracting directly with the administrative services entity chosen by the state of new mexico 
the then existing provider subcontracts with rio grande were not renewed  however  the not for profit providers contracted with rio grande for certain administrative services 
in addition  six of the not for profit providers signed management services agreements with us 
the management fees pursuant to these management services agreements are based on a flat fee and in total is comparable to the per member per month based management fee we previously charged to rio grande 
management fees revenue related to rio grande was approximately million for and approximately million for operating expenses client service expense 
client service expense includes the following for and year ended december  percent change payroll and related costs purchased services other operating expenses total client service expense payroll and related costs 
to support our growth  provide high quality service and meet increasing compliance requirements expected by the government agencies with which we contract to provide services  we must hire and retain employees that possess higher degrees of education  experience and licensures 
as we enter new markets  we expect payroll and related costs to continue to increase 
as a result of increasing client numbers requiring us to hire additional service personnel  our payroll and related costs increased for  as compared to 
table of contents  as we added new direct care providers  administrative staff and other employees 
in addition  we added new employees in connection with the acquisition of pcs  the aspen companies  cbh  maple star nevada  alphacare and drawbridges which resulted in an increase in payroll and related costs of approximately million for we continually evaluate client census  case loads and client eligibility to determine our staffing needs under each contract in order to optimize the quality of service we provide while managing the payroll and related costs to provide these services 
determining our staffing needs may not directly coincide with the generation of revenue as we are required at times to increase our capacity to provide services prior to starting new contracts 
alternatively  we may lag behind in client referrals as we may have difficulty recruiting employees to staff our contracts 
furthermore  acquisitions may cause fluctuations in our payroll and related costs as a percentage of revenue from period to period as we attempt to merge new operations into our service delivery system 
as a percentage of revenue  payroll and related costs increased from for to for the same current year period primarily due to our efforts to increase the number of employees to service our growth 
purchased services 
increases in the number of referrals requiring pharmacy  support services and out of home placement under our annual block purchase contract and increases in foster parent payments accounted for the increase in purchased services for the as compared to we strive to manage our purchased services costs by constantly seeking alternative treatments to costly services that we do not provide 
although we manage and provide alternative treatments to clients requiring out of home placements and other purchased services  we sometimes cannot control the number of referrals requiring out of home placement and support services under our annual block purchase contract 
despite the increase in purchased services during  as a percentage of revenue  purchased services remained relatively constant near from period to period 
other operating expenses

in addition  as a result of the acceleration of vesting of stock options and the granting of stock options to a significant consultant of the company in under our stock option plan  stock based compensation expense for increased approximately  over furthermore  as a result of our growth during the last twelve months  rent and facilities management increased million in part due to our acquisition activities 
we adjusted our reserves for general and professional liability  workers compensation liability and self funded health insurance programs to be in line with an independent actuary estimate under our reinsurance programs and  with respect to our self funded health insurance program liability  projected medical utilization data 
these adjustments resulted in a decrease in general and administrative expense of approximately  for as compared to as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expense remained relatively constant at 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
year ended december  percent change the increase in depreciation and amortization from period to period primarily resulted from the amortization of customer relationships of approximately  related to the acquisition of pcs  the aspen companies  cbh  maple star nevada  alphacare and drawbridges 
also contributing to the increase in depreciation and amortization was the amortization of the fair value of the acquired management agreements with cdom  fcp  redco and maple star nevada and increased depreciation expense due to the addition of software and computer equipment during the last twelve months

our estimated effective income tax rate differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible permanent differences such as client and employee meals and state income taxes 
at december   we have future tax benefits of million related to million of available federal net operating loss carryforwards which expire in years through and million of state net operating loss carryforwards which expire in through approximately million of the federal net operating loss carryforwards result from the camelot care corporation acquisition in the future use of these net operating loss carryforwards is limited on an annual basis 
our valuation allowance includes million of state net operating loss carryforwards and  of federal net operating loss carryforwards for which we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized in the ordinary course of operations 
quarterly results the following table presents quarterly historical financial information for the eight quarters ended december  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited and has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we believe the quarterly information contains all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary to fairly present this information when read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report

although these revenues are not our revenues  because we provide substantially all administrative functions for these entities and a significant portion of our management fees is based on a percentage of their revenues  we believe that the presentation of managed entity revenue provides investors with an additional measure of the size of the operations under our administration and can help them understand trends in our management fee revenue 
revenues for the quarter ended june  included million in supplemental payments under our annual block purchase contract with cpsa 
these supplemental payments are in addition to the amount we were due under the annual block purchase contract and were at the discretion of cpsa 
accordingly  these supplemental payments may not be indicative of future supplemental payments

historically  these seasonal variations have had a nominal affect on our operating results and operating cash flows 
as we have grown our home and community based services business  our exposure to seasonal variations has grown and will continue to grow  particularly with respect to our school based services  educational services and tutoring services 
we experience lower home and community based services revenue when school is not in session 
our expenses  however  do not vary significantly with these changes and  as a result  such expenses do not fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results and operating cash flows to continue as a result of the uneven seasonal demand for our home and community based services 
moreover  as we enter new markets  we could be subject to additional seasonal variations along with any competitive response to our entry by other social services providers 
liquidity and capital resources sources of cash for were from operations  cash received upon exercise of stock options and proceeds from our follow on public offering of our common stock completed in april our balance of cash and cash equivalents was approximately million at december   up from million at december  the increase was primarily due to the proceeds from our follow on offering of our common stock and cash received upon exercise of stock options partially offset by our acquisition activity during  the repayment of a portion of our long term debt  the payment of estimated income taxes and insurance premiums

if the seller prevails under the dispute resolution provision of the purchase agreement  we may be obligated to pay the difference between the amount paid and the maximum earn out amount of million in the contingent consideration will be paid in cash 
in connection with the acquisition of alphacare in  we may be obligated to pay to the sellers an additional amount under an earn out provision pursuant to a formula specified in the purchase agreement that is based upon certain factors  including the ebitda of certain programs of alphacare 
the payment would be made in the second fiscal quarter of if the earn out provision is met  the contingent consideration will be paid one third in cash  one third by delivery of an unsecured  subordinated promissory note and the balance in shares of our unregistered common stock  the value of which will be determined in accordance with the provisions of the purchase agreement 
in connection with the acquisition of a to z  we were obligated to pay to the former members of a to z in each of  and  an additional amount under an earn out provision pursuant to a formula specified in the purchase agreement based upon the future financial performance of a to z 
on july  and october   we entered into separate settlement agreements with the sellers of a to z to release us from our obligation to make any additional purchase price payments to the sellers in exchange for  and million less approximately  for the sale by us to the seller of certain accounts receivable of a to z in cash  respectively 
payments were made by us to the seller on july  related to the july  settlement agreement and november  related to the october  settlement agreement 
the settlement amounts were added to the cost of acquiring a to z 
as a result of these settlement agreements with the sellers  we have no further obligations to the sellers under the earn out provision of the purchase agreement 
we may be obligated to pay  in the second fiscal quarter of  an additional amount under an earn out provision as such term is defined in the purchase agreement related to the purchase of fbs 
if the earn out provision is met  the contingent consideration will be paid in cash

when and if the earn out provision is triggered and paid under the purchase agreement with respect to maple star nevada  alphacare  fbs and wd management  we will record the fair value of the consideration paid  issued or issuable as an additional cost to acquire these entities 

table of contents management agreements we maintain management agreements with a number of not for profit social services organizations that require us to provide management and administrative services for each organization 
in exchange for these services  we receive a management fee that is either based upon a percentage of the revenues of these organizations or a predetermined fee 
the not for profit social service organizations managed by us that qualify under section c of the internal revenue code  referred to as a c entity  each maintain a board of directors  a majority of which are independent 
all economic decisions by the board of any c entity that affect us are made by the independent board members 
our management agreements with each c entity are typically subject to third party fairness opinions from an independent appraiser retained by the independent board members of the tax exempt organizations 
management fees generated under our management agreements represented of our revenue for and fees generated under short term consulting agreements represented less than of our revenue for and in accordance with our management agreements with these not for profit organizations  we have obligations to manage their business and services which generally includes selecting and employing the senior operations management personnel 
management fee receivable at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and management fee revenue was recognized on all of these receivables 
in order to enhance liquidity of the entities we manage  we may allow the managed entities to defer payment of their respective management fees 
in addition  since government contractors who provide social or similar services to government beneficiaries sometimes experience collection delays due to either lack of proper documentation of claims  government budgetary processes or similar reasons outside the contractors control either directly or as managers of other contracting entities  we generally do not consider a management fee receivable to be uncollectible due solely to its age until it is days old 
the following is a summary of the aging of our management fee receivable balances as of december   march  june  september  and december  at less than days days days days over days december  march  june  september  december  we experienced an increase in the amount of management fee receivable older than days as of june  primarily due to year end payer reconciliation processes and the conversion of our managed entities payers claims processing function from state medicaid to medicaid health maintenance organizations 
these events impacted our managed entities cash flows by creating short term delays in claims processing which in turn affected the ability of our managed entities to pay their management fees during the three months ended june  each month we examine each of our managed entities with regard to its solvency  outlook and ability to pay us any outstanding management fees 
if the likelihood that we will not be paid is other than remote  we defer the recognition of these management fees until we are certain that payment is probable

table of contents reinsurance and self funded insurance programs reinsurance we reinsure a substantial portion of our general and professional liability and workers compensation costs and the general and professional liability and workers compensation costs of certain designated entities we manage under reinsurance programs through spcic 
these decisions were made based on current conditions in the insurance marketplace that have led to increasingly higher levels of self insurance retentions  increasing number of coverage limitations  and fluctuating insurance premium rates 
the following table summarizes our insurance coverage under its reinsurance programs reinsurance program policy year ending reinsuance liability per loss with no annual aggregate limit expected loss during policy year third party coverage annual aggregate limit general and professional liability april     workers compensation liability may    up to applicable statutory limits effective april   our reinsurance policy with respect to our general and professional liability reinsurance program was renewed under substantially the same terms as the prior year s policy 
pursuant to a renegotiation of this policy  effective may   spcic reinsures the third party insurer for general and professional liability exposures for the first dollar of each and every loss up to million per loss and million in the aggregate 
the gross written premium for this policy is approximately million and the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception of this reinsurance program in at december   as indicated by the most recent independent actuarial report dated february   is approximately  the excess premium over our expected losses may be used to fund spcic s operating expenses  any deficit arising in the workers compensation liability coverage  to provide for surplus reserves and to fund other risk management activities 
in addition  we are insured under an umbrella liability insurance policy providing additional coverage in the amount of million per occurrence and million in the aggregate in excess of the policy limits of the general and professional liability policy 
effective may   spcic reinsures a third party insurer for the first dollar of each and every loss up to  per occurrence with no annual aggregate limit 
the third party insurer provides us with a deductible buy back policy with a limit of  per occurrence that provides coverage for all states where coverage is required 
the gross written premium for this policy is approximately million which is ceded to spcic 
the cumulative reserve for expected losses since inception of this reinsurance program in at december   as predicted by the most recent independent actuarial report dated february   is approximately million 
in addition  we have two workers compensation policies with this third party insurer providing statutory limits in excess of the  reinsurance limit  one for california and one for all other states for which we are required to provide workers compensation insurance 
spcic had restricted cash of approximately million at december  and approximately million at december   which is restricted to secure the reinsured claims losses of spcic under the general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs 
the full extent of claims may not be fully determined for years 
therefore  the estimates of potential obligations are based on recommendations of an independent actuary using historical data  industry data  and our experience 
although we believe that the amounts accrued for losses incurred but not reported under the terms of our reinsurance programs are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with these claims made under these programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
under our general and professional liability and workers compensation reinsurance programs  we may be required to restrict up to an additional million in our second fiscal quarter of to secure the reinsured losses of spcic based on an independent actuary s estimate of such losses for the policy years beginning april  and may

health claims under this program are self funded with a stop loss umbrella policy with a third party insurer to limit the maximum potential liability for individual claims to  per person and for total claims up to million for the program year ending june  health insurance claims are paid as they are submitted to the plan administrator 
we maintain accruals for claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plan administrator and therefore have not been paid 
the incurred but not reported reserve is based on the historical claim lag period and current payment trends of health insurance claims 
the liability for the self funded health plan of approximately  and  as of december  and  respectively  is recorded in reinsurance liability reserve in our consolidated balance sheets 
we charge our employees a portion of the costs of our self funded group health insurance programs  and we determine this charge at the beginning of each plan year based upon historical and projected medical utilization data 
any difference between our projections and our actual experience is borne by us 
effective july   the managed entities that previously participated in our self funded and non self funded health programs obtained separate health insurance policies 
we are estimating potential obligations for liabilities under this program to reserve what we believe to be a sufficient amount to cover liabilities based on our past experience 
any significant increase in the number of claims or costs associated with claims made under this program above what we reserve could have a material adverse effect on our financial results
