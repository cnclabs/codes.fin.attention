item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview telik is engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of small molecule drugs 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our expenses have consisted primarily of those incurred for research and development and general and administrative costs associated with our operations 
the process of carrying out the development of our product candidates to later stages of development and our research programs may require significant additional research and development expenditures  including for preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as for manufacturing development efforts and obtaining regulatory approval 
we outsource our clinical trials and our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  including non equity payments from collaborative partners 
we are subject to risks common to biopharmaceutical companies  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  the need for future capital  potential competition  use of hazardous materials and retention of key employees 
in order for a product to be commercialized  it will be necessary for us to conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate reimbursement from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the timing and extent of our research and development efforts and the outcome of our clinical trial activities 
the successful development of our products is uncertain 
as such  an accurate prediction of future operating results is difficult or impossible 
clinical status telcyta  our lead product candidate  is a small molecule tumor activated cancer product candidate that we are evaluating initially to treat cancers that are resistant to standard chemotherapy drugs 
on december  we announced preliminary results from our first three randomized telcyta phase registration trials  known as the assist trials 
the following summarizes the preliminary results of those trials assist is a patient multinational  randomized phase trial designed to evaluate telcyta as compared to the active control agents liposomal doxorubicin or topotecan in the third line therapy of platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
the assist trial did not achieve the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for telcyta as compared to the active controls 
while the preliminary analysis revealed a number of internal inconsistencies that need to be further investigated  resolution of these inconsistencies may not change the preliminary results 
assist is a patient multinational  randomized phase trial designed to evaluate telcyta as compared to gefitinib in the third line therapy of advanced non small cell lung cancer 
the assist trial did not achieve the primary endpoint of demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in overall survival for telcyta as compared to the active control 
assist is a patient randomized phase trial conducted in the us designed to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall objective response rate with the combination of telcyta plus carboplatin compared to liposomal doxorubicin in the second line treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer 

table of contents under the trial protocol  patients were to have received treatment until tumor progression or unacceptable toxicity 
however  a major discordance was observed between the clinical review of the tumor scans and the independent radiology review 
approximately of the patients were discontinued prematurely from the assigned study treatment as judged by the independent review of the scans 
therefore  we believe the trial was compromised and may not be suitable for a regulatory submission 
objective tumor responses were observed on the investigational arms containing telcyta in all three trials based on the prospective central blinded independent radiology review 
preliminary analysis of the safety data from the assist and assist trials  in which telcyta was administered as monotherapy  indicates that telcyta was generally well tolerated 
telcyta treatment was associated with mild to moderate nausea  vomiting and fatigue 
preliminary analysis of the safety data from the assist trial  combining telcyta plus carboplatin  demonstrated toxicities expected of each drug alone and no unexpected or cumulative toxicities were reported 
further analyses of each of these trials is underway 
we also have a patient  multinational randomized phase clinical trial  assist  initiated in may  evaluating telcyta in combination with liposomal doxorubicin versus liposomal doxorubicin as second line therapy in platinum refractory or resistant ovarian cancer 
enrollment is ongoing in this trial in addition  we have conducted two phase clinical trials of telcyta for the treatment of stage iiib or iv non small cell lung cancer for patients who have not previously received chemotherapy 
one clinical trial is in combination with cisplatin  and the other clinical trial is in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
platinum and taxane based drug combinations are the current standard for the front line chemotherapy of lung and ovarian cancer 
telintra  our second product candidate  is a small molecule bone marrow stimulant we are developing for the treatment of blood disorders associated with low blood cell levels  such as neutropenia or anemia 
myelodysplastic syndrome  or mds  is a disease characterized by defects in the blood producing cells of the bone marrow  in which low blood cell levels occur 
a phase clinical trial in patients with mds was completed and we announced positive clinical data in december demonstrating clinically significant improvement in all blood cell lineages and across all major mds subtypes 
telintra was well tolerated in this predominantly elderly patient population 
in february we initiated a phase a trial in mds using a tablet formulation of telintra 
we also announced positive pre clinical results for telintra at the american society of hematology annual meeting in december tlk a novel metabolically activated cytotoxic small molecule with activity not restricted to gst positive cancers  was identified as a new product candidate in tlk causes apoptosis and g m cell cycle arrest in a broad array of human cancer cell lines 
it has shown significant anti tumor activity in human breast  pancreatic and colon tumors in vivo when administered either orally or by injection 
we are conducting the required preclinical safety studies to support the potential filing of an ind  application with the fda 
we discovered all of our product candidates using our proprietary technology  target related affinity profiling  or trap  which enables the rapid and efficient discovery of small molecule product candidates 
we expect to enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties for clinical trials  development  manufacturing  regulatory approvals or commercialization of some of our products  particularly outside north america  or in disease areas requiring larger and longer clinical trials than cancer 
restructuring program in february  we implemented a restructuring plan that focused our priorities on the assist trial and the phase a trial of the telintra tablet formulation and selected research and development programs 
to match these priorities  we reduced our workforce by positions and along with other cost cutting measures we expect a decrease of approximately million in operating expenses for the year as compared with the 
table of contents year ended december  as a result of the restructuring plan  we expect to record a one time restructuring charge of approximately million for severance costs and other charges in the quarter ending march  the majority of the severance payments will be paid in cash in the same period and we expect to complete the restructuring plan by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year we will continue to investigate alternative opportunities for the advancement of our product development programs  including collaborations with pharmaceutical and larger biotechnology companies 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
stock based compensation expense we grant stock options to our employees  outside directors and consultants and provide employees the right to purchase our stock pursuant to stockholder approved stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payment awards subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 share based payment sfas r 
effective january   we adopted sfas r and use the fair value method to account for share based payment awards following the modified prospective method of adoption which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing stock based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective method of adoption  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
total compensation cost for our share based payment awards recognized in was million 
because we adopted sfas r on january   there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized in and as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we were required to make significant estimates related to the adoption of sfas r 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on historical volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of 
the expected term of options granted is based on the simplified method in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab as our historical share option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis for estimation 
as such  we used a weighted average expected option life assumption of years 
if factors change and we develop different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors  consultants and third party contract research organizations and an allocation of facility and administrative costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
clinical development costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
we have a history of contracting with third parties that perform various clinical trial activities on our behalf in the on going development of our product candidates 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiation and may vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties based upon estimates of the percentage of work completed over the life of the individual study in accordance with agreements established with contract research organizations and clinical trial sites 
we determine our estimates through discussion with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible  however  if we underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods 
results of operations revenues years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages contract revenue from collaborations we have no collaborative research agreements in while revenues in and resulted from our collaborative agreement with roche 
as a result of the completion of our roche compound identification revenue amortization in march  we reported an decrease or  reduction in revenue in compared to we currently do not expect to record any revenue in the next twelve months 
future revenues will depend upon the extent to which we enter into new collaborative research agreements and the amounts of payments relating to such agreements 
research and development expenses research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were million  million and million 
our research and development activities consist primarily of drug development  clinical supply manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of product candidates and preclinical studies 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 

table of contents the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximate the following years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages research and preclinical clinical development total research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  increased by  compared to the same period in primarily due to the following clinical trial expenses approximately million associated with our assist clinical trial and initial start up costs related to our assist clinical trial  offset by decreased costs associated with our phase clinical trials in ovarian cancer and non small cell lung cancer of approximately million following the completion of patient enrollment in our assist and assist clinical trials  and corresponding decreased costs in our clinical drug supply manufacturing cost of approximately million 
other expenses approximately million associated with headcount growth and increased expenses to support clinical activities  and stock based compensation expense of approximately million the increase of  or million  in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was principally due to the increased costs for the following clinical trial expenses costs associated with our phase clinical trials of approximately million due to the initiation of our assist clinical trial partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with our assist clinical trial due to the completion of patient enrollment at the end of other expenses approximately million associated with headcount growth and increased expenses to support clinical activities 
we expect total research and development expenditures to decrease in the next twelve months as we focus on the telcyta assist clinical trial and the phase a clinical trial of the telintra tablet formulation resulting in decreased manufacturing and clinical development costs 
the timing and the amount of these expenditures will depend upon the results of the on going analyses of the completed telcyta phase trials which may result in potential changes to the assist trial  and the progress of the telintra tablet formulation phase a clinical trial 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product in development and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each product 
the information in the column labeled estimated or actual completion of 
table of contents enrollment is our current estimate of the timing of completion of enrollment 
the actual timing of completion of enrollment could differ materially from the estimates provided in the table 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing of completing a product development phase  see the risk factors all of our product candidates are in research and development 
if clinical trials of telcyta and telintra are delayed or unsuccessful or if we are unable to complete the preclinical development of our other preclinical product candidates  our business may suffer  if we do not obtain regulatory approval to market products in the united states and foreign countries  we or our collaborators will not be permitted to commercialize our product candidates  as our product programs advance  we may need to hire additional scientific and management personnel 
our research and development efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  and if we are unable to enter into or maintain existing contracts with third parties to manufacture our product candidates or any products that we may develop in sufficient quantities and at an acceptable cost  clinical development of product candidates could be delayed and we may be unable to meet demand for any products that we may develop and lose potential revenue sections of risk factors below

the largest component of our total operating expenses is our on going investments in our research and development activities and  in particular  the clinical development of our product candidate pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  filing with the fda of an ind  to conduct initial human clinical trials for drug candidates  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product  and filing by company and acceptance and approval by the fda of a new drug application  or nda  for a product candidate to allow commercial distribution of the drug 

table of contents in view of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these and other factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages general and administrative the increase of  or million in compared to the same period in was primarily due to stock based compensation expense of million 
the increase of  or  in general and administrative expenses in compared to was primarily due to increased expenses necessary to manage the growth of our operations including insurance and legal fees 
we expect future general and administrative expenses to increase by approximately percent to account for management bonuses  higher stock based compensation expense and legal fees associated with potential corporate partnerships 
there were no bonuses paid to management in interest income and interest expense years ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest income interest expense interest income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and resulted primarily from earnings on investments 
the increase in was due to higher average interest rates in the increase in was due to higher average interest rates in and higher principal balances of our investments as a result of million in net proceeds obtained from our follow on public offering of common stock in february interest expense was   and  for the years ended december   and the decreases in interest expense in and were due to decreasing outstanding principal balance as a result of payments on our lease and loan obligations and no new borrowings 
we expect interest expenditures to continue to decrease in the future as we pay down our lease and loan obligations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources in millions  except ratios december cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted cash working capital current ratio year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to the significant research and development expenditures and the lack of any approved products to generate revenue  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we incorporated in as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners  interest earned on investments and equipment lease financings 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents  investments and restricted investments of million 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including obligations of us government agencies  high grade corporate and municipal bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash used in operations for was million compared with million in and million in net loss of million in included non cash charges of million for stock based compensation and million for depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operations was further impacted by a decrease of million in accrued clinical trials expenses  primarily due to our phase clinical trials and a million decrease in accrued compensation expense primarily due to bonus payouts 
cash outflows were offset by an increase of million in accrued liabilities related mainly to manufacturing expenses and million in accounts payable 
cash used in operations in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization 
cash used in operations in was further impacted by an approximately million decrease in accounts payable primarily due to payment of clinical development activities and million repayments to our landlord for leasehold improvements which were financed by them 
cash outflows in were offset by increases of million in accrued clinical trial expenses related primarily to our phase clinical trials 
cash used in operations in resulted from a net loss of million which included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization   for the amortization of deferred stock compensation and  related to non cash stock based compensation to non employees 
cash used in operations in was offset by million in accounts payable and million in accrued liabilities primarily due to expenses related to our phase clinical trials in ovarian and non small cell lung cancers 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities for was million compared to million in and million in cash provided in was primarily from million in sales and maturities of investments offset by million in purchases of available for sale investments 
capital expenditures in were  primarily for laboratory equipment  computer equipment and software purchases 
cash was provided in by million from sales and maturities of investments  partially offset by million in purchases of investment securities

table of contents purchase of computer and laboratory equipment 
cash was provided in by million from sales and maturities of investments offset by million in purchases of investment securities 
capital expenditures for were million primarily for laboratory and computer equipment purchases cash flows from financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities for was approximately million compared with million in and million in financing activities for were comprised primarily of million in proceeds from stock option exercises and our employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by  in payments under capital leases and equipment loans 
financing activities for included approximately million in net proceeds from our follow on public offering of common stock completed in february and million from stock option exercises and stock issuances under our employee stock plans offset by million in pay down of capital leases and equipment loans 
cash provided in from financing activities of million was primarily from our stock option exercises and stock purchase plan 
working capital 
working capital decreased to million at december  from million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to our use of cash in operations due to the expansion of our telcyta development program  reclassification to non current assets of certain long term investments and costs associated with headcount growth 
in february  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock  including shares issued in connection with the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  at a price of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions and related offering expenses 
due to the re focus of our research and development strategy to mainly on the assist clinical trial and the phase a clinical trial of telintra tablets  we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to satisfy our current operating plan until the end of we expect our on going clinical development activities and in particular our phase assist clinical trial to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  we will require substantial additional financing to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
debt financing may subject us to restrictive covenants that may adversely affect our operations 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through licensing arrangements or arrangements with collaborative partners  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress and success of preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates  the progress and number of research programs in development  the costs associated with conducting phase clinical trials  the costs and timing of obtaining regulatory approvals  our ability to establish  and the scope of  any new collaborations  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the timing and scope of commercialization expenses for our product candidates as they approach regulatory approval 

table of contents we currently have no commitments for any additional financings 
if we need to raise additional money to fund our operations  funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to market our products as planned or continue development of our products  or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
our future contractual obligations at december  are as follows total after in thousands capital lease obligations equipment loans operating leases total contractual cash obligations we have a contractual obligation under the terms of our manufacturing supply agreement with organichem corporation  wherein we are obligated to purchase a significant percentage of our united states requirements for the active ingredient in telcyta for a number of years 
in addition  we are obligated to forecast our purchases  if any  of the active ingredient several quarters in advance and purchase the forecasted amount 
on the basis of our current forecasts  we have no financial obligation to organichem 
pricing of purchases under this agreement is subject to renegotiation after a defined time period 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires a company to recognize  in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis solely on the technical merit of the position 
in addition  fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures including a discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next twelve months as well as a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk exposure involves forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related mainly to changes in interest rates and we believe our exposure to market risk is immaterial 
we do not use or hold derivative financial instruments 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates we maintain investments of shorter maturities 
our marketable securities portfolio is primarily invested in corporate debt securities and commercial papers with an average maturity of under one year and a minimum investment grade rating of a or a or better to minimize credit risk 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
we have operated primarily in the united states and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not have any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio and beyond total fair value at december  in thousands  except percentages available for sale securities average interest rate
