we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
as of february   we have not issued any letters of credit for the purchase of merchandise inventory or any capital expenditures 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions about future events that impact amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the following are our most critical accounting estimates that include significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments would be made when facts and circumstances require 
historically  we have found our application of accounting estimates to be appropriate  and actual results have not differed materially from those estimated 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory consists of finished goods and is valued utilizing the cost method at lower of cost or market on a weighted average basis 
we use estimates during interim periods to record a provision for inventory shortage 
we also make certain assumptions regarding future demand and net realizable selling price in order to assess that our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
these assumptions are based on both historical experience and current information 
we believe that the carrying value of merchandise inventory is appropriate as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a difference in our estimate to value inventory at lower of cost or market as of february  would have impacted net income by million for the fiscal year ended february  defined benefit pension plans we maintain a supplemental executive retirement plan  or serp  which is a non qualified defined benefit plan for certain officers 
the plan is non contributory  is not funded and provides benefits based on years of service and compensation during employment 
pension expense is determined using various actuarial cost methods to estimate the total benefits ultimately payable to officers  and this cost is allocated to service periods 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate pension costs are reviewed annually 
we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the serp liability of million is appropriately stated as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
if we had changed the expected discount rate by in  pension expense would have changed by less than  we adopted sfas no 
on february  see the section recent accounting developments in note for a further discussion regarding the impact of adoption 
long lived assets we periodically evaluate the need to recognize impairment losses relating to long lived assets 
long lived assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset may have been impaired 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  store closings  or under performing business trends 
in evaluating an asset for recoverability  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would write the asset down to fair value and we would record an impairment charge  accordingly 
we recorded an asset impairment charge of million during fiscal we believe that the carrying values of finite lived assets  and their useful lives  are appropriate as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 income taxes are recognized for the amount of taxes payable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized differently in the financial statements than for tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established using statutory tax rates and are adjusted for tax rate changes 
we consider accounting for income taxes critical to our operations because management is required to make significant subjective judgments in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances that may be required against deferred tax assets 
we record liabilities for tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated 
tax contingency liabilities are adjusted for changes in circumstances and additional uncertainties  such as significant amendments to existing tax law 
liabilities for tax contingencies were estimated at million as of february  however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements
