overview we are an international provider of integrated business process outsourcing solutions to major brand name companies seeking to maximize their supply chain efficiencies and to extend their traditional business and e commerce initiatives as well as a leading multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise 
we derive our revenues from three business segments business process outsourcing  a master distributor and a discount online retailer 
first  in our business process outsourcing business segment we derive our revenues from a broad range of services  including professional consulting  technology collaboration  order management  managed web hosting and web development  customer relationship management  financial services including billing and collection services and working capital solutions  kitting and assembly services  information management and international fulfillment and distribution services 
we offer our services as an integrated solution  which enables our clients to outsource their complete infrastructure needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies 
our distribution services are conducted at warehouses that we lease or manage and include real time inventory management and customized picking  packing and shipping of our clients customer orders 
we currently offer the ability to provide infrastructure and distribution solutions to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets  including technology manufacturing  computer products  printers  cosmetics  fragile goods  high security collectibles  pharmaceuticals  contemporary home furnishings  apparel  aviation  telecommunications and consumer electronics  among others 

table of contents in this business process outsourcing segment  we do not own the underlying inventory or the resulting accounts receivable  but provide management services for these client owned assets 
we typically charge our service fee revenue on a cost plus basis  a percent of shipped revenue basis or a per transaction basis  such as a per minute basis for web enabled customer contact center services and a per item basis for fulfillment services 
additional fees are billed for other services 
we price our services based on a variety of factors  including the depth and complexity of the services provided  the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required  the length of contract and other factors 
many of our service fee contracts involve third party vendors who provide additional services such as package delivery 
the costs we are charged by these third party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients 
our billings for reimbursements of these and other out of pocket expenses include travel  shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass through revenue 
in our second business segment is a product revenue model 
in this segment  we are a master distributor of product for ibm and certain other clients 
in this capacity  we purchase  and thus own  inventory and recognize the corresponding product revenue 
as a result  upon the sale of inventory  we own the accounts receivable 
freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue 
this business segment requires significant working capital requirements  for which we have senior credit facilities to provide for more than million of available financing 
our third business segment is a web commerce product revenue model focused on the sale of products to a broad range of consumer and small business customers 
in this segment we operate as a multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise 
our product line currently offers approximately  products in several primary merchandise categories  primarily including computer hardware and software  home electronics  digital imaging  watches and jewelry  housewares  dvd movies  video games and cellular wireless 
growth is a key element to us achieving our future goals  including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability 
growth in our business process outsourcing segment is driven by two main elements new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients 
we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand name companies within two primary target markets  which  by nature  require a longer duration to close but also often prove to be higher quality and longer duration engagements 
our results include approximately million of new revenue  including certain incremental projects  which we estimate is approximately of the approximately to million we believe will ultimately be the fully operational annual fee revenue under new client relationships entered into in growth within our product revenue business is primarily driven by our ability to attract new master distributor arrangements with ibm or other manufacturers and the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners 
growth within our web commerce product revenue model is primarily driven by our ability to increase ecost s sales and expand its product line 
we continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability 
while we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield increased gross profit  we also expect to incur incremental investments to implement new contracts  investments in infrastructure and sales and marketing to support our targeted growth and increased public company professional fees 
our expenses comprise primarily four categories cost of product revenue  cost of service fee revenue  cost of pass through revenue and operating expenses 
cost of product revenues consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs  which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses 
these reimbursable expenses include pass through customer marketing programs  direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and 
table of contents certain special bids  the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the master distributor agreements 
vendor marketing programs  such as co op advertising  also reduce cost of product revenue 
cost of service fee revenue consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web enabled customer contact center services  international fulfillment and distribution services and professional consulting services  and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of pass through revenue the related reimbursable costs for pass through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass through revenue 
operating expenses consist primarily of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff  advertising  online marketing and catalog production  distribution costs excluding freight applicable to the supplies distributors and ecost businesses  executive  management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
as a result of the acquisition of ecost in february  and the subsequent valuation of intangible assets acquired in the acquisition  it was determined that the carrying value of the intangibles exceeded their fair value thereby requiring that we write off the excess net book value of approximately million 
monitoring and controlling our available cash balances continues to be a primary focus 
our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth 
in recent years we have added to our available cash and liquidity positions through various transactions 
each of our primary operating subsidiaries has one or more asset based working capital financing agreements with various lenders 
in we completed a private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock to certain investors that provided net proceeds of approximately million 
in january  we issued an additional million shares of common stock to certain of these investors who exercised warrants issued in the private placement 
the warrants exercised provided million of additional proceeds 
in we received proceeds of million of taxable revenue bonds to finance capital additions to our new facility in southaven  ms 
in june  we completed another private placement of million shares of our common stock to certain investors that provided net proceeds of million 
historical financial presentation as a result of our merger with ecost

in addition  the period included certain personnel related costs and certain incremental costs incurred to relocate certain of our operations from memphis  tn to a new facility in southaven  ms  which did not recur in while we do not expect the same level of merger integration expenses to recur in  we do anticipate incremental operating expenses for certain of our facilities and additional expenses in preparation of complying with the section requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of operating expenses also include a goodwill impairment resulting from our annual analysis pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard no

under this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the fair value  which resulted in a million non cash write off of goodwill during the fourth quarter of interest expense  net

net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million  resulting from capital expenditures of million offset by a decrease in restricted cash of million 
capital expenditures have historically consisted primarily of additions to upgrade our management information systems and general expansion of our facilities  both domestic and foreign 
we expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities 
based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans  we anticipate that our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology services for the upcoming twelve months will be approximately million to million  although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients as well as the ecost infrastructure 
to maintain our current operating cash position  a portion of these expenditures may be financed through debt  operating or capital leases or additional equity 
we may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not achieve the revenue necessary to support such investments 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily representing million of net proceeds on issuance of common stock pursuant to a private placement transaction and million of net proceeds on debt partially offset by payments on capital leases of million and an increase in restricted cash of million

our liquidity has been negatively impacted as a result of the merger with ecost 
during and  ecost experienced a significant net usage of cash primarily due to losses incurred 
as a result  during the process of transitioning and integrating the ecost operations  we have had to support ecost s cash needs to help it achieve a stabilized operational position 
the amount of further cash needed to support ecost operations will depend upon the financing available as well as ecost s ability to improve its financial results 
we currently expect that ecost  as part of a combined company  should achieve annual recurring cost savings of approximately million to million  dependent upon sales volumes  as compared to pre merger levels 
these savings result from  among other things  the reduction of certain overhead expenses  changes in corporate infrastructure and reduced freight costs  although there can be no assurance that these cost savings will be achieved 
as we have essentially completed the integration of ecost into our infrastructure  we have begun to realize the benefits of many of these expected cost savings 
additionally we expect improvements in ecost profitability in and beyond as a result of planned efforts to increase sales  improve product mix and improved operational efficiencies 

table of contents during the year ended december   our working capital decreased to million from million at december  primarily as a result of the use of cash related to the integration activities of ecost into the pfs infrastructure as well as cash used to support ecost operating losses 
a portion of these cash outflows were offset by the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a private placement transaction 
to obtain additional financing in the future  in addition to our current cash position  we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity  utilizing capital or operating leases  borrowing under our own credit facilities  expanding our current credit facilities  entering into new debt agreements or transferring to third parties a portion of our subordinated loan balance due from supplies distributors 
in conjunction with certain of these alternatives  we may be required to provide certain letters of credit to secure these arrangements 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof 
we currently believe that our cash position  financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations including our anticipated revenue growth and or cost reductions to offset lower than anticipated revenue growth will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  our lease obligations  and additional loans to our subsidiaries supplies distributors and ecost  if necessary  for at least the next twelve months 
the following is a schedule of our total contractual cash obligations  which is comprised of operating leases  debt  vendor financing and capital leases including interest  as of december  in millions payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations debt and vendor financing capital lease obligations operating leases total in support of certain debt instruments and leases  as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash restricted as collateral for a letter of credit  which expires in as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of cash restricted for payment of capital expenditures or repayment to lenders 
in addition  as described above  we have provided collateralized guarantees to secure the repayment of certain of our subsidiaries credit facilities 
many of these facilities include both financial and non financial covenants  and also include cross default provisions applicable to other credit facilities and agreements 
these covenants include minimum levels of net worth for the individual borrower subsidiaries and restrictions on the ability of the borrower subsidiaries to advance funds to other borrower subsidiaries 
as a result  it is possible for one or more of these borrower subsidiaries to fail to meet their respective covenants even if another borrower subsidiary otherwise has available excess funds which  if not restricted  could be used to cure the default 
to the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants  including the monthly financial covenant requirements and our required level of stockholders equity  and the lenders accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations  we would be required to repay all amounts outstanding thereunder 
in particular  in the event ecost is unable to increase its revenue and or gross profit from its present levels it may fail to comply with one or more of the financial covenants required under its working capital line of credit 
in such event  absent a waiver  the working capital lender would be entitled to accelerate all amounts outstanding thereunder and exercise all other rights and remedies  including sale of collateral and payment under our parent guaranty 
a requirement to accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurance that we will have the financial ability to repay all of such obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
we do not have any other material financial commitments  although future client contracts may require capital expenditures and lease commitments to support the services provided to such clients 
in the future  we may attempt to acquire other businesses or seek an equity or strategic partner to generate capital or expand our services or capabilities in connection with our efforts to grow our business 
acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties and may require additional financing 
therefore  we can give no assurance with respect to whether we will be successful in identifying businesses to acquire or an equity or strategic partner  whether we or they will be able to obtain financing to complete a transaction  or whether we or they will be successful in operating the acquired business

table of contents increase the number of virtual warehouse partnerships for both electronics and non electronic goods  develop higher margin non product and service categories  expand international sales  particularly in europe and canada  where we maintain a presence  and utilize our stronger financial platform to enhance ecost s working capital resources to expand access to exclusive products and deals 
we can provide no assurance that such plans or the underlying financial benefits will be achieved 
additionally  even with such plans  we expect that ecost will operate at a loss during and will require funding to support its operations 
ecost has historically incurred significant operating losses and used cash to fund its operations 
as a result  we have been required to invest cash to fund ecost s operations  which we may not be able to continue to do without approval from our lenders 
the amount of further cash needed to support ecost operations depends upon the financing available under its credit line as well as ecost s ability to improve its financial results 
through march   we have advanced million to ecost to fund ecost s cash flow requirements and have lender approval to advance an additional million  with certain restrictions  if needed 
in the event we need to invest further cash to ecost  we may be required to seek approval from our lenders to provide such funds 
we can provide no assurance that we will receive such approval from our lenders or any terms or conditions required by our lenders to obtain such approval 
in addition  pfsweb has provided a guaranty of ecost s bank line of credit and certain ecost s vendor trade payables 
if ecost is unable to meet its requirements under its debt obligations and bank facility  the guarantees referred to above could be called upon 
we receive municipal tax abatements in certain locations 
during we received notice from a municipal authority that we did not satisfy certain criteria necessary to maintain the abatements 
in december we received notice that the municipal authority planned to make an adjustment to our tax abatement 
we plan to dispute the adjustment  but if the dispute is not resolved favorably  additional taxes of approximately million could be assessed against us through december  we have not accrued for the additional taxes as we do not believe that it is probable that an additional assessment will be incurred 
on may   a lawsuit was filed in the district court of collin county  texas  by j 
gregg pritchard  as trustee of the dic creditors trust  naming the former directors of daisytek international corporation and the company as defendants 
daisytek filed for bankruptcy in may and the trust was created pursuant to daisytek s plan of liquidation 
the complaint alleges  among other things  that the spin off of the company from daisytek in december was a fraudulent conveyance and that daisytek was damaged thereby in the amount of at least million 
the company believes the claim has no merit and intends to vigorously defend the action 
through december   we have incurred outstanding legal costs of approximately million  which have not been paid as we expect such costs to be covered by insurance 
on august   a lawsuit was filed in the chancery court of davidson county  tennessee  by clientlogic corp 
alleging  among other things  that we breached our obligations under a confidentiality and nondisclosure agreement 
the complaint sought injunctive relief and damages in an unspecified amount 
in january the lawsuit was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice 
on july   we received correspondence from mercexchange llc alleging infringement of mercexchange s us patents relating to e commerce and offering to license its patent portfolio to ecost 
on july   we received a follow up letter from mercexchange specifying which of its technologies mercexchange believed infringed certain of its patents  alone or in combination with technologies provided by third parties 
some of those patents are currently being litigated by third parties  and we are not involved in those proceedings 
in addition  three of the four patents identified by mercexchange are under reexamination at the us patent and trademark office  which may or may not result in the modification of those claims 
in the july letter  mercexchange also advised ecost that it has a number of applications pending for additional patents 
mercexchange has filed lawsuits alleging infringement of some or all of its patents against third parties  resulting in settlements or verdicts in favor of mercexchange 
at least one such verdict was appealed to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit and was affirmed in part 
based on our investigation of 
table of contents this matter to date  we believe that our current ecost operations do not infringe any valid claims of the patents identified by mercexchange in these letters 
there can be no assurance  however  that such claims will not be material or adversely affect our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
inventory management we manage our inventories held for sale by maintaining sufficient quantities of product to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time maximizing inventory turnover rates 
inventory balances will fluctuate as we add new product lines 
to reduce the risk of loss due to supplier price reductions  our master distributor agreement  as well as certain vendor agreement in our ecost business  provide for price protection under which we receive credits if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory 
seasonality the seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients business and sales of their products 
accordingly  our management must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability 
we believe that with our current client mix and their current business volumes  our service fee business activity will be at its lowest in the quarter ended march we anticipate that our supplies distributors product revenue will be highest during the quarter ended december our ecost business is moderately seasonal  reflecting the general pattern of peak sales for the retail industry during the holiday shopping season 
typically  a larger portion of our ecost revenues occur during the first and fourth fiscal quarters 
we believe that our historical revenue growth makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations we believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the derecognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  any differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it would likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we 
table of contents base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below  unless otherwise noted 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 
product revenue recognition we adhere to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  issued as a revision to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
while the wording of sab has revised the original sab  the revenue recognition principles of sab remain largely unchanged by the issuance of sab under sab  sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under these guidelines  we recognize a majority of our sales  including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges  upon receipt of the product by the customer 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  we are the primary obligor in the transaction  and we take title to the products sold upon shipment  bear credit risk  and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  therefore  we recognize these revenues at gross sales amounts 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances  credit card fraud and chargebacks  all of which are estimated based upon recent historical information such as return and redemption rates  and fraud and chargeback experience 
management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates 
if actual sales returns  allowances  discounts and credit card fraud and chargebacks are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
cost of service fee revenue our service fee revenues primarily relate to our distribution services and order management customer care services 
distribution services relate primarily to inventory management  product receiving  warehousing and fulfillment ie  picking  packing and shipping 
order management customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our client s products via various channels such as telephone call center  electronic or facsimile 
these services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders  as well as cross selling up selling activities 
our cost of service fee revenue represents the cost to provide the services described above  primarily compensation and related expenses and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing the services 
these include certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
certain of these costs are allocated from general and administrative expenses 
for these allocations  we estimate the amount of direct expenses based on a client specific number of transactions processed 
we believe our allocation methodology is reasonable  however a change in assumptions would result in a different gross profit in our statement of operations  yet no change to the resulting net income or loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectibility of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectibility is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the 
table of contents overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate 
inherently  these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
with our online discount retail business  we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables  which arise from vendor rebate programs  price protections and other promotions 
we determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors  including payment history 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non compliance with certain elements of vendor programs 
if our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient  additional allowance maybe required 
allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
inventory reserves inventories merchandise  held for resale  all of which are finished goods are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
supplies distributors and its subsidiaries assume responsibility for slow moving inventory under certain master distributor agreements  subject to certain termination rights  but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes  as defined 
ecost assumes responsibility for slow moving inventory but has limited rights to return product based on specific inventory agreements 
we review inventory for impairment on a periodic basis  but at a minimum  annually 
recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparison of the carrying value of the inventory to the fair value of the inventory 
this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
to determine these reserve amounts  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions 
these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes 
at december  and  our allowance for slow moving inventory totaled million and million  respectively 
we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions 
significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of the certain of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ  which could be material 
as we operate in multiple countries  we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 

table of contents long lived assets long lived assets include property  intangible assets  goodwill and certain other assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  we review long lived assets for impairment periodically  but at a minimum annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses in the period in which we determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this may require us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of the goodwill resulting from our acquisition of ecost was impaired  which resulting in a million non cash write off of goodwill 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including interest rates on our financial instruments and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk is limited to our outstanding balances on our inventory and working capital financing agreements  taxable revenue bonds  loan and security agreements  and factoring agreement for the financing of inventory  accounts receivable and certain other receivables and certain equipment  which amounted to million at december  a basis point movement in interest rates would result in approximately million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense based on the outstanding balance of these agreements at december  foreign exchange risk currently  our foreign currency exchange rate risk is primarily limited to the canadian dollar and the euro 
in the future  our foreign currency exchange risk may also include other currencies applicable to certain of our international operations 
we have and may continue  from time to time  to employ derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
to hedge our net investment and intercompany payable or receivable balances in foreign operations  we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts
