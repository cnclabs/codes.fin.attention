item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on rna interference  or rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and regulating specific genes 
since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific genes  the ability to silence genes selectively through rnai could provide a new way to treat a wide range of human diseases 
we believe that drugs that work through rnai have the potential to become a new major class of drugs  like small molecule  protein and antibody drugs 
using our intellectual property and the expertise we have built in rnai  we are developing a set of biological and chemical methods and know how that we expect to apply in a systematic way to develop rnai therapeutics for a variety of diseases 
we are building a pipeline of rnai therapeutics 
our lead program is in phase i clinical trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  infection  which we believe is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants in the united states and occurs in the elderly and in immune compromised adults 
in pre clinical development programs  we are also working on another respiratory infection  influenza  with novartis and an rnai therapeutic targeting a gene called pcsk for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia 
we have pre clinical discovery programs focused on central nervous system  or cns  diseases including parkinson s disease  huntington s disease  neuropathic pain  spinal cord injury and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy  or pml  a cns disease caused by viral infection in immune compromised patients 
we also have a program to treat the inherited respiratory disease known as cystic fibrosis  or cf  as well as a program for ebola virus infection 
we are also working to extend our capabilities to enable the development of rnai therapeutics that travel through the bloodstream to reach diseased parts of the body  which we refer to as systemic rnai tm  and are developing technology to achieve efficient and safe systemic delivery 
in addition  we have formed alliances with leading companies  including novartis  merck  biogen idec and medtronic 
we commenced operations in june we have focused our efforts since inception primarily on business planning  research and development  acquiring intellectual property rights  recruiting management and technical staff  and raising capital 
since our inception  we have generated significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
through december   we have funded our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sale of equity securities 
through december   a substantial portion of our total net revenues have been collaboration revenue derived from our strategic alliances with novartis and merck 
we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from strategic alliances  such as our collaborations with novartis  merck and biogen idec  government and foundation funding and license fee revenues 
we currently have programs focused in a number of therapeutic areas  however  we are unable to predict when  if ever  we will be able to commence sales of any product 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and we expect to incur significant additional losses over the next several years 
we expect our net losses to increase primarily due to research and development activities relating to our collaborations  drug development programs and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
therefore  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
our sources of potential funding for the next several years are expected to include proceeds from the sale of equity  license and other fees  funded research and development payments  proceeds from equipment lines of credit and milestone payments under existing and future collaborative arrangements 
research and development since our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs 
research and development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses 
we have initiated programs to identify specific rnai therapeutics that will be administered directly to diseased parts of the body  which we refer to as direct rnai therapeutics  and we expect to initiate additional programs as the capabilities of our product platform evolve 
included in our current programs are development programs  those programs for which we have 
table of contents established targeted timing for human clinical trials  and discovery programs  those programs for which we have yet to establish programs for targeted timing for human clinical trials 
our most advanced development program is focused on rsv 
in november  we filed an ind related to our rsv program and initiated human clinical trials of aln rsv in december our other development programs are focused on another lung infection  influenza  or flu and on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia 
we also have discovery programs to develop direct rnai therapeutics for the treatment of the genetic respiratory disease cf  central nervous system disorders such as spinal cord injury  parkinson s disease  huntington s disease  neuropathic pain  viral disease such as ebola  pml and several other diseases that are the subject of collaborations with merck and novartis 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including rnai 
the successful development of any product candidate we develop is highly uncertain 
due to the numerous risks associated with developing drugs  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  any potential product candidate 
these risks include the uncertainty of our ability to progress any product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of any potential products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and the potential consequences of failing to do so  are set forth in item a above under the heading risk factors 
strategic alliances a significant component of our business strategy is to enter into strategic alliances and collaborations with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  research foundations and others  as appropriate  to gain access to funding  technical resources and intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues 
we have entered into license agreements with max planck innovation and isis  as well as a number of other entities  to obtain rights to important intellectual property in the field of rnai 
we have entered into collaborations with novartis to discover and develop therapeutics based on rnai and to develop an rnai therapeutic for pandemic flu  merck to develop rnai technology and therapeutics  medtronic to develop novel drug device products incorporating rnai therapeutics to treat diseases caused by degeneration of the nervous system and biogen idec to perform investigative research into the potential of using rnai technology to discover and develop therapeutics to treat pml 
we have also entered into contracts with government agencies  such as the niaid 
in addition  we have entered into an agreement with cfft to obtain funding and technical resources for our cf program 
novartis 
we have formed two alliances with novartis 
we refer to the first of these  which was initiated in september  as the broad novartis alliance  and to the second  which was initiated in february  as the 
table of contents novartis flu alliance 
in october  novartis purchased approximately million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  which  immediately after such issuance  represented of our then outstanding common stock 
novartis owned approximately of our common stock as of december  under the terms of the collaboration and license agreement  the parties agreed to work together on selected targets  as defined in the collaboration and license agreement  to discover and develop therapeutics based on rnai 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an upfront payment of million to us in october  partly to reimburse prior costs incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
in addition  the collaboration and license agreement includes terms under which novartis agreed to provide us with research funding and milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration 
the collaboration and license agreement also provides novartis with a non exclusive option to integrate our intellectual property relating to rnai technology into novartis operations under specified circumstances 
in connection with the exercise of the integration option  novartis will be required to make additional payments to us 
in february  we entered into the novartis flu alliance 
the agreement governing the flu alliance is structured as an addendum to the collaboration and license agreement for the broad novartis alliance 
we are eligible to receive significant funding from novartis for our efforts on rnai therapeutics for pandemic flu  and to receive a significant share of any profits 
merck 
in july  we amended and restated our research collaboration and license agreement with merck  from september  as amended 
our collaboration with merck is focused on developing rnai therapeutics for targets associated with human diseases and  under the terms of the amended and restated license agreement  will focus on the nine targets that then remained to be nominated by merck under the terms of the original license agreement 
these nine programs are in addition to the existing program directed to the nogo pathway on which we were already collaborating with merck under the original agreement 
we may select three of the nine additional programs as joint development programs  which merck will co fund and participate in from the outset 
in october  we selected a co development program from the first three targets presented by merck under the amended and restated license agreement 
under the original license agreement  the collaboration was structured such that co funding by merck would not begin until after the completion of defined pre clinical work 
the amended and restated license agreement provides funding from merck immediately for programs selected by us for co development  and provides that  in the united states  we will have the right to co promote rnai therapeutic products developed in these three co development programs 
merck will assume primary responsibility for the remaining six programs and we are eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on any rnai therapeutic products developed and commercialized by merck in these six programs 
also in july  we and merck agreed to terminate our collaboration and license agreement  effective as of june   pursuant to which we were collaborating in the research  development and commercialization of rnai products directed to certain targets  including but not limited to  vascular endothelial growth factor or vegf 
medtronic 
in february  we entered into a collaboration with medtronic to pursue the potential development of therapeutic products for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinson s  huntington s and alzheimer s disease 
the collaboration is focused on developing novel drug device combinations incorporating rnai therapeutic products 
currently  we are engaged in a joint technology development program with medtronic through april this initial joint technology development program is focused on delivering candidate rnai therapeutic products to specific areas of the brain using implantable infusion systems 
after successful completion of the initial joint technology development program  the parties must jointly determine whether to initiate product development 
if we make a joint decision to initiate product development  medtronic would make an initial equity investment in us and could make additional investments upon successful completion of specified milestones 
the aggregate amount of our common stock that medtronic would purchase  if a joint decision were made to initiate product development and the specified milestones were successfully 
table of contents completed  would be million 
the amount of the investment to be made at the time of the joint decision to initiate product development would be between million and million  as determined by us  at the then current market price 
for the purpose of this investment  the then current market price would be equal to the twenty day trailing average of the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market at the end of the trading day two trading days prior to the date of the decision to initiate product development 
the remaining investments of between million and million would be made upon the achievement of the specified milestones at a purchase price equal to of the then current market price  calculated in the same manner as described above 
if either party decides not to initiate product development under the collaboration agreement  medtronic would not be required to make any equity investment in us 
we would also be eligible to receive additional cash milestone payments for each product developed and royalties on sales of any rnai therapeutic component of novel drug device combinations that result from the collaboration 
biogen idec 
in september  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with biogen idec focused on the discovery and development of therapeutics based on rnai for the potential treatment of pml 
under the terms of the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we granted an exclusive license to distribute  market and sell certain rnai therapeutics to treat pml and biogen idec has agreed to fund all related research and development activities 
we also received an upfront million payment from biogen idec 
in addition  upon the successful development and utilization of a product resulting from the collaboration  biogen idec would be required to pay us milestone and royalty payments 
nih 
in september  we were awarded a contract to advance the development of a broad spectrum rnai anti viral therapeutic against hemorrhagic fever virus  including the ebola virus  with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases  or niaid  a component of the national institutes of health  or nih 
the federal contract will provide us with up to million in funding over a four year period to develop  as anti viral drugs targeting the ebola virus 
the ebola virus can cause a severe  often fatal infection  and poses a potential biological safety risk and bioterrorism threat 
of the million  the government has committed to pay us million over the first two years of the contract and  subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations in future years  the remaining million over the last two years of the contract 
isis 
in march  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with isis  a leading developer of single stranded antisense oligonucleotide drugs that target rna 
the agreement enhanced our intellectual property position with respect to rna based therapeutic products and our ability to develop double stranded rna for rnai therapeutic products  and provided us with the opportunity to defer investment in manufacturing technology 
under the terms of our agreement  we agreed to pay isis an upfront license fee of million  million of which was paid upon signing of the agreement and the remaining million of which was paid in january we also agreed to pay milestone payments  payable upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties to isis for each product that we or a collaborator develop utilizing isis intellectual property 
in addition  we agreed to pay to isis a percentage of specified fees from strategic collaborations we may enter into that include access to the isis intellectual property 
in conjunction with the agreement  isis made a million equity investment in us 
isis also agreed to pay us a license fee  milestone payments  payable upon the occurrence of specified development and regulatory events  and royalties for each product developed by isis or a collaborator that utilizes our intellectual property 
the agreement also gives us an option to use isis manufacturing services for rna based therapeutic products 
our agreement with isis also gives us the exclusive right to grant sub licenses for isis technology to third parties with whom we are not collaborating 
we may include these sub licenses in our interferx licenses 
if a license includes rights to isis intellectual property  we will share revenues from that license equally with isis 
if  by january   we or a collaborator have not completed the studies required for an ind submission or similar foreign filing for at least one product candidate involving these patent rights  isis would have the right to grant licenses to third parties for the patents and patent applications licensed to us  thereby making our rights non exclusive 
inex 
in january  inex granted us an exclusive license to its liposomal delivery formulation technology for the discovery  development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics 
we granted inex an option for three interferx tm licenses  subject to our review and third party obligations  to develop their own rnai therapeutic 
table of contents products and exclusive access to our intellectual property to develop oligonucleotide drugs that do not function through an rnai mechanism 
in connection with inex s license grant to us  we issued inex  shares of our common stock  valued at million  in a private placement on january  and on february   we paid them an additional million 
we have also agreed to make available to inex a million loan for capital equipment expenditures related to manufacturing services performed by inex for us 
in addition  we will be required to pay inex up to million in milestone payments for each product we develop utilizing technology inex has licensed to us 
critical accounting policies and estimates while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our consolidated financial statements use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and accrued expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could have a material impact on our reported results 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues from our collaboration agreements with merck and novartis may include nonrefundable license fees  milestones  cost reimbursements research and development funding and royalties 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf application of these standards requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the value of the individual elements and whether it is separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
to date  we have determined that our upfront non refundable license fees cannot be separated from our ongoing collaborative activities  and accordingly  do not treat them as a separate element 
nonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue as we perform under the collaboration agreement 
where our level of effort is relatively constant over the performance period  we recognize revenues on a straight line basis over the estimated period of performance under the contract  unless evidence suggests that revenue is earned in a different pattern  in which case that pattern is followed 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payments are nonrefundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if 
table of contents any of these conditions are not met  we defer the milestone payments and recognize them as revenue over the term of the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
novartis 
in consideration for rights granted to novartis under the collaboration and license agreement  novartis made an up front payment of million to us in october to partly reimburse costs previously incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
in addition  the collaboration and license agreement includes terms under which novartis agreed to provide us with research funding and milestone payments as well as royalties on annual net sales of products resulting from the collaboration and license agreement 
we initially recorded as deferred revenue the non refundable million up front payment and million premium that represents the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of our common stock on the date of the stock purchase from novartis 
in addition to these payments  research funding and certain milestone payments will be amortized into revenue using the proportional performance method over the estimated duration of the novartis agreement or ten years 
under this method  we estimate the level of effort to be expended over the term of the agreement and recognize revenue based on the lesser of the amount calculated based on the proportional performance of total expected revenue or the amount of non refundable payments earned 
we believe the estimated term of the novartis agreement includes the three year term of the agreement  two one year extensions at the election of novartis and limited support as part of a technology transfer until the fifth anniversary of the termination of the agreement 
therefore  an expected term of ten years is used in the proportional performance model 
we will evaluate the expected term when new information is known that could affect our estimate 
in the event our period of involvement is different than we estimated  revenue recognition will be adjusted on a prospective basis 
merck 
we recognize revenues from reimbursable research and development activities at the time these activities are performed under the terms of the related agreement  when the collaborator is obligated to pay and when no future performance obligations exist 
in revenue arrangements where both parties reimburse each other for research costs  such as our prior collaboration agreement with merck for the co development of rnai therapeutics for the treatment of ocular diseases  in which both parties reimbursed each other for of the costs incurred  as defined by the agreement  we followed eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  or eitf  in determining the proper accounting for amounts owed to merck in reimbursement for our portion of merck s costs under the agreement 
in accordance with eitf  we recorded revenues equal to the amount we were due to receive for costs incurred under the agreement less amounts reimbursable to the other party during the same accounting period unless we received a separable and identifiable benefit in exchange for the payments made to the other party under the arrangement and we could reasonably estimate the fair value of the benefit received 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  stock based compensation expense is recognized beginning in for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and compensation cost for all stock based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
such amounts are reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
prior to january   we accounted for employee stock awards granted under our compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and related interpretations 
under apb  when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
all stock based awards granted to non employees are accounted for at their fair value in 
table of contents accordance with sfas  as amended  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  or eitf  under which compensation expense is generally recognized over the vesting period of the award 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of fair values of stock options as of the grant date 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on a combination of implied volatilities of similar entities whose share or option prices are publicly available as well as the historical volatility of our publicly traded stock 
for stock option grants issued during the year ended december   we used a weighted average expected stock price volatility assumption of 
due to our short history of being a public company  we estimated the expected life of option grants made during the year ended december  using the simplified method prescribed under staff accounting bulletin no 
since the grants qualify as plain vanilla options  which averages the contractual term of the stock options years with the vesting term years for an average of years for most stock options 
the dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life 
as of december   the estimated fair value of unvested employee awards was million  net of estimated forfeitures 
this amount will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting period of approximately years for these awards 
stock based employee compensation was million for the year ended december  however  the total amount of stock compensation expense recognized in any future period cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of stock based payments granted in the future as well as the portion of the awards that actually vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
we currently expect  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  that approximately of our options will actually vest  and therefore have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested options as of december  ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest

table of contents discussion of results of operations for and the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  novartis other research collaborators interferx program and research reagent licenses other total net revenues novartis 
the increase in revenues relates to a full year of activity for our main collaboration with novartis compared to only one quarter of activity during in addition  the increase also resulted from our february alliance with novartis for the development of rnai therapeutics for pandemic flu which provides for the reimbursement of research costs incurred under this agreement as well as a share of any future profits 
other research collaborators 
other research collaborators revenues consist of revenues from biogen idec  merck  the nih and other government and foundation revenues 
the decrease in revenues from other research collaborators was related to a million decrease in revenues primarily related to our merck ocular disease collaboration  for which development was suspended in september based on portfolio management and commercial factors 
the decrease in other research collaborator revenues was partially offset by nih revenues as well as biogen idec revenues during  which consisted of research and development funding and amortization revenues of the million up front payment 
interferx 
in addition to our collaboration agreements  we have an interferx program under which we have licensed our intellectual property to others for the development and commercialization of rnai therapeutics in narrowly defined therapeutic areas in which we are not currently engaged 
we have also granted licenses to our intellectual property to others for the development and commercialization of research reagents and services 
we expect these programs to provide revenues from license fees and royalties on sales by the licensees  subject to limitations under our agreements with novartis 
the increase in interferx revenues and research reagent licenses revenue was due primarily to million payment from quark during deferred revenue 
total deferred revenue of million at december  consists of payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license agreements that we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy 
for the foreseeable future  we expect our revenues to continue to be derived primarily from strategic alliances  collaborations and licensing activities

as indicated in the table above  the increase in research and development expenses in as compared to the previous year was primarily due to clinical trial and manufacturing related expenses in support of our rsv clinical program  which began in december the increase in compensation related expenses and lab supplies and materials expenses was due to additional research and development headcount over the past year to support our alliances and expanding product pipeline 
the increase in stock based compensation for the year ended december  was primarily due to our adoption of sfas r on january  we expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development expenses and that research and development expenses will increase as we continue development of our and our collaborators product candidates and technologies 
we do not track most of our research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a project by project basis  because all of our programs are in the early stages of development 
however  our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements whereby certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed 
costs reimbursed under the agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full time equivalent labor rate for the actual time worked on the project 
as a result  although a significant portion of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project by project basis  we do track direct external costs attributable to  and the actual time our employees worked on  our collaborations

discussion of results of operations for and net revenues from research collaborators the following table summarizes our total consolidated net revenues for the periods indicated  in thousands year ended december  merck cfft novartis interferx other total net revenues merck 
under our september collaboration and license agreement with merck  we have received upfront and license payments which have been deferred and are being recognized as revenue over six years  the estimated period of performance under this agreement 
in september  we received a million payment and  in both september and september  we received additional payments of million 
we recognized revenues of million and million from the amortization of these payments in and in december  we achieved a scientific milestone  as defined by this agreement  resulting in a million milestone payment from merck 
in connection with the achievement of this scientific milestone  merck made a million equity investment in our common stock 
the purchase price of this common stock  as defined by the agreement  was determined based on the average trading price of our common stock during the twenty days prior to 
table of contents the purchase  which was 
the price of our common stock on the date of the purchase was and resulted in an actual value of million for the common stock issued to merck 
as a result  we recorded a reduction of million to the revenue recorded from merck during under the terms of our agreement with merck relating to ocular targets  in we received a million license fee  as well as million representing reimbursement of prior research and development costs  which we incurred on our pre existing ocular disease program 
prior to the termination of this agreement in july  these amounts were being amortized into revenues over the then estimated period of performance under the collaboration agreement of eight years 
as such  we recorded revenues of million in and million in from the amortization of these payments 
in addition to upfront and milestone payments  this agreement provided for the sharing of research costs incurred under this agreement 
we recorded net revenues of million in and million in from these cost sharing activities 
cfft 
under the collaboration agreement we entered into with cfft in march  cfft provided us with an initial payment of million and a milestone payment of million  which we recorded as revenue 
novartis 
under our october collaboration and license agreement with novartis  we received an upfront payment totaling million in consideration for rights granted to novartis under our collaboration and to partly reimburse costs previously incurred by us to develop in vivo rnai technology 
in addition  in october  novartis purchased approximately million shares at a purchase price of per share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the closing price of our common stock on the date of purchase was 
we recorded the difference between the purchase price and the closing price of million as deferred revenue 
we recognized revenues of million under our novartis collaboration during interferx licenses 
in  we began licensing our intellectual property to others under our interferx program 
under existing programs  we recognized revenues of million in deferred revenue 
deferred revenue of million at december  represents payments received from our collaborators pursuant to our license agreements with them which we have yet to earn pursuant to our revenue recognition policy

all of our investments in debt securities are recorded at fair value and are available for sale 
fair value is determined based on quoted market prices 
operating activities we have required significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities as a result of net losses since our inception 
this trend continued in as our use of cash in our operating activities increased as compared to the year ended december  the main components of our use of cash in operating activities are the net loss and changes in our operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in operating activities is adjusted for non cash items to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities 
these non cash adjustments primarily consist of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization 
non cash stock based compensation increased due primarily to our adoption of sfas r on january  as well as to a lesser extent the increase of the fair value of non employee stock options

these increases were offset by a net accounts receivable increase of million and amortization of deferred revenue of million for the year ended december  our cash utilization is expected to continue throughout and thereafter as we continue to develop and advance our research and development initiatives 
the actual amount of overall expenditures will depend on numerous factors  including the timing of expenses  the timing and terms of collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  if any  and the timing and progress of our research and development efforts

for the year ended december   net cash provided by investing activities resulted from net sales of marketable securities of approximately million  partially offset by purchases of property and equipment of approximately million 
financing activities since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
through  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of redeemable convertible preferred stock and approximately million from the sale of common stock  including million from the sale of million shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  which was completed in june  million from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock to novartis  which was completed in october  and million of net proceeds from our follow on public offerings in january and december in addition to sales of equity securities  we have financed a portion of our property and equipment purchases through the establishment of equipment lines of credit 
in march  we entered into an agreement with oxford finance corporation to establish an equipment line of credit for up to million to help support capital expansion of our facility in cambridge  massachusetts and capital equipment purchases 
during  we borrowed an aggregate of million from oxford pursuant to the agreement 
of such amount  million bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to and is being repaid in monthly installments of principal and interest 
the remainder of such amount  approximately million  bears interest at fixed rates ranging from to and is being repaid in monthly installments of principal and interest 
in march  we entered into an equipment line of credit with lighthouse capital partners to finance leasehold improvements and equipment purchases of up to million

this amount is being accrued over the applicable borrowing period as additional interest expense 
at december   we had an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million under all of our loan agreements 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that our existing resources  together with the cash we expect to generate under our collaborations  will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next several years  during which time we expect to extend the capabilities of our technology platform  further the development of our products  conduct clinical trials and continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent portfolio 
however  we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in order to develop  and commence clinical trials for  any product candidates 
we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private financings 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our stockholders 
for example  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
if we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development programs 
we also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise pursue 

table of contents even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner  our future capital requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors  including the following our progress in demonstrating that sirnas can be active as drugs  our ability to develop relatively standard procedures for selecting and modifying sirna drug candidates  progress in our research and development programs  as well as the magnitude of these programs  the timing  receipt  and amount of milestone and other payments  if any  from present and future collaborators  if any  our ability to establish and maintain additional collaborative arrangements  the resources  time and costs required to successfully initiate and complete our pre clinical and clinical trials  obtain regulatory approvals  protect our intellectual property and obtain and maintain licenses to third party intellectual property  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  and enforcing patent claims  and the timing  receipt and amount of sales and royalties  if any  from our potential products

recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid instruments  or sfas  which is an amendment to sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas allows financial instruments which have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the instrument as a whole instrument on a fair value basis 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires a company to recognize  in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis solely on the technical merit of the position 
in addition  fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures including a discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next months as well as a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we intend to adopt fin beginning january and are currently evaluating the impact fin might have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to do so for recognition or disclosure purposes 
the standard provides a common definition of fair value and is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable as well as improving disclosures about those measures 
the standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after november  this standard formalizes the measurement principles to be utilized in determining fair value for purposes such as derivative valuation and impairment analysis 
we are still evaluating the implications of sfas  but do not currently expect it to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas fas no 

the new statement allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of our investment portfolio  we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
our marketable securities consist of us government obligations  corporate debt and commercial paper 
all of our investments in debt securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a decrease in market interest rates at december  would impact the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our european operations are based in kulmbach  germany and the functional currency of these operations is the euro 
we provide funding to our european 
table of contents operations to pay for obligations denominated in euros 
the effect that fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar have on the amounts payable to fund our european operations are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations as other income or expense 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange hedge contracts 
assuming the amount of expenditures by our european operations were consistent with and the timing of the funding of these operations were to remain consistent during the remainder of  a constant increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the euro and the united states dollar during the remainder of of would result in a foreign exchange gain or loss of approximately million
