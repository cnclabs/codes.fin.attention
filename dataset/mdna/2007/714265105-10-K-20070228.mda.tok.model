we offer our customers integrated solutions designed around their specific business objectives  chosen from a breadth of services  including technology infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
with this approach  our customers benefit from integrated service offerings that help synchronize their strategy  systems  and infrastructure 
as a result  we help our customers achieve their business objectives  whether those objectives are to accelerate growth  streamline operations  or enhance customer service capabilities 
our services our customers may contract with us for any one or more of the following categories of services infrastructure services consulting services applications services business process services infrastructure services infrastructure services are typically performed under multi year contracts in which we assume operational responsibility for various aspects of our customers businesses  including data center and systems management  web hosting and internet access  desktop solutions  messaging services  program management  hardware maintenance and monitoring  network management  including vpn services  service desk capabilities  physical security  network security  and risk management 
we typically hire a significant portion of the customer s staff that have supported these functions 
we then apply our expertise and operating methodologies to increase the efficiency of the operations  which usually results in increased operational quality at a lower cost 
consulting services consulting services include strategy consulting  enterprise consulting  technology consulting  and research 
the consulting services provided to customers within our industry solutions and government services segments typically consist of customized  industry specific business solutions provided by associates with industry expertise 
the consulting services provided within the consulting and application solutions segment includes the implementation of prepackaged software applications 
consulting services are typically viewed as discretionary services by our customers  with the level of business activity depending on many factors  including economic conditions and specific customer needs 
applications services applications services include services such as application development and maintenance  including the development and maintenance of custom and packaged application software for customers  and application systems migration and testing  which includes the migration of applications from legacy environments to current technologies  as well as performing quality assurance functions on custom applications 
we also provide other applications services such as application assessment and evaluation  hardware and architecture consulting  systems integration  and web based services

table of contents improve the collection of receivables 
in addition  business process services include engineering support and other technical and administrative services that we provide to the us federal government 
our contracts our contracts include services priced using a wide variety of pricing mechanisms 
in determining how to price our services  we consider the delivery  credit and pricing risk of a business relationship 
for the year ended december  approximately of our revenue was from fixed price contracts where our customers pay us a set amount for contracted services 
for some of these fixed price contracts  the price will be set so that the customer realizes immediate savings in relation to their current expense for the services we will be performing 
on contracts of this nature  our profitability generally increases over the term of the contract as we become more efficient 
the time that it takes for us to realize these efficiencies can range from a few months to a few years  depending on the complexity of the services 
approximately of our revenue was from time and materials contracts where our billings are based on measurements such as hours  days or months and an agreed upon rate 
in some cases  the rate the customer pays for a unit of time can vary over the term of a contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
approximately of our revenue was from cost plus contracts where our billings are based in part on the amount of expense we incur in providing services to a customer 
our largest cost plus contract was with our infrastructure outsourcing contract ubs ag  which was also our largest customer through december  as discussed below under our ubs relationship  our infrastructure outsourcing contract with ubs ended on january   and the services we performed for ubs under that contract represented of our revenue for approximately of our revenue was from per unit pricing where we bill our customers based on the volumes of units provided at the unit rate specified 
in some contracts  the per unit prices may vary over the term of the contract  which may result in the customer realizing immediate savings at the beginning of a contract 
we also utilize other pricing mechanisms  including license fees and risk reward relationships where we participate in the benefit associated with delivering a certain outcome 
revenue from these other pricing mechanisms totaled less than of our revenue 
depending on a customer s business requirements and the pricing structure of the contract  the amount of cash generated from a contract can vary significantly during a contract s term 
with fixed or unit priced contracts or when an upfront payment is made to purchase assets or as a sales incentive  an outsourcing services contract will typically produce less cash at the beginning of the contract with significantly more cash being generated as efficiencies are realized later in the term 
with a cost plus contract  the amount of cash generated tends to be relatively consistent over the term of the contract 
our lines of business we offer our services under three primary lines of business industry solutions  government services  and consulting and applications solutions 
industry solutions  our largest line of business  provides services to our customers primarily under long term contracts in strategic relationships 
these services include technology and business process services  as well as industry domain based  short term project and consulting services 
government services provides consulting  engineering  and technology based business process solutions for the department of defense  the department of homeland security  various federal intelligence agencies  and other governmental agencies 
in the first quarter of  we combined the consulting solutions group  which was previously included in our commercial solutions group in the industry solutions line of business  with the applications solutions line of business 
this combined line of business  consulting and applications solutions  provides software related services  including the implementation of prepackaged software applications  application development and maintenance  and application systems migration and testing  primarily under short term contracts related to specific projects 

table of contents results of operations overview of our financial results for our financial results are affected by a number of factors  including broad economic conditions  the amount and type of technology spending by our customers  and the business strategies and financial condition of our customers and the industries we serve  which could result in increases or decreases in the amount of services that we provide to our customers and the pricing of such services 
our ability to identify and effectively respond to these factors is important to our future financial growth 
we evaluate our consolidated performance on the basis of several performance indicators 
the four key performance indicators we use are revenue growth  earnings growth  free cash flow  and the value of contracts signed 
we compare these key performance indicators to both annual target amounts established by management and to our performance for prior periods 
we establish the targets for these key performance indicators primarily on an annual basis  but we may revise them during the year 
we assess our performance using these key indicators on a quarterly and annual basis 
modification of customer contracts during september  we modified an existing contract that included both construction services and non construction services 
the construction services related to a software development and implementation project  which was modified to eliminate the fixed price development and implementation deliverables in the original contract 
under the original contract  we determined that we could not recognize revenue on the software development and implementation project separately from the non construction services based on the guidance of aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
as a result  we were deferring both the revenue on the software development and implementation project  consisting of the amounts we were billing for those services  and the related costs  up to the relative fair value of the software development and implementation project 
at december   we had deferred million of costs related to the software development and implementation project 
following the contract modification in september  we impaired million of the deferred costs and recorded this charge to direct cost of services in the consolidated income statements 
the remaining deferred costs represent the relative fair value of the software delivered under the modified contract 
prior to the contract modification  we had deferred approximately million of revenue under the original contract terms  which represents fees collected in advance of the software implementation  and was included in non current deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheet 
under the terms of the modified contract  we signed a promissory note to pay the customer million over four years and we have recorded the present value of this note of million as of september   as a reduction of deferred revenue 
we will amortize the remaining million of deferred costs and million of deferred revenue over the term of the modified contract of approximately seven years 
during the years ended december  and  we incurred losses of million and million  respectively  on a contract with a customer in our commercial solutions group 
the loss incurred in included a million charge for the impairment of certain deferred contract costs 
in october  we reached an amicable agreement with this client  resolving our disputes over the scope  service levels and fees under an infrastructure services contract 
under the terms of the modified contract  we will continue to provide services and expect the contract to generate positive gross profits in the aggregate over the remaining contract term 
due to ongoing transition activities  we expect to continue to incur operating losses on this contract through revenue growth revenue growth is a measure of the growth we generate through sales of services to new customers  retention of existing contracts  acquisitions  and discretionary services from existing customers 
revenue for grew by as compared to as discussed in more detail below  this revenue growth came primarily from the following a net increase in revenue from the expansion of base services and discretionary technology investments by our existing long term customers 

table of contents revenue from new contracts signed during and from new contracts signed in for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in revenue from a company acquired in and a company acquired during the third quarter of for which we did not recognize a full year of revenue in earnings growth we measure earnings growth using diluted earnings per share  which is a measure of our effectiveness in delivering profitable growth 
diluted earnings per share for decreased to per share from per share for this decrease came primarily from as discussed above in modification of customer contracts  during the third quarter of  we modified a customer contract and recorded million of expense in direct cost of services  or approximately per diluted share  associated with the impairment of deferred software development and implementation costs 
as discussed above in modification of customer contracts  during  we incurred million in losses on an infrastructure services contract with a commercial solutions customer  which compares to million in losses during the increase in losses from this contract results in a decrease in gross profit of million  or approximately per diluted share 
effective january   we adopted fas r  share based payment  which requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which was allowed under the original provisions of fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
as a result  during  we recorded additional stock compensation expense of million million net of tax as compared to  which reduced our earnings by approximately per diluted share 
of this additional stock compensation expense  million was recorded in direct cost of services and million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these decreases in earnings were improvements in operating profits on a modified customer contract  a company acquired  and new contracts signed in in addition  a decrease in our effective tax rate for the year ended december   to as compared to an effective tax rate for the year ended december   of  resulted in a benefit of approximately per diluted share 
free cash flow we calculate free cash flow on a trailing twelve month basis as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property  equipment and purchased software  as stated in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we use free cash flow as a measure of our ability to generate cash for both our short term and long term operating and business expansion needs 
we use a twelve month period to measure our success in this area because of the significant variations that typically occur on a quarterly basis due to the timing of certain cash payments 
free cash flow for the twelve months ended december   was million as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  free cash flow  which is a non gaap measure  can be reconciled to net cash provided by operating activities as follows in millions twelve months ended december net cash provided by operating activities purchases of property  equipment and software free cash flow the increase in net cash flow provided by operating activities of million is explained below in the operating activities section of liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents tcv of contracts signed the amount of total contract value commonly referred to as tcv that we sell during a twelve month period is a measure of our success in capturing new business in the various outsourcing and consulting markets in which we provide services and includes contracts with new customers and contracts for new services with existing customers 
we measure tcv as our estimate of the total expected revenue from contracts that are expected to generate revenue in excess of a defined amount during a contract term that exceeds a defined length of time 
various factors may impact the timing of the signing of contracts with customers  including the complexity of the contract  competitive pressures  and customer demands 
as a result  we generally measure our success in this area over a twelve month period because of the significant variations that typically occur in the amount of tcv signed during each quarterly period 
during the twelve month period ended december   the amount of tcv signed was billion  as compared to billion for the twelve month period ended december  additional measurements each of our three primary lines of business has distinct economic factors  business trends  and risks that could affect our results of operations 
as a result  in addition to the four metrics discussed above that we use to measure our consolidated financial performance  we use similar metrics for each of these lines of business and for certain industry groups and operating units within these lines of business

because of the complexities associated with system changes  combined with our customers desire to focus on core functions  the healthcare outsourcing market has experienced increased levels of business 
the strength in healthcare revenue comes primarily from two factors our solutions for the healthcare market were developed over several years and are highly customized to the specific business needs of the market

as a result  we have an established presence and brand  which we have strengthened primarily through internal investments in software and solutions 
the healthcare industry continues to be in a state of change as health systems look to transform their clinical and administrative back office operations  payer organizations work to develop new consumer based health models  and as the rate of medical cost inflation continues to be high

we are also required to pay a facility fee based upon the unused credit commitment and certain other fees related to letter of credit issuance 
the credit facility matures in august and requires certain financial covenants  including a debt ebitda ratio and a minimum interest coverage ratio  each as defined in the credit facility agreement 
as discussed above  in march we borrowed million against the credit facility 
in january  we borrowed an additional million in connection with our acquisition of qss  which is discussed further in note subsequent event 
other commitments and contingencies as discussed in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements  we may be required to make million in additional payments to the sellers of eserv over the next two fiscal years  depending on their achievement of certain financial targets 
in addition  we may be required to pay the sellers of tag an additional payment of up to million in depending on their achievement of certain financial targets 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is important to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments and uncertainties and may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our critical accounting policies are limited to those described below 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note  nature of operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we provide services to our customers under contracts that contain various pricing mechanisms and other terms 
these services include infrastructure services  applications services  business process services  and consulting services 
within these four categories of services  our contracts include non construction service deliverables  including infrastructure services and business process services  and construction service deliverables  such as application development and implementation services 
accounting for revenue in single deliverable arrangements revenue for non construction service deliverables is recognized as the services are delivered in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which provides that revenue should be recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
under our policy  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists when a final understanding between us and our customer exists as to the specific nature and terms of the services that we are going to provide  as documented in the form of a signed agreement between us and the customer 

table of contents revenue for non construction services priced under fixed fee arrangements is recognized on a straight line basis over the longer of the term of the contract or the expected service period  regardless of the amounts that can be billed in each period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned or our obligations are fulfilled in a different pattern 
if we are to provide a similar level of non construction services each period during the term of a contract  we would recognize the revenue on a straight line basis since our obligations are being fulfilled in a straight line pattern 
if our obligations are being fulfilled in a pattern that is not consistent over the term of a contract  then we would recognize revenue consistent with the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period 
in determining the proportion of our obligations fulfilled in each period  we consider the nature of the deliverables we are providing to the customer and whether the volumes of those deliverables are easily measured  such as when we provide a contractual number of full time equivalent associate resources 
if the amount of our obligations fulfilled in each period is not easily distinguished by reference to the volumes of services provided  then we would recognize revenue on a straight line basis 
revenue for construction services that do not include a license to one of our software products is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
in general  sop requires the use of the percentage of completion method to recognize revenue and profit as our work progresses  and we primarily use hours incurred to date to measure our progress toward completion 
this method relies on estimates of total expected hours to complete the construction service  which are compared to hours incurred to date  to arrive at an estimate of how much revenue and profit has been earned to date 
although we primarily measure our progress toward completion using hours incurred to date  we may measure our progress toward completion using costs incurred to date if the construction services involve a significant amount of non labor costs 
because these estimates may require significant judgment  depending on the complexity and length of the construction services  the amount of revenue and profits that have been recognized to date are subject to revisions 
if we do not accurately estimate the amount of hours or costs required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not complete our projects within the planned periods of time  or do not satisfy our obligations under the contracts  then revenue and profits may be significantly and negatively affected or losses may need to be recognized 
revisions to revenue and profit estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revenue for the sale of a license from our software products or the sale of services relating to a software license is recognized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition 
in general  sop addresses the separation and the timing of revenue recognition for software and software related services  such as implementation and maintenance services 
sop also requires the application of the percentage of completion method as described in sop for those software arrangements that require significant production  modification  or customization of the software 
as a result  the accounting for revenue related to software arrangements includes many of the estimates and significant judgments discussed above 
revenue for services priced under time and materials contracts and unit priced contracts is recognized as the services are provided at the contractual unit price 
accounting for revenue in multiple deliverable arrangements for those arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we first determine whether each service  or deliverable  meets the separation criteria of financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in general  a deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the customer and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the remaining deliverables in the arrangement 
each deliverable that meets the separation criteria is considered a separate unit of accounting 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each unit of accounting 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting 
after the arrangement consideration has been allocated to each unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method for each unit of accounting as described previously based on the nature of the arrangement and the services included in each unit of accounting 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation 
table of contents criteria of eitf are combined into one unit of accounting  and the most appropriate revenue recognition method is applied 
in arrangements for both non construction and construction services  we may bill the customer prior to performing services  which would require us to record deferred revenue 
in other arrangements  we may perform services prior to billing the customer  which could require us to record unbilled receivables or to defer the costs associated with either the non construction or construction services  depending on the terms of the arrangement and the application of the revenue separation criteria of eitf in certain arrangements we may pay consideration to the customer at the beginning of a contract as an incentive  which is most commonly in the form of cash 
this consideration is recorded in other non current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and is amortized as a reduction to revenue over the term of the related contract 
as a result of our adoption of eitf in  we recognized revenue of approximately million  million  and million during   and  respectively  that were recognized prior to under our accounting for revenue prior to the adoption of eitf and were also included in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which we recorded in the first quarter of contract costs costs to deliver services are expensed as incurred  with the exception of setup costs and the cost of certain construction and non construction services for which the related revenue must be deferred under eitf or other accounting literature 
we defer and subsequently amortize certain setup costs related to activities that enable us to provide the contracted services to customers 
deferred contract setup costs may include costs incurred during the setup phase of a customer arrangement relating to data center migration  implementation of certain operational processes  employee transition  and relocation of key personnel 
we amortize deferred contract setup costs on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related contract 
useful lives range from three years up to a maximum of the term of the related customer contract 
for a construction service in a single deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the total amount that can be billed under the terms of the arrangement  then a loss would generally be recorded in the period in which the loss first becomes probable 
for a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement  if the total estimated costs to complete the construction service exceed the amount of revenue that is allocated to the separate construction service unit of accounting based on the relative fair value allocation  as limited to the amount that is not contingent  then the actual costs incurred to complete the construction service in excess of the allocated fair value would be deferred  up to the amount of the relative fair value  and amortized over the remaining term of the contract 
a loss would generally be recorded on a construction service in a multiple deliverable arrangement if the total costs to complete the service exceed the relative fair value of the service 
deferred contract costs are evaluated for realizability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be realizable 
our evaluation is based on the amount of non refundable deferred revenue that is related to the deferred contract costs and our projection of the remaining gross profits from the related customer contract 
to the extent that the carrying amount of the deferred contract costs is greater than the amount of non refundable deferred revenue and the remaining net gross profits from the customer contract  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal the amount of non refundable deferred revenue and remaining gross profits 
year end bonus plan one of our compensation methods is to pay to certain associates a year end bonus  which is based on associate and team performance  our financial results  and management s discretion 
the amount of bonus expense that we record each quarter is based on several factors  including our financial performance for that quarter  our latest expectations for full year results  and management s estimate of the amount of bonus to be paid at the end of the year 
as a result  the amount of bonus expense that we record in each quarter can vary significantly 

table of contents contingencies we account for claims and contingencies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fas requires that we record an estimated loss from a claim or loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if we determine that it is reasonably possible but not probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred or the amount of a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  then we may disclose the amount or range of estimated loss if the amount or range of estimated loss is material 
accounting for claims and contingencies requires us to use our judgment 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation and seek input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
valuation of goodwill and intangibles our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we could incur 
the determination of the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future business trends and growth at the date of acquisition 
if an event occurs that would cause us to revise the estimates and assumptions we used in analyzing the value of our goodwill or other intangibles  such revision could result in an impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the need for and adequacy of valuation allowances based on the expected realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our latest forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
income tax expense consists of our current and deferred provisions for us and foreign income taxes 
we do not provide for us income tax on the undistributed earnings of our non us subsidiaries 
except for amounts repatriated in pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the act  we intend to either permanently invest our non us earnings or remit such earnings in a tax free manner 
the act created a temporary incentive through december   for us companies to repatriate income earned abroad by providing an percent dividends received deduction for qualifying foreign dividends 
the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings as calculated for income tax purposes of our non us subsidiaries was approximately million at december   and million at december  such earnings include pre acquisition earnings of non us entities acquired through stock purchases and are intended to be invested outside of the us indefinitely 
the ultimate tax liability related to repatriation of such earnings is dependent upon future tax planning opportunities and is not estimable at the present time 
determining the consolidated provision for income taxes involves judgments  estimates  and the application of complex tax regulations 
as a global company  we are required to provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions where we operate  including estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
we are subject to income tax audits by federal  state  and foreign tax authorities  and we are currently under audit by the internal revenue service as well as the indian tax authorities 
we fully cooperate with all audits  but we defend our positions vigorously 
although we believe that we have provided adequate liabilities for uncertain tax positions  the actual liability resulting from examinations by tax authorities could differ substantially from the recorded income tax liabilities and could result in additional income tax expense 
changes to our recorded income tax liabilities resulting from the resolution of tax matters are reflected in income tax expense in the period of resolution 
other factors may cause us to revise our estimates of income tax liabilities including the expiration of statutes of limitations  changes 
table of contents in tax regulations  and tax rulings 
changes in estimates of income tax liabilities are reflected in our income tax provision in the period in which the factors resulting in our change in estimate become known to us 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate on a quarterly basis 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  which requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method 
prior to the adoption of fas r and as permitted by fas and fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we elected to follow apb and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options and implemented the disclosure only provisions of fas and fas under apb  stock compensation expense was recorded when the exercise price of employee stock options was less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
for a further discussion of the impact of fas r on our financial statements  see note  stock options and stock based compensation 
significant accounting standards to be adopted fasb interpretation no 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for and disclosure of uncertainty in tax positions 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the recognition  measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions and on the accounting for related interest and penalties 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the balance sheet 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined the impact this interpretation will have on our results of operations or financial position 
fasb statement no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
fas will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  our adoption of fas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
we generally manage these transactions by ensuring that costs to service these contracts are incurred in the same currency in which revenue is received 
by matching revenue and costs to the same currency  we have been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
we use foreign currency forward contracts or options to manage exposures arising from these transactions when necessary 
we do not foresee changing our foreign currency exposure management strategy 
our use of foreign currency forward contracts expanded in due to increased foreign currency exposures resulting from our acquisition of the remaining interests in perot systems tsi bv during   or million  of our revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase or decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would change total revenue by  or million 
in our opinion  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
at december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents denominated in currencies other than the us dollar
