table of contents note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k  during february  the company acquired derst baking company in savannah  georgia  adding markets in south carolina  eastern georgia and north florida 
in october  the company purchased land and a building in newton  north carolina and converted the building into a bakery facility 
this facility began producing buns in may and expects to begin producing bread in the spring of sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions and product line extensions  marketing and service 
the company manages these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring its higher margin branded products  while using private label products to absorb overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 
sales for fiscal increased from fiscal contributing to this increase were changes in the competitive landscape of the baked foods industry  the company s growth into new markets  acquisitions and increased pricing 
the change in the competitive landscape was primarily due to the exit of some of the company s competitors from certain markets served by the company  therefore allowing the company to gain share in these markets 
while the company expects sales to continue to grow  it cannot guarantee the level of growth achieved in fiscal to continue  as some of the factors involved in the sales growth  such as the exiting of markets by competitors  are not in control of the company 
for fiscal  the company reported diluted income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of  a increase over the reported for fiscal income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was million for fiscal  an increase of as compared to million for fiscal diluted net income per share for fiscal was as compared to per share for fiscal  a increase 
for fiscal  net income was million  a increase over million reported for fiscal critical accounting estimates note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and disclosure of the company s critical accounting estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
the following is a review of the critical assumptions and estimates  and the accounting policies and methods listed below used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  derivative instruments  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles  self insurance reserves  income tax expense and accruals  and pension obligations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives  at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying 
table of contents transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
independent distributors receive a discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers 
the company records such amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase distributor discounts  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses at the time the discount is offered 
the consumer packaged goods industry has used scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
consequently  revenue is not recognized until the product is purchased by the consumer 
this technology is referred to as pay by scan pbs 
during  there was a sharp increase in the use of scan based trading 
in response to this demand  the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs 
the company believes it is a baked foods industry leader in pbs and is aggressively working with its larger customers  such as wal mart  winn dixie  kroger and food lion  to expand the use of pbs 
in fiscal  the company recorded approximately million in sales through pbs 
the company estimates that by the end of fiscal  it will have approximately million in pbs sales 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for additional information 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to the commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into forward purchase agreements and derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of its goodwill on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value of the goodwill may be impaired using a two step process 
the first step of this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the business segment  or reporting unit  with which the goodwill is associated 
this fair value is calculated as the average of projected ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization using a reasonable multiplier  projected revenue using a reasonable multiplier and a discounted cash flow model using a reasonable discount rate 
this fair value is compared to the net assets of the reporting unit  and if less than the net assets  the goodwill is measured for potential impairment under step two 
under step two of this calculation  goodwill is measured for potential impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit  determined in the same manner as a business combination  with the carrying amount of the goodwill 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to goodwill were necessary for the fiscal years ended december   december  or january  the company has intangible assets subject to amortization related to trademarks  customer lists and non compete agreements acquired in acquisitions in prior years 
the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying value of these intangible assets on an annual basis or at a time when events occur that indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
this evaluation is performed by calculating the fair value of the individual intangible assets 
the fair value is calculated as the sum of the present value of a hypothetical royalty rate multiplied by projected operating income defined as earnings before interest and taxes and the present value of the terminal value based on the gordon growth model 
this fair value is compared to the carrying value of the intangible asset  and if less than the carrying value  the intangible asset is written down to fair value 
based on management s evaluation  no impairment charges relating to intangible assets were necessary for the fiscal years ended december   december  or january  
table of contents see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further information relating to the company s goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured for various levels of general liability  auto liability  workers compensation and employee medical and dental coverage 
insurance reserves are calculated on an undiscounted basis based on actual claim data and estimates of incurred but not reported claims developed utilizing historical claim trends 
projected settlements and incurred but not reported claims are estimated based on pending claims  historical trends and data 
though the company does not expect them to do so  actual settlements and claims could differ materially from those estimated 
material differences in actual settlements and claims could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
income tax expense and accruals 
the annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
changes in statutory rates and tax laws in jurisdictions in which we operate may have a material effect on the annual tax rate 
the effect of these changes  if any  would be recognized when the change takes place 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of future taxes to be paid in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these assessments relate to both permanent and temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  as well as estimates of our current tax exposures 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred assets will not be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  if these estimates and assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to adjust its valuation allowance  which could result in a charge to  or an increase in  income in the period such determination is made 
periodically we face audits from federal and state tax authorities  which can result in challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions 
we provide reserves for potential exposures when we consider it probable that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to our position 
we evaluate these reserves on a quarterly basis to insure that they have been appropriately adjusted for events  including audit settlements  that may impact our ultimate payment of such exposures 
while the ultimate outcome of audits cannot be predicted with certainty  we do not currently believe that future audits will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for more information on income taxes 
pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and benefit obligations related to its defined benefit plan based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plan portfolio  past performance of these assets and other factors 
material changes in pension costs and in benefit obligations may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plan and other factors 
effective january   the company curtailed its defined benefit plan that covers the majority of its workforce 
benefits under this plan were frozen  and no future benefits will accrue under this plan 
the company continues to maintain a plan that covers a small number of certain union employees 
the company recorded pension income of million for fiscal a quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal pension income by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would have no material impact on the company s pension income 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return would impact the company s fiscal pension income by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
a quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s fiscal year end pension obligations by approximately million 
the company expects pension income of approximately million for fiscal the discount rate used by the company reflects rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled 
as permitted under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the 
table of contents company has historically used rates of return on high quality fixed income investments  such as those included in the moody s aa bond index  to determine its discount rate 
the historical reference to the moody s yield is characterized as a proxy for the discount rate that would have been generated through a more rigorous cash flow matching technique 
during fiscal  the company determined it appropriate to refine the prior estimation approach to use a more rigorous cash flow matching technique to select the discount rate  as the use of the moody s index as a proxy has declined 
given the current market dynamics  the company believes the cash flow matching technique provides a better estimate of the discount rate than the moody s index 
in developing the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at each measurement date  the company evaluates input from its investment advisors and actuaries in light of the plan assets historical actual returns and current economic conditions 
the average annual return on the plan assets for the last years is approximately net of investment expenses 
based on this historical annual return on plan assets  the company believes a long term rate of return assumption of for fiscal is reasonable 
the expected long term rate of return assumption is based on a target asset allocation of equity securities  debt securities  other diversifying strategies including  but not limited to  absolute return funds  real estate and cash 
the company regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the plan assets to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension costs do not include an explicit investment management expense assumption and the return on asset rate reflects long term expected returns net of investment expenses 
the company determines the fair value of substantially all its plan assets utilizing market quotes rather than developing smoothed values  market related values or other modeling techniques 
plan asset gains or losses in a given year are included with other actuarial gains and losses due to remeasurement of the plans projected benefit obligations pbo 
if the total unrecognized gain or loss exceeds of the larger of i the pbo or ii the market value of plan assets  the excess of the total unrecognized gain or loss is amortized over the estimated average future lifetime of participants in the frozen pension plan 
the total unrealized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of september  for all of the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
amortization of an immaterial amount of unrealized losses was required during fiscal the total unrecognized loss as of the fiscal measurement date of september  for the pension plans the company sponsors was million 
no amortization of these unrecognized amounts are anticipated during fiscal to the extent that this unrecognized loss is subsequently recognized  then this loss will increase the company s pension costs in the future 
on september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
sfas was effective for public companies for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of sfas at december   the end of its fiscal year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for information regarding the incremental effect of adopting sfas during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  the company contributed million  million and million  respectively  to the defined benefit plans 
future pension contributions will depend on market conditions 
in fiscal  there are no required pension contributions under the minimum funding requirements of erisa 
the company continues to review various contribution scenarios and it has not made a determination whether it will make any pension contributions during fiscal the company has evaluated the potential impact of the pension protection act the act  which was passed into law on august   on future pension plan funding requirements based on current market conditions 
the act is not anticipated to have a material effect on the level of future funding requirements or on the company s liquidity and capital resources 
in assessing different scenarios  the company believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without affecting the business strategy of the company

liquidity and capital resources liquidity represents our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet our obligations and commitments as well as our ability to obtain appropriate financing and convert into cash those assets that are no longer required to meet existing strategic and financing objectives 
therefore  liquidity cannot be considered separately from capital resources that consist primarily of current and potentially available funds for use in achieving long range business objectives

furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit facility  ebitda is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants

ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk 
the company uses forward  futures  swap and option contracts to hedge existing or future exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company does not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting the margins from the sale of our products 

table of contents the company enters into commodity forward  futures and option contracts and swap agreements for wheat and  to a lesser extent  other commodities in an effort to provide a predictable and consistent commodity price and thereby reduce the impact of volatility in its raw material and packaging prices 
at december   the fair market value of the company s commodity derivative portfolio was million 
of this fair value  million is based on quoted market prices and million is based on models and other valuation methods 
million  million and an immaterial amount of this fair value relates to instruments that will be utilized in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to commodity price risk 
based on the company s derivative portfolio as of december   a hypothetical ten percent increase in commodity prices under normal market conditions could potentially have a million effect on the fair value of the derivative portfolio 
the analysis disregards changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged item  however  the company expects that any gain in fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by increases in raw material and packaging prices 
the cash effects of the company s commodity derivatives are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flow from operating activities
