item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we are currently engaged primarily in the business of developing and constructing  and then owning and operating  a network of three onshore lng receiving terminals  and related natural gas pipelines  along the gulf coast of the united states 
we are also developing a business to market lng and natural gas 
to a limited extent  we are also engaged in oil and natural gas exploration and development activities in the gulf of mexico 
we operate four business activities lng receiving terminal  natural gas pipeline  lng and natural gas marketing  and oil and gas exploration and development 
lng receiving terminal business we have focused our development efforts on three lng receiving terminal projects at the following locations sabine pass lng in western cameron parish  louisiana on the sabine pass channel  corpus christi lng near corpus christi  texas  and creole trail lng at the mouth of the calcasieu channel in central cameron parish  louisiana 
although we currently own interests in each of the three lng receiving terminals  we anticipate that our interest in the sabine pass lng receiving terminal will decrease to approximately upon completion of cheniere energy partners  lp s proposed initial public offering 
in addition  we own a interest in a fourth project  freeport lng  located on quintana island near freeport  texas 
our three lng receiving terminals have an aggregate designed regasification capacity of approximately bcf d  subject to expansion 
we have entered into long term tuas with total  chevron and cheniere marketing for an aggregate of bcf d of the available regasification capacity 
construction of the sabine pass lng receiving terminal commenced in march  and we anticipate commencing operations during the second quarter of we will contemplate making a final investment decision to complete construction of the corpus christi and commence construction of the creole trail lng receiving terminals upon  among other things  achieving acceptable commercial arrangements 
natural gas pipeline business we anticipate developing natural gas pipelines from each of our three lng receiving terminals to provide optimal access to north american natural gas markets 
we anticipate commencing construction of the sabine pass pipeline in the second quarter of with construction completed and the pipeline available for commercial operations in the fourth quarter of we anticipate commencing construction of phase of the creole trail pipeline consisting of miles of natural gas pipeline in the second quarter of and that phase operations will commence in the second quarter of construction contracts for the corpus christi pipeline have not been negotiated 
lng and natural gas marketing business our lng and natural gas marketing business is in its early stages of development 
we intend to purchase lng from foreign suppliers  arrange the transportation of lng to our network of lng receiving terminals  utilize cheniere marketing s revaporization capacity at our lng receiving terminals to revaporize imported lng  arrange the transportation of revaporized natural gas through our pipelines and other interconnected pipelines  and sell natural gas to buyers 
alternatively  we may purchase lng from foreign suppliers and sell the lng to foreign purchasers if more favorable economic conditions exist in those markets 
to develop our capability to resell revaporized natural gas in the future  we are engaging in domestic natural gas purchase and sale  transportation and storage transactions  including financial derivative transactions  as part of our marketing activities 
oil and gas exploration and development business although our focus is primarily on the development of lng related businesses  we continue to be involved to a limited extent in oil and gas exploration  development and exploitation 
we have historically focused on 
table of contents evaluating and generating drilling prospects using a regional and integrated approach with a large seismic database as a platform 
our current oil and gas exploration and development activities are focused on the cameron project and the offshore texas project area 
liquidity and capital resources we are primarily engaged in lng related business activities 
our three lng terminal projects  as well as our proposed pipelines  will require significant amounts of capital and are subject to risks and delays in completion 
in addition  our marketing business will need a substantial amount of capital for hiring employees  satisfying creditworthiness requirements of contracts and developing the systems necessary to implement our business strategy 
we have obtained financing and approval of our board of directors to construct phase and phase stage of the sabine pass lng receiving terminal and the sabine pass pipeline  at an estimated cost of billion to billion and million  respectively 
in addition  we have obtained financing and board approval to procure all of the pipe needed for both phase and phase of the creole trail pipeline at a cost of approximately million  as well as million for creole trail pipeline construction costs 
we will need to obtain additional financing and board of directors approval in order to construct our remaining proposed projects  including the remainder of the creole trail pipeline  the creole trail lng receiving terminal  the corpus christi lng receiving terminal and the corpus christi pipeline 
we anticipate that a portion of the net proceeds we receive from the proposed initial public offering by cheniere energy partners  lp will be available for use  together with other funds  to finance projects so approved 
as of december   we had working capital of million  of which million was restricted cash 
we believe that we have adequate financial resources available to us to implement the currently approved projects described above 
we must augment our existing sources of cash with significant additional funds in order to carry out our long term business plan for the remaining proposed projects pending approval as described in the preceding paragraph 
our lng related business activities are not expected to begin to operate and generate significant cash flows before we currently expect that our capital requirements will be financed in part through cash on hand  issuances of project level debt  equity or a combination of the two and in part with net proceeds of debt or equity securities issued by cheniere or its subsidiaries 
customer tuas each of the customers at the sabine pass lng receiving terminal must make payments under its tua on a take or pay basis  which means that the customer will be obligated to pay the full contracted amount of monthly fees whether or not it uses any of its reserved capacity 
provided the sabine pass lng receiving terminal has achieved commercial operation at bcf d  which we expect will occur during the second quarter of  these take or pay tua payments will be made as follows from third party customers total has reserved approximately bcf d of regasification capacity and has agreed to make monthly payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year for years commencing april  total  sa has guaranteed total s obligations under its tua up to billion  subject to certain exceptions  and chevron has reserved approximately bcf d of regasification capacity and has agreed to make monthly payments to sabine pass lng aggregating approximately million per year for years commencing not later than july  chevron corporation has guaranteed chevron s obligations under its tua up to of the fees payable by chevron

 accounting for income taxes  and eitf abstract  topic d other matters critical accounting estimates and policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules are critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  we must use our best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
we accomplish this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them 
change in method of accounting for investments in oil and gas properties effective january   we converted from the full cost method to the successful efforts method of accounting for our investments in oil and gas properties 
while our primary focus is the development of our lng related businesses  we have continued to be involved  to a limited extent  in oil and gas exploration and development activities in the us gulf of mexico 
we believe that  in light of our current level of exploration and development activities  the successful efforts method of accounting provides a better matching of expenses to the period in which oil and gas production is realized 
as a result  we believe that the change in accounting method at this time is appropriate 
the change in accounting method constitutes a change in accounting principle  requiring that all prior period financial statements be adjusted to reflect the results and balances that would have been reported had we been following the successful efforts method of accounting from our inception 

table of contents the cumulative effect of the change in accounting method as of december  and was to reduce the balance of our net investment in oil and gas properties and retained earnings at those dates by million and million  respectively 
the change in accounting method resulted in a decrease in the net loss of million and an increase in the net loss of million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and had no impact on earnings per share basic and diluted for these respective periods see note adjustment to financial statements successful efforts of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the change in method of accounting had no impact on cash or working capital 
accounting for lng activities we begin capitalizing the costs of our lng receiving terminals and related pipelines once the individual project meets the following criteria i regulatory approval has been received  ii financing for the project is available and iii management has committed to commence construction 
prior to meeting these criteria  most of the costs associated with a project are expensed as incurred 
these costs primarily include professional fees associated with front end engineering and design work  costs of securing necessary regulatory approvals  and other preliminary investigation and development activities related to our lng receiving terminals and related natural gas pipelines 
costs that are capitalized prior to a project meeting the criteria otherwise necessary for capitalization include land costs  costs of lease options and the cost of certain permits which are capitalized as intangible lng assets 
the costs of lease options are amortized over the life of the lease once it is obtained 
if no lease is obtained  the costs are expensed 
site rental costs and related amortization of capitalized options have been capitalized during the construction period through the end of beginning in  such costs have been expensed as required by fsp during the construction periods of our lng receiving terminals and related pipelines  we capitalize interest and other related debt costs in accordance with the fasb sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  as amended by sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method an amendment of fasb statement no 

upon commencement of operations  capitalized interest  as a component of the total cost  will be amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
revenue recognition lng regasification capacity fees are recognized as revenue over the term of the respective tuas 
advance capacity reservation fees are initially deferred 
successful efforts method of accounting we have elected to follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under this method  production costs  geological and geophysical costs including the cost of seismic data  delay rentals  costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells  and internal costs directly related to our exploration and development activities are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of property acquisitions  successful exploratory wells  development costs  and support equipment and facilities are initially capitalized when incurred 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review proved oil and gas properties and other long lived assets for impairment when events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of the carrying value of such properties  such as a downward revision of the reserve estimates or commodity prices 
we estimate the future cash flows expected in connection with the properties and compare such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
when the carrying amounts of the properties exceed their estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the carrying amount of the properties is written down to their estimated fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved 
table of contents reserves  future commodity prices  timing of future production  future capital expenditures and a risk adjusted discount rate 
individually significant unproved properties are also periodically assessed for impairment of value  and a loss is recognized at the time of impairment by providing an impairment allowance 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of proved oil and gas properties is determined on a field by field basis using the unit of production method over the life of the remaining proved reserves 
we account for the retirement of our tangible long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and a corresponding increase in the carrying amount of the related long lived assets 
subsequently  the asset retirement costs included in the carrying amount of the related asset are allocated to expense using the unit of production method used to depreciate oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and our reserve data are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
at least annually  our reserves are estimated by an independent petroleum engineer 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the present value of future net cash flows does not necessarily represent the current market value of our estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimate of proved reserves declines  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases thereby reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomical to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
regulated natural gas pipelines our developing natural gas pipeline business is subject to the jurisdiction of the ferc in accordance with the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of  and we have determined that certain of our pipeline systems to be constructed have met the criteria set forth in sfas no 
accordingly  we have applied the provisions of sfas no 
to the affected pipeline subsidiaries beginning in the second quarter of our application of sfas no 
is based on the current regulatory environment  our current projected tariff rates  and our ability to collect those rates 
future regulatory developments and rate cases could impact this accounting 
although discounting of our maximum tariff rates may occur  we believe that the standards required by sfas no 
for its application are met and the use of regulatory accounting under sfas no 
best reflects the results of future operations in the economic environment in which we will operate 
regulatory accounting requires us to record assets and liabilities that result from the rate making process that would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
we will continue to evaluate the application of regulatory accounting 
table of contents principles based on on going changes in the regulatory and economic environment 
items that may influence our assessment are inability to recover cost increases due to rate caps and rate case moratoriums  inability to recover capitalized costs  including an adequate return on those costs through the rate making process and the ferc proceedings  excess capacity  increased competition and discounting in the markets we serve  and impacts of ongoing regulatory initiatives in the natural gas industry 
natural gas pipeline costs include amounts capitalized as an allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
the rates used in the calculation of afudc are determined in accordance with guidelines established by the ferc 
afudc represents the cost of debt and equity funds used to finance our natural gas pipeline additions during construction 
afudc is capitalized as a part of the cost of our natural gas pipelines 
under regulatory rate practices  we generally are permitted to recover afudc  and a fair return thereon  through our rate base after our natural gas pipelines are placed in service 
cash flow hedges as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  cash flow hedge transactions hedge the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows ie  in our case  the variability of floating interest rate exposure 
in the case of cash flow hedges  the hedged item the underlying risk is generally unrecognized ie  not recorded on the balance sheet prior to settlement  and any changes in the fair value  therefore  will not be recorded within earnings 
conceptually  if a cash flow hedge is effective  this means that a variable  such as a movement in interest rates  has been effectively fixed so that any fluctuations will have no net result on either cash flows or earnings 
therefore  if the changes in fair value of the hedged item are not recorded in earnings  then the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument the derivative must also be excluded from the income statement or else a one sided net impact on earnings will be reported  despite the fact that the establishment of the effective hedge results in no net economic impact 
to prevent such a scenario from occurring  sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge be recorded as an asset or liability on the balance sheet  but with the offset reported as part of other comprehensive income  to the extent that the hedge is effective 
we assess both at the inception of each hedge and on an on going basis  whether the derivatives that are used in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged items 
on an on going basis  we monitor the actual dollar offset of the hedges market values compared to hypothetical cash flow hedges 
the cash flow hedge contracts are generally deemed to be highly effective if the r squared is greater than percent and the dollar offset correlation is within percent to percent 
any ineffective portion of the cash flow hedges will be reflected in earnings 
goodwill goodwill is accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year  although we may perform a goodwill impairment review more frequently whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated the results of prior periods 
under this 
table of contents method  we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted after january  and prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   in accordance with sfas r using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  did not recognize compensation expense for options granted that had an exercise price greater than or equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
we believe that implied volatility  calculated based on traded options of our common stock  combined with historical volatility is an appropriate indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends 
therefore  expected volatility for the year ended december  was based on a combination of implied and historical volatilities 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
see note share based compensation of our notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on share based compensation 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments 
sfas no 
provides entities with relief from having to separately determine the fair value of an embedded derivative that would otherwise be required to be bifurcated from its host contract in accordance with sfas no 
sfas no 
allows an entity to make an irrevocable election to measure such a hybrid financial instrument at fair value in its entirety  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires entities to recognize a servicing asset or liability each time they undertake an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations 
this statement also requires all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities to be initially measured at fair value and permits a choice of either the amortization or fair value measurement method for subsequent measurement 
the effective date of this statement is for annual periods beginning after september   with earlier adoption permitted as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year provided the entity has not issued any financial statements for that year 
we do not plan to adopt sfas no 
early  and we are currently assessing the impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this new standard also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin no 
are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption 
table of contents of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin no 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin no 
should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that fiscal year 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted as long as the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  in the period of adoption 
we believe that the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
we believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan an amendment of fasb statement no

will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued fsp no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
fsp no 
aug air prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method for accounting for major maintenance activities and confirms the acceptable methods of accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
fsp no 
aug air is effective the first fiscal year beginning after december  we believe that the adoption of fsp no 
aug air will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity prices we produce and sell natural gas  crude oil and condensate 
as a result  our financial results can be affected as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we have not entered into any derivative transactions related to our oil and gas producing activities 
cash investments we have cash investments that we manage based on internal investment guidelines that emphasize liquidity and preservation of capital 
such cash investments are stated at historical cost  which approximates fair market value on our consolidated balance sheet
