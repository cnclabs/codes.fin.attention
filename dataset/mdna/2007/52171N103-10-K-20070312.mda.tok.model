overview we design  develop and market analog and mixed signal semiconductors that enable and enhance the features and capabilities of mobile and other consumer products 
our core products are color display drivers with integrated controllers  which are critical components in displays used in mobile consumer electronics device  but we have recently announced the expansion of our business into led drivers 
we began operations in and began commercially shipping our products in the third quarter of we focus on the design  development and marketing of our products and outsource all of the fabrication  assembly and testing of our products to outside subcontractors 
we believe this concentrated focus enables us to provide our customers with critical time to market and product differentiation advantages 

table of contents we sell our semiconductor products to display module manufacturers  which incorporate our products into their display module subassemblies for mobile handset manufacturers and other consumer electronic devices 
we currently generate all of our revenue from customers in asia 
our sales are generally made pursuant to standard purchase orders that may be cancelled or the shipment dates may be delayed by the customer 
we operate in one operating segment  comprising the design  development and marketing of mixed signal semiconductors for small panel displays 
although some of our products are suitable for use in other consumer electronic device markets  we have primarily focused on the mobile handset market 
the mobile handset market is characterized by rapidly evolving technology  intense competition among a concentrated group of manufacturers  and continually changing consumer preferences 
these factors result in the frequent introduction of new products  product life cycles that typically range from two to three years  continually evolving mobile handset specifications and significant price competition 
to be successful  we must be able to introduce new products that satisfy the evolving technology and product specifications in an efficient and timely manner 
selling prices for our products and those of our competitors steadily decline during their life cycles 
therefore  if products do not enter commercial production on schedule their profitability declines significantly 
in addition  in the past  mobile handset manufacturers have inaccurately forecast consumer demand  which has led to significant changes in orders to their component suppliers 
we have experienced both increases and decreases in orders due to changes in demand and delays in production by our customers  often with limited advance notice  and we expect such order changes to occur in the future 
total revenue was million in  an increase of from million in unit shipments were million in  an increase of as compared to gross margin declined to in as compared to in  due primarily to timing of new product introductions 
operating expenses increased to million in as compared to million in  as a result of adoption of sfas no 
r in our net loss was million in as compared to net loss of million in despite our net loss in  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments remained flat as compared to the prior year end 
our revenue was derived primarily from sales of color super twisted nematic  or cstn  and thin film transistor  or tft  display driver devices 
over the past few years the market has migrated to tft devices at a time when we did not have sufficient competitive product offerings available to meet the changing market  which hurt our business 
our revenue improved in as compared to the prior year as we introduced newer versions of both cstn and tft devices in late and which generated stronger sales volumes 
in spite of these sales increases  our net loss increased due to lower gross margins  as well as our operating expense increase resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r 
we are focusing our new product development efforts on tft devices and innovative display technologies 
we are also investing in new process technology efforts to enable us to design our newer products to a smaller die size  thereby reducing the manufacturing cost per unit 
the timely introduction of new products with smaller die sizes is essential to improving gross margins on our products 
we currently expect sales to be lower than sales  resulting in a net loss for we did not generate sufficient design wins at high enough volumes to compensate for expected sales declines on legacy products 
this reduction also reflects our transition to a greater focus on tft product development rather than cstn development 
we believe tft devices provide a better opportunity for long term growth at gross margins above current levels  although we cannot assure you that we will successfully increase our revenue in tft devices nor that we will be able to sell our products at higher margins 
in the short term  our transition away from cstn devices will negatively impact total sales 
we are also moving some of our research and development focus into new product areas  including light emitting diode  or led  drivers  touch technology sensors and consumer audio applications 
our expansion into consumer audio is the result of our recently announced acquisition of mondowave inc we believe this diversification provides us a better opportunity for long term profitable growth 
we cannot assure you that our development efforts in these areas will be successful 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
table of contents assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
on an ongoing basis we re evaluate our judgments and estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  stock based compensation  warranty obligations and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting estimates  which are discussed further below 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and material effects on our operating results and financial position may result 
in addition to making critical accounting estimates  we must ensure that our financial statements are properly stated in accordance with gaap 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions eg  stock based compensation  depreciation methodology  etc we believe that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  inventory valuation  warranty obligations  income taxes and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  most of our sales were to large established companies based on purchase orders from these customers with minimal collectibility issues 
customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the credit worthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria will not be met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we perform credit evaluations of each of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we regularly monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon any specific customer collection issues we have identified and our best estimate of allowance requirements 
while we have not experienced any significant credit losses to date  we may experience substantially higher credit loss rates in the future 
our accounts receivable are generally concentrated in a limited number of customers  and we expect them to remain concentrated in the future 
we may increase our credit risk as we expand our limited customer base due to the credit worthiness of newer customers compared with our existing customers 
any significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any current or future customer could make it more difficult for us to collect our accounts receivable and require us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventory valuation 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost computed on a first in  first out basis or market 
we record inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories by comparing quantity on hand with forecasted future sales based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those expected by management  additional inventory reserve may be required 
when analyzing inventory reserves  we take into consideration the quantity of inventory on hand as well as purchase commitments 
we specifically reserve for lower of cost or market if pricing trends or forecasts indicate that the carrying value of our inventory exceeds its estimated selling price less the cost to dispose of inventory 
the reserve is reviewed each period to ensure that it reflects changes in our actual experience 
once 
table of contents inventory is written down  a new accounting basis is established and  accordingly  it is not written back up in future periods 
our inventory reserve requirements may change in future periods based on actual experience  the life cycles of our products or market conditions 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality assessment  our warranty obligation may be affected by future product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we regularly monitor product returns and maintain a reserve for warranty expenses based upon our historical experience and any specifically identified failures 
as we sell new products to our customers  we must exercise considerable judgment in estimating the expected failure rates 
this estimation process is based on historical experience of similar products as well as various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
from time to time  we may be subject to additional costs related to warranty claims from our customers 
if this occurs in a future period  we would make judgments and estimates to establish the related warranty liability  based on historical experience  communication with our customers  and various assumptions based on the circumstances 
this additional warranty would be recorded in the determination of net income in the period in which the additional cost was identified 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
the tax consequences of most events recognized in the current year s financial statements are included in determining income taxes currently payable 
however  because tax laws and financial accounting standards differ in their recognition and measurement of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue  expenses  gains and losses  differences arise between the amount of taxable income and pretax financial income for a year and between the tax basis of assets or liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
because it is assumed that the reported amounts of assets and liabilities will be recovered and settled  respectively  a difference between the tax basis of an asset or a liability and its reported amount in the balance sheet will result in a taxable or a deductible amount in some future years when the related liabilities are settled or the reported amounts of the assets are recovered  hence giving rise to a deferred tax asset 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or tax strategies and to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be recovered  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we continually review our estimates related to our income tax obligations  and revise our estimates  if necessary 
a revision in our estimates of our tax obligations will be reflected as an adjustment to our income tax provision at the time of the change in our estimates 
such a revision could materially impact our effective tax rate  income tax provision and net income 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty in the application of complex tax laws 
we record tax reserves for additional taxes that we estimate we may be required to pay as a result of potential examinations by tax authorities 
if such payments ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the reversal of these tax reserves would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period we determine such reserves are no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  an additional charge to expense will result 
during  we established a valuation allowance for our us deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
cumulative losses incurred in the u 
s in recent years represented sufficient negative evidence under sfas no 
to require a full valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance in the us until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which addresses the accounting for stock based payments transactions in which an enterprise receives employee services in exchange for a equity instruments of the enterprise or b liabilities that are based on the fair value of 
table of contents the enterprise s equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments 
in january  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and instead generally requires that such transactions be accounted for using a fair value based method and recognized on a straight line basis for awards granted after january  over the vesting period of the award 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock based awards under sfas no 
r  consistent with the approach previously used for our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for share based compensation 
the black scholes model requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility and expected life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life is calculated using the simplified method allowed under sab no 
in addition  stock based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures that are based on historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model or forfeiture rate change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our financial results 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted under sfas no 
r  and accordingly prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense be recorded for all new and unvested stock options that are expected to vest  and employee stock purchase plan activity  over the requisite service periods beginning on january   the first day of our fiscal year prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation cost was recognized based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
sfas no 
defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity investment 
we used the black scholes model to estimate the fair value 
this model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected time until exercise  which greatly affect the fair value 
we reviewed these assumptions periodically and modified them as conditions changed 
we calculated our stock price volatility and compared with that of peer companies to determine the reasonableness of this variable 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
we amortized deferred stock based compensation on the graded vesting method over the vesting periods of the stock options  which is generally four years 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in accelerated vesting as compared to the straight line method 
as required under sfas no 
r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle benefit of million for the year ended december   reflecting estimated future forfeitures of options previously expensed under apb no

our tft sales in more than quadrupled and sales of cstn devices increased significantly as compared to these increases were offset by a significant decline in oled sales 
our average selling price in declined from display driver price is a function of technology  the maturity of the device sold and general industry conditions 
the average selling price decline reflects our product sales predominantly into low end mobile handsets 
in addition  this average selling price decline is caused by an increase in lower priced stn sales as a percentage of total sales for the comparable periods 
we have experienced general price declines across the display driver space over the past two years 
we currently expect sales in to decrease as compared to sales  as we were unable to secure enough high volume design wins from product introductions to compensate for sales declines in older products 
while new product introductions in the first half of may improve our sales outlook for the second half of  we cannot assure you that these new introductions will occur timely  nor can we assure you that these new introductions will generate sufficient sales to offset declines on older products 
we currently expect only modest revenue contributions from our new led and audio product initiatives and no revenue contribution from touch technology product initiative in total revenue decreased million  or  in as compared to approximately million units were sold in  a decrease as compared to approximately million units sold in the decline in revenue was primarily the result of the market transitioning from older k cstn and oled devices to newer k cstn and tft products at a time when we did not have sufficient competitive products available to meet the changing market 
while we experienced growth in sales of k cstn  tft and monochrome stn devices in  these increases were not sufficient to compensate for the significant declines in sales of k cstn and oled devices 
display driver price is a function of technology as well as the maturity of the device sold 
our average selling price in declined slightly more than half from  reflecting overall price erosion in the display driver market due to competitive conditions  the technology mix in our products sold and a greater proportion of our sales from mature products in

in the second quarter of  philips mobile display systems merged with toppoly optoelectronics corporation  another of our customers  to form tpo displays corp 
as a result  sales to these two customers are combined under the name tpo displays corp

revenue from samsung sdi decreased in absolute dollars in compared to reflecting lower sales of our oled products  partially offset by new demand for our stn products 
revenue from tpo displays corp 
declined significantly in as compared to  reflecting the product and technology transitions to newer generation tft and cstn devices 
we will likely experience shifts in our customer concentration in resulting from the ramping down of certain older programs and the ramp up of new programs at different customers  and consistent with customer shifts experienced in the past 
for example  sales to rikei corporation  a japanese distributor  increased in the fourth quarter of and are likely to continue to increase with the growth of several new programs at japanese customers 
we currently expect sales to samsung sdi to decrease in with older stn and oled programs declining 
while we seek to add additional customers  we expect to remain reliant on a small number of customers for the foreseeable future 
in addition  existing customers may reduce their demand  as has occurred in the past  which could cause period to period fluctuations between customers representing significant amounts of our revenue

gross profit vs 
vs 
change change in thousands gross profit of total revenue gross profit decreased million  or  in as compared to  due to the lack of sales volume of sufficient new products with higher gross margins to offset gross margin declines on older products 
gross margin decreased to in from in our blended average selling price declined in  and our manufacturing cost declines were unable to keep pace with these price declines 
further  our recent new products were introduced later than originally planned  and therefore are competing with established product offerings from competitors that had already begun to experience price declines 
we continue to rely on our sales of legacy products introduced more than one year ago 
the products are designed and manufactured on older process technology  thereby impairing our gross margins 
die shrinks made possible by transitioning to newer process technology are essential to enable cost reductions in line with selling price reductions on mature products  and to enable more favorable gross margins on newly introduced products 
finally  we recorded a charge of million to write down inventory and record purchase commitment reserves in due to inventory quantities on hand and ordered in excess of forecasted demand  which contributed to the higher cost of sales in as compared to gross profit in  compared to  decreased million  or  primarily due to revenue declines 
gross margin decreased to in  as compared to in  due to lower average selling prices as compared to the prior period  our mix of products sold and spreading our fixed costs over a smaller revenue base 
the lower average selling prices resulted from competitive pricing pressure by handset makers that drove down component costs  including display drivers 
in addition  a greater percent of our sales were of mature products  which generally had lower selling prices 
finally  with the significant decrease in revenue  our fixed costs were spread over a smaller revenue base  increasing these costs as a percent of sales 
we recorded a charge of million to write down inventory in due to inventory quantities on hand in excess of forecasted demand 
the impact of the lower average selling prices was partially mitigated by reductions in wafer and test costs 
we seek to improve gross margin in future periods through the timely introduction of our new product offerings  although we cannot assure you that we will successfully introduce such products in a timely fashion or that such products will be accepted by the market at the prices required to improve our gross margin 
for example  we previously established a goal to ship ten new products in volume during  but only shipped seven new devices 
this reduction in new product introductions negatively impacts our opportunity for revenue growth and margin improvement in future periods 
we also seek to improve our gross margin through designing future products on newer process technology nodes  enabling us to reduce the die size and thereby reduce the cost per unit 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in designing new products  manufacturing these new products on new process technologies at sufficient yields to improve margins  nor that we will gain customer acceptance of such new devices

research and development expenses declined million  or  and decreased as a percentage of revenue in as compared to the costs associated with pre production wafer manufacturing and qualifying new products and processes decreased million for the periods covered due to more efficient utilization and the timing of wafer qualification activities 
partially offsetting this decrease were increases of million due to additional headcount and related infrastructure to support our new product development efforts  million in depreciation expense on equipment and software purchased to assist in new product design  and million in other expenses primarily related to consultant fees and facility rent expense 
wafer qualification costs are likely to fluctuate in future periods based on the timing of such activities 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in as compared to the decrease in research and development expenses was largely due to decreases in stock based compensation expenses of million 
additionally  we reduced wafer process fees by million  costs associated with qualifying new products and processes by million and costs of test wafers and mask sets by million 
these reductions were due to more efficient wafer qualification activities 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million associated with increased headcount and related infrastructure expenses during  to support our business plan and pursue growth opportunities  and an increase of million due to higher depreciation expense on equipment and software purchased to assist in new product design

selling  general and administrative expenses in increased by million  or  but decreased as a percentage of revenue compared to the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to the million increase in stock based compensation expenses 
approximately million of the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was related to additional headcount and infrastructure costs to support our long term growth prospects

approximately million of the increase was due to additional headcount and related infrastructure to support our long term growth prospects 
consulting costs  primarily related to compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  increased approximately million 
an additional million of the increase was due to legal  accounting and insurance costs incurred as a public company 
accounting costs in particular increased due to higher audit fees in connection with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
legal cost increases resulted from the securities class action lawsuit 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in stock based compensation of million 
the increase in expenses in was also the result of being a public company for the entire year compared to only six months in

although we incurred cumulative losses in both and  we are subject to taxes in the various countries where we operate  therefore our effective tax rate is dependent on the mix of activities by country 
our net losses include stock based compensation expense of million in and million in the stock based compensation expense for international employees is generally nondeductible based on tax rules in the countries where these employees reside 
in addition  stock based compensation expense on incentive stock options issued to us employees is generally nondeductible 
these nondeductible expenses result in a higher tax rate for the company 
these charges increased our effective tax rate approximately in and in our tax rate for is not indicative of the rate we would expect on a consolidated basis if we generated consolidated net income 
our tax provision for includes a valuation allowance recorded against our net us deferred tax assets of million 
we believe that the uncertainty regarding realization of us deferred tax assets is such that it is appropriate to apply this valuation allowance 
the provision for income taxes in decreased compared to in both absolute dollars and in the effective tax rate 
the decrease in absolute dollars in provision for income taxes was due to our pre tax loss in  as compared to higher pre tax income in although we incurred cumulative losses in  we are subject to taxes in the various countries where we operate  therefore  our effective tax rate is dependent on the mix of activities by country 
the significant decrease in stock based compensation expenses in  as compared to  also contributed to the reduction of effective tax rates in these charges unfavorably impacted our effective tax rate approximately for and for liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through sales of equity securities and through cash generated from operations

these favorable impacts were offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
accounts receivable increased million in  but decreased million in the increase in and the decrease in correspond to the increases and decreases in revenue in the corresponding periods 
additionally  payment terms vary by customer and our receivable balance fluctuates with changes in our customer mix 
our days sales outstanding were at december  and at december  we expect days sales outstanding typically to range from to days 
inventory excluding reserves decreased by million in and increased by million in the decrease in reflects a slowdown in inventory production in the fourth quarter due to anticipated reductions in sales volume in the first quarter of the increase in reflects a broader product portfolio than in the prior year  requiring us to maintain a larger inventory balance  as well as sales volumes anticipated for the first quarter of some of our customers have less visibility into future ordering patterns  requiring us to maintain larger inventory balances to meet greater swings in order demand 
we increased inventory late in for specific tft market opportunities  with certain of these programs delayed by key customers 
due to the significant decrease in net inventory in as compared to  our annualized inventory turns increased to in the fourth quarter of as compared to in the fourth quarter of to effectively manage inventory volumes  we must carefully monitor forecasted sales by device due to the relatively long manufacturing process for semiconductors and risk of obsolescence in a rapidly evolving industry 
we cannot assure you that we will effectively manage our inventory balances to minimize obsolescence and meet rapidly changing customer demand  and any failure to effectively manage inventory could harm our revenues and profitability 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million in and decreased million in  respectively 
the increase in was the result of timing of vendor payments 
the decrease in reflects lower inventory purchasing in as compared to  as we experienced substantially lower sales volume in net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  sales or maturities of available for sale securities  net of purchases of available for sale securities  were million and million in and  respectively 
in each case this reflects changes in our investment portfolio based on interest rate trends  with an increase in cash equivalents in in a rising interest rate market  and lengthening the maturities of our investment portfolio in as interest rate increases subside 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances may fluctuate significantly in future quarters as we manage our investment mix 
all investments comply with our corporate investment policy  with our primary objective being the preservation of principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
we closely monitor the investment yield curve and may in the future invest more of our cash in securities classified as short term investments rather than cash equivalents 
we used cash of million in and million in for the purchase of property and equipment  primarily for equipment and software for our design engineers and secondarily for furniture and leasehold improvements for our worldwide facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   primarily due to proceeds from issuance of our common stock under our stock option and stock purchase plans 
in order to secure key future design wins  we may be required to increase our inventory balances so we can meet rapid increases in product demand from our customers 
for example  in we initiated sales to a customer through a hub  whereby inventory is shipped to a third party warehouse near the customer s manufacturing site and pulled by the customer when required for manufacturing 
we invoice the customer when the customer pulls the inventory from the 
table of contents hub 
this arrangement  and any similar future arrangements  could significantly increase our inventory balances and create short term decreases in cash flow due to the longer period between inventory purchase and customer payment 
we recently announced our entrance into the led driver business as well as engineering activities on touch technology that may generate products for evaluation during on march   we announced the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of mondowave inc for million in cash 
we also agreed to pay certain cash bonuses to mondowave employees joining leadis in future periods for retention and earn out performance goals 
as a result  this transaction will negatively impact our cash flow 
these new activities are expected to negatively impact cash flow  initially from additional engineering activities in these areas 
we may also increase our inventory levels to maintain quantities of new products on hand for new customer activity in these businesses 
in january  our board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock through december  purchases may be made at management s discretion from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or through privately negotiated transactions  as conditions permit 
while we cannot assure you that any or all of the shares authorized for repurchase will be purchased  our cash flow will be negatively impacted if and to the extent shares are purchased 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances and cash expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months  including potential cash requirements for wafer  assembly or test prepayments or possible inventory increases discussed above 
significant financial requirements  such as the acquisition of another company or research and development efforts in a new technology or business  may result in increased expenses and the need for additional cash to fund these new requirements as well as our ongoing business activities 
we continue to evaluate potential strategic acquisitions of all or part of another company 
if needed  we would seek to obtain equity or debt financing to fund these activities 
we cannot assure you that equity or debt financing will be available when needed or  if available  that the financing will be on terms satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we currently have no plans that would require us to seek additional cash

due to lengthy subcontractor lead times  we must order materials and services from these subcontractors well in advance of required delivery dates  and we are obligated to pay for them in accordance with the payment terms 
we expect to receive and pay for substantially all inventory purchased under these purchase obligations within the next three months 
the following sets forth our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations purchase obligations total off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

our primary objective with this investment portfolio is to invest available cash while preserving principal and meeting liquidity needs 
in accordance with our investment policy  we place investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities  which approximated million as of december   and have a weighted average interest rate of approximately  are subject to interest rate risks 
however  based on the liquidity of our investments  we believe that if a significant change in interest rates were to occur  it would not have a material effect on our financial condition

our korean subsidiary carries the foreign currency exchange risk on these us dollar denominated transactions 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts to minimize this exchange rate risk and expect to hedge at least of our foreign exchange transaction exposure in future periods 
to date  the foreign currency transactions and exposure to exchange rate volatility have not been significant 
our policy is to enter into foreign exchange contracts only when an associated underlying foreign currency exposure exists 
we cannot assure you that foreign currency risk will not cause a material impact to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows in the future
