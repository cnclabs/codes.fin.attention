item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
operating businesses that are reported as segments include fossil nuclear  energy and chemicals e c  environmental and infrastructure e i  maintenance  fabrication and manufacturing f m  and investment in westinghouse 
a summary description of each of our operating segments follows 
fossil nuclear segment the fossil nuclear segment provides a range of project related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  technology and consulting services  primarily to the global fossil and nuclear power generation industries 
nuclear 
we support the us domestic nuclear industry with engineering  maintenance and construction services 
we hold a leadership position in nuclear power uprates for existing plants  having brought in excess of  megawatts of new nuclear generation to the electric power transmission grid in the us between and present 
in addition  we are currently serving as architect engineer for the national enrichment facility and are providing engineering services in support of new nuclear units in korea and the people s republic of china 
we anticipate growth in the global nuclear power sector  driven in large part by the us  china and india 
our support of existing us utilities  coupled with our investment in westinghouse  is expected to result in increased levels of activity in this sector for us 
safe and reliable operation of existing plants  concerns associated with climate change  and incentives under the energy policy act of have prompted significant interest in new nuclear construction in the us several domestic utilities are developing plans for new baseload nuclear generation 
according to the nuclear energy institute and the nuclear regulatory commission  in the us  there are plans for new units under development as of october 
table of contents with the westinghouse advanced passive ap design being considered for at least of them 
our existing base of nuclear services work  coupled with our collaboration with westinghouse and the ap design  should position us to capitalize on growth within this industry 
clean coal fired generation 
the rise in oil prices and wide fluctuations in natural gas prices have prompted electric power companies in the us to pursue construction of new coal fired power plants utilizing advanced combustion and emission control technologies 
coal fired capacity is typically expensive to build but has relatively low operating costs 
the continued operating cost advantage of coal over other fossil fuels has prompted electric utilities and independent power producers ipp s in recent years to focus on clean coal fired generation 
during fiscal year  we executed epc contracts for three new  highly efficient coal generation facilities an megawatt supercritical plant in north carolina  a megawatt ultra supercritical plant in arkansas  and a megawatt circulating fluidized bed cfb facility in virginia 
in addition  we are negotiating a contract on a megawatt cfb facility 
we continue to observe a steady stream of new opportunities in this market and expect our experience to position us to share in new clean coal fired generation awards 
air quality control aqc 
our aqc business includes domestic and selected international markets for flue gas desulfurization fgd retrofits  installation of mercury emission controls  projects related to controlling fine particle pollution  carbon capture  and selective catalytic reduction scr markets 
environmental regulations and related air quality concerns have increased the need to retrofit existing coal fired energy plants with modern pollution control equipment 
we have been selected to provide epc retrofit services on many of the power plants requiring fgd for sulfur dioxide emissions control 
the march clean air interstate rule cair issued by the us environmental protection agency epa  which reduces the allowable sulfur dioxide emissions in the eastern half of the us by from levels by and reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides by from levels by  was a major driver for this market 
according to the june argus scrubber report  we believe that over  to  megawatts or approximately to of the domestic coal plants that require fgd retrofit systems are in engineering  construction or startup phase 
we believe that we are the market leader for these services  being awarded approximately to of the estimated domestic market for these services 
we expect most of the currently contracted domestic fgd projects will achieve commercial operation by the end of in order to meet regulatory requirements 
we expect the remaining of the domestic fgd market of approximately  to  megawatts to be contracted over the next three to five years 
there is also a growing market for installation of mercury emission controls at existing coal fired power plants 
the clean air mercury rule camr adopted by epa in may and state regulations imposing even more stringent mercury emission limits are another driver for this retrofit market 
connecticut  massachusetts  new jersey  maryland  and wisconsin currently have state mercury emissions rules and at least other states are in the process of establishing mercury emission rules 
we have two epc mercury control projects under execution 
we believe the domestic market for these services  based on existing federal regulations  is approximately billion over the next four years 
the market could increase in the future as more states establish new rules 
aqc epc opportunities outside the fgd and mercury control markets  such as scr  are expected to be limited to smaller plant maintenance project work in most electric power producers have completed their fleet nox emissions control installations 
however  we plan to pursue nox control work with existing clients 
fine particle pollution regulations were promulgated by the epa in march  the epa issued a rule defining requirements for state plans to reduce concentrations of particulates in areas with levels of fine particle pollution that do not meet national air quality standards 
state plans under this final rule  known as the clean air fine particle implementation rule  are now being developed 
states must meet the fine particle pollution standard by however  in their implementation plans  states may propose an attainment date extension for up to five years 
those areas for which epa approves an extension must achieve epa s national air quality standards for fine particulates no later than 
table of contents gas fired generation 
in fiscal year active investment in new power generation was focused primarily on coal due to its relatively low operating cost compared to natural gas 
we have recently observed some renewed interest in new gas fired generation as electric utilities and ipp s looked to diversify their generation options  but we expect the number of gas fired projects to remain small in comparison to expected coal and nuclear projects 
however  recent initiatives in many states to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are perceived to be contributing to global warming could stimulate demand for gas fired power plants because gas fired plants have substantially lower emissions of carbon dioxide than coal fired plants 
gas fired plants are typically less expensive to construct than coal fired and nuclear plants  but have comparatively higher fuel costs 
we expect this market to expand and believe our capabilities and expertise will position us as a market leader

energy chemical e c segment our e c segment provides a range of project related services  including design  engineering  construction  procurement  technology and consulting services  primarily to the oil and gas  refinery  petrochemical  and chemical industries 
we expect that high crude oil prices will continue to support capital expenditures by our major oil and petrochemical customers and may provide opportunities for us to increase our activity levels in these service areas 

table of contents chemicals 
demand in the chemical industries remains strong  fueled by strong growth in the economies of china and india as well as the rising standard of living in other developing economies 
we expect the number of new petrochemical projects to continue to grow  driven primarily by increasing demand for base chemicals  ethylene  propylene  and other downstream petrochemical products 
internationally  we believe the middle east and china provide the majority of petrochemical capacity expansion opportunities 
in the middle east  we expect new petrochemical opportunities due to relatively high crude oil prices and the availability of lower priced feed stock and natural gas and the proximity of the middle east to the european and asian markets 
during fiscal year  we were awarded petrochemical projects in china and saudi arabia for our acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polymer emulsion technology 
abs is a bridge polymer between commodity plastics and higher performance thermoplastics 
refining 
we believe that refiners are searching for new products that can be produced from petroleum and considering integration production of those products into petrochemical facilities 
we believe the demand for our services in the refining industry has been driven by refiners needs to process a broader spectrum of heavier crude oils and to produce a greater number of products 
additionally  we believe relatively high crude oil prices  combined with refinery capacity constraints and demand stimulated by clean fuels and clean air legislation  are contributing to increasing opportunities primarily in the us and europe 
we are currently participating in a major domestic refinery upgrade incorporating capacity and clean fuels capabilities 
while the refining process is largely a commodity activity  refinery configuration depends primarily on the grade of crude feedstock available  desired mix of end products and considerations of capital and operating costs 
fluid catalytic cracking fcc remains a key refining technology 
we were awarded a number of grass root technology contracts in fiscal year  primarily to facilities in asia 
we have an exclusive agreement with one international customer to license a key fcc derived technology called deep catalytic cracking dcc that encourages the refiner s entry into the petrochemical arena 
we believe this technology is emerging because of its ability to produce propylene  a base chemical that is in short supply and for which demand is growing faster than that of ethylene 
ethylene 
ethylene represents one of our core technologies 
we estimate global demand for ethylene may grow at a rate of over per year for the next three years  driven by the expected increased demand for polyethylene  polyesters  polystyrene and pvc  mainly in asia 
we expect that major oil and petrochemical companies will integrate refining and petrochemical facilities in order to improve profits  providing additional opportunities for us 
in petrochemicals  we have extensive expertise in the construction of ethylene plants  which convert gas and or liquid hydrocarbon feed stocks into ethylene  and derivative facilities which provide the source of many higher value chemical products  including packaging  pipe  polyester  antifreeze  electronics  tires and tubes 
we also perform services related to gas processing including propane dehydrogenation facilities  gas treatment facilities and liquefied natural gas plants 
we believe ethylene production from petroleum derived naphtha is declining due to the availability of alternative low cost ethane feed stock in the middle east 
this change impacts the economic viability of gas feed steam crackers in north america where the natural gas prices are more volatile as a result of commodity market trading conditions 
we expect new facilities to favor primarily gas feed crackers based on ethane extracted from natural gas 
in fiscal year  we were awarded the contract for a major expansion of an ethylene plant in singapore by a major integrated oil and gas company 
we estimate our market share to be approximately of the market during the last years 
we are aware of only four ethylene technology licensor competitors and are well positioned to compete for new opportunities in this market
