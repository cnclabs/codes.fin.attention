item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview we deliver simple  secure and manageable enterprise mobility services  maximizing the productivity of workers as they move between office  home and remote locations 
our policy management services close the gaps in protecting computers  network assets  user identities and data whenever users connect over the internet 
our connectivity services utilize the ipass global virtual network  a unified network of over dial up  wireless  and broadband providers in over countries 
overview of in  we continued to experience a decline in revenues derived from our traditional dial up business as dial up revenue decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease was offset in part by revenues generated from fees and usage of our broadband service 
however  we continued to add new customers during  including from the forbes global  bringing our total forbes global customers to as of december  as we continued to increase the number of broadband access points during the year  increasing our global broadband footprint was a priority for us in we ended with approximately  wi fi and wired hotspots worldwide  approximately  of which were wi fi hotspots and approximately  of which were wired hotspots 
this enabled our customers to remotely access their corporate networks from more locations  at higher speeds and contributed to a million or increase in broadband usage revenue in over going forward  we will continue to focus on delivering innovative services and solutions for our customers  increasing the number of end users of our services for both dial up and broadband access  as well as continue to increase fee revenues from device management and other fee based services 
in  we expect to see continued growth in our business 
however  our success could be limited by several factors  including the timely release of new products  continued market acceptance of our products and the introduction of new products by existing or new competitors 
for a further discussion of these and other risk factors  see the section below entitled risk factors 

table of contents sources of revenues we derive our revenues primarily from providing enterprise connectivity services through our virtual network 
we sell these services directly  as well as indirectly through our channel partners 
we bill substantially all customers on a time basis for usage based on negotiated rates 
we bill the remaining customers based on a fixed charge per active user per month with additional charges for excess time 
substantially all enterprise customers commit to a one to three year contract term 
most of our contracts with enterprise customers contain minimum usage levels 
we bill customers for minimum commitments when actual usage is less than their monthly minimum commitment amount 
we recognize the difference between the minimum commitment and actual usage as fee revenue once the cash for such fee has been collected 
our usage based revenues  which consists of dial up and broadband usage  represented  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have incurred expenses to expand our broadband coverage and are seeking to generate additional revenues from our broadband wired and wireless coverage 
revenues from usage of our broadband services were  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also provide customers with deployment services and technical support throughout the term of the contract 
we typically charge fees for these services on a one time or annual basis  depending on the service provided and the nature of the relationship 
in addition  we also offer customers additional services for which we generally bill on a monthly basis 
with the acquisition of mobile automation  inc in october  we also began generating license and maintenance revenue through software licensing agreements 
revenues generated from license and maintenance fees  together with revenues generated from deployment services and technical support  represented approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important in understanding our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition services and fees we derive substantially all of our revenues from usage fees 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  service has been provided to the customer  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are recognized during the period the services are rendered to end users based on usage at negotiated rates 
we typically require our customers to commit to minimum usage levels 
minimum usage levels can be based on an annual term  monthly term or over the term of the arrangement 
if actual usage in a given period is less than the minimum commitment  we recognize the difference between the actual usage and the minimum commitment as revenue when cash is collected because we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the difference that will be collected 
we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of the difference to be collected because we have from time to time renegotiated minimum commitments in cases where customers have sought renegotiation of their contract for reasons such as a significant downturn in their business or where we have determined that it would be in our best interest to do so 
customers are not contractually entitled to use or otherwise receive benefit for unused service in subsequent periods 

table of contents license and maintenance we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met as set forth in paragraph of sop no 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
one of the critical judgments that we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable balance on a customer by customer basis 
as a result  the timing or amount of revenue recognition may have been different if different assessments of the probability of collection had been made at the time the transactions were recorded in revenue 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected 
another critical judgment that we make involves the fixed or determinable criterion 
we consider payment terms where arrangement fees are due within three months from delivery to be normal contractual terms 
payment terms beyond three months from delivery are considered extended and not fixed or determinable 
for arrangements with extended payment terms  arrangement fee revenues are recognized when fees become due  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
maintenance revenue consists of fees for providing software updates on a when and if available basis and technical support for software products post contract support or pcs 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
payments received in advance of services are deferred until services are performed 
allowances for estimated future returns and discounts are provided for upon recognition of revenue 
accounting for income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
we establish a valuation allowance if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the net deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are included in our consolidated statements of income as a provision for benefit from income taxes 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
when we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if recovery is not likely  we would increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
the available positive evidence at december  included cumulative taxable income during the last three years and a projection of future income limited to three years 
we continue to closely monitor available evidence and may adjust our valuation allowance in future periods 
although we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee this will be the case as our ability to use the net operating losses is contingent upon our ability to generate sufficient taxable income in the carryforward period 
at each period end  we reassess our ability to realize our net operating losses 
if we conclude it is more likely than not that we would not realize the benefit of our net operating losses  we may have to re establish all or a portion of the valuation allowance and therefore record a significant charge to our results of operations 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted fas r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of fas r for a all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of fas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
fas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we have estimated the expected volatility as an input into the black scholes merton valuation formula when assessing the fair value of options granted 
our estimate of volatility was based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price and the volatility of peers in our industry 
to the extent volatility of our stock price increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate was based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
our estimate of expected term of options granted was derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in the sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
in the future  as information regarding post vesting termination becomes more accessible  we may change our method of deriving the expected term 
this change could impact the fair value of our options granted in the future 

table of contents we have elected the alternative transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of equity based compensation 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee equity based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee equity based compensation awards that are outstanding upon the implementation of sfas r 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  related to non vested stock based payments granted to employees 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
restructuring restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs for abandonment of excess facilities  severance and associated employee termination costs related to redundancies resulting from our acquisition of goremote in the first quarter of these charges have been recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that the recognition and measurement of termination costs be recorded when the liability is incurred 
costs for the abandonment of excess facilities has been reduced by estimated income from the sublease of the vacated facilities 
if we are unable to sublease the facilities within the timeframe and for the rates anticipated  we may need to revise our estimates and record additional restructuring charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a detailed assessment of accounts receivable for specific  as well as anticipated  uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on credit profiles of our customers  current economic trends  contractual terms and conditions  and historical payment experience 
we have an allowance for doubtful accounts of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make their required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if we underestimated the allowances required  additional allowances may be required  which would result in an increased general and administrative expense in the period such determination was made 
results of operations revenue december  change change in thousands  except percentages total revenue total revenue increased in as compared to due to offsetting factors 
revenues generated from dial up usage decreased from million in to million in this represents a decrease of million or 
this was offset in part by increases in revenues generated from broadband usage and fees 
revenues generated from usage of our broadband services were million and million dollars for the years ended december  and respectively 
fee revenue increased from million in to million in we expect revenue from dial up usage to continue to decrease in absolute dollars as well as a percentage of total revenue as the use of narrowband as a primary means of enterprise connectivity is expected to continue to decline  but we can not reasonably estimate if the decline will be consistent with that seen from to no individual customer accounted for or more of total revenues for the years ended december   or revenues from software and service fees represented approximately  and of our total revenue in   and  respectively

we expect network access expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and increase as a percentage of revenues as usage shifts from higher margin dial to lower margin broadband 
the growth in network access expenses in over was due primarily to increased usage of our virtual network

we anticipate that our operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
in addition  we may utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies or product lines 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments on hand will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months  including working capital requirements and planned capital expenditures

off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
commitments at december   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
we have signed contracts with some network service providers under which we have minimum purchase commitments that expire on various dates through december other than in the approximately countries in which our sole dial up network service provider is equant  we have contracted with multiple network service providers to provide alternative access points in a given geographic area 
in those geographic areas where we provide access through multiple providers  we are able to direct users to the network of particular service providers

our investment portfolio consists of auction rate and money market securities  asset backed securities  corporate securities  and government securities  generally due within one to two years 
all of our instruments are classified as available for sale 
we place investments with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these securities are subject to interest rate risks 
based on our portfolio content and our ability to hold investments to maturity  we believe that  a hypothetical increase or decrease in current interest rates would not materially affect our interest income 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  which consisted of cash and highly liquid short term investments with original maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase  which we held solely for non trading purposes

table of contents our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we consider all investments to be short term investments  which are classified in the balance sheet as current assets  because the investments can be readily converted at any time into cash or into securities with a shorter remaining time to maturity and the investments are selected for yield management purposes only and we are not committed to holding the investments until maturity 
we determine the appropriate classification of our investments at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designations as of each balance sheet date 
all short term investments and cash equivalents in our portfolio are classified as available for sale and are stated at fair market value  with the unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss
