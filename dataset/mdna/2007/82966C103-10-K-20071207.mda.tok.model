item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in results of operations in this item and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise disclosed all amounts are reported in us dollars 
overview sirona is a leading manufacturer of high tech dental equipment 
sirona focuses on developing innovative systems and solutions for dentists globally 
sirona has served equipment dealers and dentists worldwide for more than years 
the company has its headquarters in long island city  new york and its largest facility in bensheim  germany 
sirona manages its business on both a product and geographic basis and has four reporting segments dental cad cam systems  imaging systems  treatment centers and instruments 
products from each category are marketed in all geographical sales regions 
significant factors that affect sirona s results of operations increased focus on sirona s position in the us market and further global expansion the us market is the largest individual market for sirona 
over the last three fiscal years  sirona experienced strong revenue growth  with us dollar revenue increasing on average by annually 
bolstered by the exchange  which closed on june   this trend has continued in fiscal year several products have generated significant interest in the us market  including  but not limited to  cerec  schick imaging products  galileos  the orthophos xg line  inlab  ineos  c  electrical handpieces and sirolaser 
sirona works together with large distributors in the us market  including patterson dental and henry schein  which accounted for and  respectively  of sirona s global revenues for the fiscal year ended september  the relationship with henry schein was expanded beyond the european markets to the united states in january patterson dental made a payment of million to sirona in july in exchange for the exclusive distribution right for cerec cad cam products in the united states and canada until the amount sirona received was recorded as deferred revenue and will be recognized on a straight line basis commencing at the beginning of the extension of the exclusivity period in fiscal focus on further global expansion in addition to increased us market penetration  sirona has pursued expansion in the rest of the world 
over the last three fiscal years  sales in the rest of the world grew on average by annually 
to support this growth  sirona expanded its local presence and distribution channels by establishing new sales and service locations in spain  france and the united kingdom in  in japan and australia in  in china in and in italy in this expansion resulted in increased sales  gross profit and sg a expense 
changes in ownership of sirona the mdp transaction of june   as well as the eqt transaction of february   resulted in a change of ownership that was accounted for in a manner similar to a business combination under us gaap 
the results of operations of sirona and its legal  tax and financing structure have changed substantially as a result of the mdp transaction and the eqt transaction 
sirona s business was acquired by newly formed entities and sirona incurred substantial fees and expenses not related to its ongoing operations 
the assets and liabilities acquired were partially stepped up to fair value and a related deferred tax liability was recorded 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including ipr d projects which were expensed at the date of closing  was allocated to goodwill and is subject to periodic impairment testing 
sirona s cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative expense and operating results have been and will continue to be materially affected by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from the step up to fair value of sirona s assets and liabilities 
taxes  interest and net income have also been and will continue to be substantially impacted by the structural changes resulting from the mdp transaction and the eqt transaction 
acquisition of schick technologies inc on june   the exchange with schick technologies inc was completed see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations and the cash flows for the year ended september   as well as the balance sheet as of september  have been affected by this reverse acquisition 
the schick assets and liabilities acquired were stepped up to their fair values and a related deferred tax liability was recorded 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including ipr d projects which were expensed at the acquisition date  was allocated to goodwill and is subject to periodic impairment testing 
sirona s cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative expense and operating results are materially affected by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from the inclusion of schick in its consolidated accounts 
taxes  interest and net income will also be impacted by the structural changes resulting from the exchange 
the acquisition is expected to generate operating synergies of to million per year  within months after the acquisition 
transactions accounted for as business combinations ipr d projects acquired in connection with the exchange and the mdp transaction  with fair values of million and million  respectively  were appraised and charged to the income statement at the respective dates of acquisition 
the projects primarily related to i d imaging  ii enhancements to the cad cam system s hardware and software  iii the new treatment center platform and iv intra oral digital imaging 
the fair value of million in connection with the exchange related primarily to the intra oral digital imaging projects 
as of september   the d imaging and the majority of the cad cam system s enhancements have been completed 
the remaining estimated costs to complete the significant projects at september  were i million for an outstanding enhancement to the cad cam system  ii million for the new treatment center platform  and iii million for the intra oral digital imaging projects 
the estimated percentages of completion of the significant projects as of september  were i  ii and iii 
as of september   i the project for enhancements to the cad cam system s hardware and software was more than half way through the product development phase  with the remaining steps prior to the project release phase being the finalization of project development including working models  beta testing and regulatory approvals  ii the new treatment center platform was in the product development phase with the remaining steps prior to the product release phase being beta testing and regulatory approvals  and iii the intra oral digital imaging projects were close to completion as specified prior to the exchange 
it is anticipated that the projects will be completed in fiscal year and begin to generate cash in the fiscal year following their completion 
there are no specific risks and uncertainties associated with these projects  however the general risks relating to the company as discussed under risk factors may apply 
fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rate although the us dollar is sirona s reporting currency  its functional currency varies depending on the country of operation 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of sirona s revenue and approximately of its expenses were in euros 
during the periods under review  the us dollar euro exchange rate has fluctuated significantly  thereby impacting sirona s financial results 
between september  and september   the us dollar euro exchange rate used to calculate items included in sirona s financial statements varied from a low of to a high of 
although sirona does not apply hedge accounting  sirona has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure 
as of september   these contracts had notional amounts totalling million 
because these agreements are relatively short term generally six months  continued fluctuation in the us dollar could materially affect sirona s results of operations 
certain revenue information under results of operations below is presented on a constant currency basis 
this information is a non gaap financial measure 
sirona supplementarily presents revenue on a constant currency basis because it believes this information facilitates a comparison of sirona s operating results from period to period without regard to changes resulting solely from fluctuations in currency rates 
sirona calculates constant currency revenue growth by comparing current period revenues to prior period revenues with both periods converted at the us dollar euro average foreign exchange rate for the current period 
the exchange rates used in converting euro denominated revenues into us dollar in the company s financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap were and for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
loans made to sirona under the new senior credit facility entered into on november  are denominated in the functional currency of the respective borrowers 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our new senior credit facility 
however  intercompany loans are denominated in the functional currency of only one of the parties to the loan agreements 
where intercompany loans are of a long term investment nature  the potential non cash fluctuations in currency exchange rates are reflected within other comprehensive income 
these fluctuations may be significant in any period due to changes in the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results sirona s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  many of which are substantially outside its control  including the timing of new product introductions by sirona or its competitors  the timing of industry trade shows  developments in government reimbursement policies  changes in product mix  sirona s ability to supply products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in manufacturing costs  income tax incentives  and currency fluctuation 
due to the variations which sirona has experienced in its quarterly operating results  it does not believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations of sirona are necessarily meaningful or reliable as indicators of future performance 
taxes the german tax authorities examined the tax returns for the fiscal years the results of the tax examination were discussed during a meeting with the representatives of the german tax authority and are fully reflected in our financial statements 
we do not expect that fiscal years will be subject to further review by the german tax authority 
in august a new tax law was enacted in germany which becomes effective january  the new law reduces corporate tax rates in germany and resulted in a revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities and assets  providing the company with a non cash tax benefit of  results of operations because both the eqt transaction and the mdp transaction materially changed the carrying values of sirona s assets and liabilities recorded in its consolidated balance sheet  the following naming convention has been used in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to distinguish between periods for which the consolidated financial statements are not prepared on a comparable basis sirona dental systems beteiligungs und verwaltungs gmbh predecessor october  june  portion of fiscal sirona dental systems  inc now parent to sirona holding gmbh successor july  september  portion of fiscal october  september  october  september  the results of operations presented for the year ended september  represent an aggregation of the results of operations for the predecessor period from october  to june  when predecessor was under the ownership of eqt  and the results of operations for the successor period from july  to september   being the period following the mdp transaction 
the results have been aggregated to provide readers with data for a full fiscal year period and to provide a basis for comparing results of operations to prior periods 
results of operations for the successor period include the effect of purchase accounting related to the mdp transaction and  therefore  are not directly comparable to data for the prior periods 
the table below sets forth sirona s results of operations for the fiscal periods presented year ended september  year ended september  year ended september  aggregated unaudited s except for per share amounts revenue    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses income selling  general and administrative expense   research and development    provision for doubtful accounts and notes receivable write off in process research and development  net other operating income expenses   operating income    foreign currency transaction gain loss   loss gain on derivative instruments  interest expense  net    loss on debt extinguishment  other income income loss before income taxes and minority interest  income tax benefit provision   minority intererst net income loss   net income per share basic n a diluted n a a reconciliation of the aggregate period results shown above to the consolidated statements of operations prepared in accordance with us gaap has been included in the table below july  to september  october  to june  year ended september  aggregated unaudited s revenue    cost of sales    gross profit    operating expenses income selling  general and administrative expense   research and development    provision for doubtful accounts and notes receivable write off in process research and development  net other operating income expenses  operating loss income    foreign currency transaction loss gain  gain loss on derivative instruments    interest expense  net    other income loss income before income taxes and minority interest  income tax benefit provision   minority intererst net loss income    the aggregation of the results of operations data for fiscal is not in accordance with us gaap  and the period presented is not comparable due to the change in basis of assets that resulted from the application of the purchase method of accounting in connection with the mdp transaction and the eqt transaction 
because predecessor and successor are different reporting entities for accounting purposes  the aggregated information should be considered as supplemental information only 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue revenue for the fiscal year ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the fiscal year ended september  on a constant currency basis  adjusting for the fluctuations in the euro rate  total revenue increased by 
growth rates were up on a constant currency basis for the imaging systems segment  up on a constant currency basis for the instruments segment  up on a constant currency basis for the cad cam systems segment  and up on a constant currency basis for the treatment center segment 
the positive imaging systems segment development in the fiscal year that ended september  was attributable to the inclusion of the schick operations for the full year  the continued adoption of digital radiography  and initial sales of the d digital panoramic imaging unit galileos  which was launched in early while sales of galileos contributed to the increase  the company has experienced a longer than expected sales cycle  as new product offerings entering the d digital marketplace have caused the dental community to take longer to evaluate all of the available options 
the instruments segment revenue increase resulted  in part from new products  such as endodontic applications  from multi unit contract sales in emerging markets and a strong performance in germany 
dental cad cam systems segment revenue growth was impacted by the launch of our new mc xl milling machine  which started shipping in march the first half of the year had negative year over year cad cam segment growth due to i challenging year over year comparisons and ii investment caution as customers held back purchases of cad cam systems in anticipation of the launch and delivery of our new milling unit 
the second half of the year had strong cad cam revenue growth as the mc xl has been well received in the marketplace 
together with our distribution partners  we implemented a trade in program for existing cerec users in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this trade in program contributed positively to our fourth quarter revenue development 
treatment center revenue was positively impacted by strong revenues in germany  china  and the middle east 
revenue growth in all segments was mainly volume driven while prices in general remained stable 
revenue in the united states for the fiscal year ended september  increased by compared to the same period last year 
this development was particularly attributable to the inclusion of the schick operations for the full fiscal year in and the continuing strong performance of the imaging systems segment  which benefited from the continued adoption of digital radiography and the first deliveries of our new d imaging unit galileos 
revenue growth outside of the united states was 
on a constant currency basis  adjusting for the fluctuations in the euro exchange rate  revenue in the rest of the world increased by 
although all regions contributed to this development  revenues were particularly strong in germany  the uk  japan  china and russia as well as in multi unit contract sales in the middle east 
cost of sales cost of sales for the fiscal year ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the fiscal year ended september  cost of sales included amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step up to fair values of tangible and intangible assets of million as well as non cash option expense of million for the fiscal year ended september   compared to amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step up to fair values of tangible and intangible assets of million and non cash option expense of million for the fiscal year ended september  the year over year increase in amortization and depreciation expense for the twelve months mainly resulted from the step up to fair values of sirona s net assets and liabilities related to the exchange 
excluding these amounts  costs of sales as a percentage of revenue decreased to for the twelve months ended september  compared with for the twelve months ended september   and gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by percentage points to from 
the gross margin development was positively impacted by the addition of schick s product lines for the full fiscal year  the launch of our d imaging unit galileos as well as strong german sales and a favorable product mix in the treatment center segment 
these positive developments were partly offset by the trade in program for the new mc xl milling unit as well as higher manufacturing costs and start up expenses 
gross profit margins were also negatively impacted by multi unit contract sales in emerging markets for the instruments segments and by variations in the us dollar euro rate as most of the expenses are denominated in euro 
selling  general and administrative for the fiscal year ended september   sg a expense was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the fiscal year ended september  sg a expense included amortization and depreciation resulting from the step up to fair values of tangible and intangible assets of million as well as non cash option expense in the amount of million for the twelve months ended september   compared with million and million  respectively  for the twelve months ended september  the year over year increase in amortization and depreciation expense reflects the step up to the fair values of certain assets resulting from the exchange 
excluding these amounts  as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased to for the fiscal year ended september  as compared with for the fiscal year ended september  the increase was primarily due to the inclusion of schick  variations in the u 
s dollar euro exchange rate as most of the expenses were denominated in euros  expenses associated with the growth in revenue and with sirona s expanded presence in various markets  including the united states  china and japan and expenses related to the new product launches 
furthermore  administration expenses included in the fiscal year ended september  costs for the preparation and audit and review of us gaap accounts as well as compliance with sarbanes oxley  which were not applicable for the full fiscal year research and development r d expense for the fiscal year ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the fiscal year ended september  r d expense included non cash stock option expense in the amount of million for the twelve months ended september   the twelve months ended september  did not include any non cash stock option expense 
excluding this amount  as a percentage of revenue  r d expense increased to for the year ended september   compared to for the year ended september  the increase in r d was primarily driven by the inclusion of the schick operations and variations in the us dollar euro exchange rates as most of the expenses were denominated in euro 
r d expenses reflect new product developments or product enhancements in all segments and branches  with particular focus on galileos and mc xl as well as expenses relating to the development of the new treatment center platform 
write off of in process research and development write off of ipr d for the year ended september  and was and million  respectively 
the write off was recorded as a result of the allocation of the acquisition purchase price for the exchange 
ipr d projects included in the amount written off primarily relate to enhancements of the intra oral sensor technology 
this charge will not have a continued impact on sirona s future results 
gain on foreign currency transactions gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended september  amounted to million compared to a gain of million for the year ended september  for the year ended september  the gain included foreign currency gain upon the repayment of the us dollar denominated bank debt of million  an unrealized non cash foreign currency gain of million on the us dollar denominated deferred income from the translation adjustment of patterson s exclusivity payment  as well as a non cash foreign currency gain on the us dollar denominated short term intra group loans to german entities of million

the gain for the year ended september  included an unrealized non cash loss of million on interest swaps  as well as a non cash gain on foreign currency hedges of million 
interest expense net interest expense for the year ended september  was million  compared to million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to the company s refinancing of its previous credit facilities on november  on more favorable terms 
in addition  interest expense for the year ended september  included interest of million on a shareholder loan which was subsequently transferred to a group entity as consideration for the exchange and has been eliminated on consolidation since june  debt extinguishment the retirement of the borrowings under the company s previous credit facilities  the senior syndicated loan tranches a  b and c and the mezzanine loan facility was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the unscheduled repayment of the mezzanine facility by the company resulted in a prepayment fee of euro million million 
in addition  million of unamortized debt issue costs relating to the previous credit facilities were written off in the period 
as a result  a loss on debt extinguishment totaling million was recognized in the year ended september  income tax benefit provision for the year ended september  and  sirona realized a profit before income taxes and minority interest of million and million  respectively 
the average actual tax rate for these years was and  which would result in a provision of million and million  respectively 
the tax benefit for income taxes for the year ended september  was million and the tax provision for the year ended september  was million 
the tax benefit for the year ended september  resulted mainly from non cash revaluations of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from an enacted tax rate reduction in germany 
these non cash revaluations of deferred tax assets and liabilities totaled million 
the tax provision for the year ended september  was adversely impacted by the non tax deductible charge related to the write off of ipr d related to the exchange 
net income sirona s net income for the year ended september  was million  an increase of million  as compared with the year ended september  as described above  sirona s net income was significantly impacted by the tax benefit of million as compared to the prior year income tax provision of million  mainly resulting from the tax rate change in the german jurisdiction  which reduced net deferred tax liabilities by million 
other major impacts result from the exchange and the mdp transaction 
for the year ended september   amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step up of fair values of intangible and tangible assets related to the exchange and mdp transaction impacted net income by million net of taxes of million as compared to million net of taxes of million in the prior year 
in addition to this effect  losses of million were recorded on debt extinguishment net of taxes of million 
furthermore  stock option expense was recorded in the amount of million net of taxes of million as compared to million net of taxes of million in the prior year 
net income also increased as result of lower interest expense due to the refinancing and increased foreign currency transaction gains 
the increase in sales was partially offset by increases in cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expense 
fiscal year ended september  compared to aggregated fiscal year ended september  revenue revenue for the year ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the year ended september  on a constant currency basis  adjusting for the fluctuations in the us dollar euro rate  total revenue increased by  which included growth rates for the imaging systems segments of  the instruments segments of  the dental cad cam systems of  and the treatment center segment of 
the imaging systems segment was driven by the trend towards increasing digitalization of dental practices  the success of the new panoramic product line orthophos xg and the inclusion beginning june  of the schick operations 
the instrument segment revenue increase was driven by new products  such as the sirolaser and siropure instruments 
the dental cad cam systems revenue benefited from the key trends in the dental industry  such as increased emphasis on efficiency and productivity  and patients growing emphasis on aesthetics 
revenue in the united states for the year ended september  increased by from the prior period 
all segments contributed to this development 
of the year over year growth in the united states was attributable to the imaging systems segment  to the dental cad cam systems segment  to the instruments segment and to the treatment center segment 
revenue growth in the rest of the world was 
on a constant currency basis  revenue in the rest of the world increased by 
the revenue growth in the rest of the world was primarily due to sirona s expanded presence in spain  australia  china and canada

this increase in gross profit was primarily due to a period over period increase in gross profit margins in all of the segments 
the improvement was attributable to economies of scale resulting from volume increases  which have in turn led to fixed cost leverage 
in addition  the improved cost position of the new panoramic product line over the predecessor product and the schick product lines  were the main drivers of the improved gross profit margin in the imaging systems segment 
selling  general and administrative for the year ended september   sg a expense was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the year ended september  sg a expense included amortization and depreciation resulting from the step up to fair values of tangible and intangible assets as well as non cash option expense in the amount of million for the year ended september   compared with million for the year ended september  the year over year increase in amortization and depreciation expense resulted from the step up to fair values of sirona s net assets and liabilities related to the exchange 
excluding these amounts  as a percentage of revenue sg a expense increased to for the year ended september   as compared with for the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with the growth in revenue and with costs associated with sirona s expanded presence in various markets  including the united states  japan  australia and china 
cost for the initial sarbanes oxley implementation in the amount of million have been included in other operating expenses 
research and development r d expense for the year ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the year ended september  as a percentage of revenue  r d remained relatively constant at for the years ended september  and september   respectively

gain loss on foreign currency transactions gain on foreign currency transactions for the year ended september  amounted to million compared to a loss of million for the year ended september  these gains and losses included an unrealized foreign currency gain and loss on us dollar denominated bank debt of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
an unrealized foreign currency gain of million on the us dollar denominated deferred income  resulting from the exclusivity payment  is also included in the year ended september  this foreign currency gain or loss resulted from translation adjustments to the carrying value of tranche a of sirona s us dollar denominated bank debt and deferred income due to currency fluctuations which did not affect cash flow 
interest expense net interest expense for the year ended september  was million  compared to million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances following the mdp transaction and includes and million of amortization of capitalized financing fees for the year ended september  and  respectively 
income tax benefit provision for the year ended september  and  sirona realized a profit and loss before income taxes and minority interest of million and million  respectively 
the average actual tax rate for these years was and  which would result in a provision and a benefit of million and million  respectively 
the tax provision for income taxes for the year ended september  was million and the tax benefit for the year ended september  was million 
the tax provision for the year ended september  was adversely impacted by foreign income for which no foreign tax credit was available and the non tax deductible charge related to the write off of ipr d related to the exchange

for the year ended september   amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step up of fair values of intangible and tangible assets related to the exchange and the mdp transaction was million net of a tax impact of million 
write off of ipr d was million with no tax impact 
in addition  the unrealized gains on the tranche a us dollar denominated bank debt as well as the deferred income from the exclusivity payment was million net of a tax impact of million and option expenses were million net of a tax impact of million 
excluding these items in both periods  net income increased due to higher revenue and improved gross margins  partially offset by higher sg a  r d and interest expense 
liquidity and capital resources historically  sirona s principal uses of cash  apart from operating requirements  including research and development expenses  have been for interest payments  debt repayment and acquisitions 
operating capital expenditures are approximately equal to operating depreciation excluding any effects from the increased amortization and depreciation expense resulting from the step up to fair values of sirona s and schick s assets and liabilities required under purchase accounting 
sirona s management believes that sirona s working capital is sufficient for its present requirements 
successor predecessor year ended september  year ended september  july  to september  october  to june  year ended september  aggregated unaudited s net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities  increase decrease in cash during the period   net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities represents net cash from operations  returns on investments  and payments for interest and taxation 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended september  compared to million for the fiscal year ended september   and million for the year ended september  the primary contributing factors to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities were i income tax payments in the amount of million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   ii accreted interest paid on the repayment of debt in connection with the refinancing in november in the amount of million  and iii the increase of inventories due to the ramp up for new product launches and acquisitions 
income tax payments in the year ended september  were made in relation to taxes for prior year periods  which had been accrued at the end of fiscal year  and for prepayments for fiscal year in sirona received a one time payment of million for an exclusivity agreement for dental cad cam systems with sirona s distribution partner  patterson dental inc  for sales in the united states and canada 
excluding this amount the cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and remained nearly unchanged 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities represents cash used for capital expenditures  financial investments  acquisitions and long lived asset disposals 
the primary contributors to the investing cash outflow in the periods presented are capital expenditures in the course of normal operating activities and the cash effect from two acquisitions in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended september   compared to million for the year ended september   and million for the year ended september  the primary contributors to the investing cash outflow in fiscal year were i investments in special tools and software developed for sale  related to product launches  ii leasehold improvements for the company s new office building in bensheim  and iii the acquisition of an imaging systems manufacturer and a sales and service company with million 
the primary contributor to the investing cash inflow in fiscal year was the exchange with million  offset by capital expenditures of million primarily related to property  plant and equipment and software developed for sale 
the primary contributors to the investing cash outflow in the twelve months period that ended on september  were i the mdp transaction of million  ii the deferred purchase price payment in december of million related to the eqt transaction  and iii capital expenditures of million 
net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended september  compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended september  and net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended september  the cash used in financing activities in fiscal reflected the refinancing of the company s prior credit facilities as of november  and the utilization of the company s revolving credit facility in the period 
cash used in financing activities in fiscal comprised unscheduled prepayments of the mezzanine loan million or million as well as tranche c million or million and unscheduled and scheduled prepayments of tranche a million of the senior facility loan 
the cash provided by financing activities in the twelve months ended september  reflected the refinancing of sirona s debt to effect the mdp transaction 
this refinancing resulted in full repayment of sirona s existing bank debt and shareholder loans and proceeds generated from new debt 
as a result of the mdp transaction  sirona s debt substantially increased 
sirona believes that its operating cash flows and available cash including restricted cash  together with its long term debt borrowings  will be sufficient to fund its working capital needs  research and development expenses including but not limited to the acquired in process research and development anticipated capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
other financial data unaudited successor predecessor year ended september  year ended september  july  to september  october  to june  s net income loss    net interest expense     benefit provision for income taxes    depreciation     amortization     ebitda     ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is reconciled to net income  its most directly comparable us gaap measure  in the accompanying financial tables 
ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
sirona s management utilizes ebitda as an operating performance measure in conjunction with us gaap measures  such as net income and gross margin calculated in conformity with us gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with us gaap 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to sirona s earnings to calculate ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure 
for instance  ebitda does not include interest expense  and because sirona has borrowed money in order to finance its operations  interest expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and because sirona uses capital and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  and tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of sirona s operations  tax expense is a necessary element of costs and impacts sirona s ability to operate 
in addition  other companies may define ebitda differently 
ebitda  as well as the other information in this filing  should be read in conjunction with sirona s consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
in addition to ebitda  the accompanying financial tables also set forth certain supplementary information that sirona believes is useful for investors in evaluating sirona s underlying operations

off balance sheet arrangements customers can finance their purchases of sirona products from their respective dealer through financial institutions 
prior to march  sirona offered to guarantee up to of the total liability due to the financial institution from the customer in the event the customer defaulted on their payments 
however  the contracts negotiated with the dealers  who sold the products to the third party customers  granted sirona a right of recourse against the dealer in such event 
sirona ceased issuing these guarantees after march the arrangements were generally provided for a five year period and therefore the related guarantees issued by sirona are expected to expire by at september  and  the maximum potential amount of future undiscounted payments that could be required to be made was million and million  respectively 
however  these amounts may be recovered from dealers pursuant to the recourse arrangements described above 
no related asset or liability has been recorded in sirona s consolidated financial statements as of september  or in july  sirona entered into a sale and leaseback agreement regarding unused land on the bensheim site of sirona in germany 
the land was sold for million million at the exchange rate of september  to an unrelated property development company  who constructed an office building based on sirona s specifications on the site 
sirona leased the building from the property development company through an year lease 
rental payments started in april when the building was ready for occupancy 
under the terms of the lease  rent is fixed at million million at the exchange rate of september  per annum until after  rent is subject to adjustment according to an inflation index 
the land remains an asset on sirona s balance sheet and the building has been accounted for as an operating lease 
sirona has no other off balance sheet financing arrangements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires sirona to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information sirona believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to sirona s estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in its estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the following accounting policies are those that sirona believes to be the most sensitive to its estimates and assumptions 
revenue recognition sirona recognizes revenue  net of related discounts and allowances  when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms 
returns of products  excluding warranty related returns  are infrequent and insignificant 
revenue related to products that contain software which is more than incidental to the product is recognized in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
for orders which contain one or more elements to be delivered at a future date  but do not include software that is more than incidental to the other elements  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
for revenue on certain cerec and galileos units recognized in accordance with both sop and eitf  the company allocates revenues between the various elements using the relative fair value method because evidence of fair value exists for all elements 
under the relative fair value method  as applied by the company  the revenue is allocated between the elements of the arrangement in proportion to the fair value of each element 
the revenue allocated to the service contract is deferred until the service is provided 
the revenue allocated to the cerec or galileos product sold  which contains software and hardware the functionality of which is dependent on the software and for which the software is integral ie  software related hardware  is recognized as revenue upon transfer of the risk and rewards of ownership 
the fair value of the product and the service contract is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers or based on the renewal rate of the service contract 
the company offers its customers an option to purchase extended warranties on certain products 
the company recognizes revenue on these extended warranty contracts ratably over the life of the contract 
the costs associated with these extended warranty contracts are recognized when incurred 
the company offers discounts to its distributors if certain conditions are met 
discounts and allowances are primarily based on the volume of products purchased or targeted to be purchased by the individual customer or distributor 
discounts are deducted from revenue at the time of sale or when the discount is granted  whichever is later 
the company estimates volume discounts based on the individual customer s historical and estimated future product purchases 
amounts received from customers in advance of product shipment are classified as deferred income until the revenue can be recognized in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy 
pensions and k plan sirona has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  as well as an early retirement plan 
as of september   the company adopted the recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
this standard requires employers to fully recognize the obligations associated with single employer defined benefit pension plans in their financial statements 
in detail sfas requires an employer to recognize on its balance sheet the funded status of a benefit plan measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and the benefit obligation as of the end of the employer s fiscal year 
changes in the funded status will be recognized in other comprehensive income until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
the adjustments to adopt sfas were recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the impact due to the adoption of sfas as of september  is summarized in the following table and reflects the recognition of the unrecognized actuarial gains as of september  within accumulated other comprehensive income  net of related tax effect before application of statement adjustments after application of statement s deferred tax assets non current    total assets    liability for pension benefits    total liabilities    accumulated other comprehensive income    total stockholders equity    pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employee s approximate service periods 
defined benefit pension costs are determined by using an actuarial method  which provides for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses in excess of a specified corridor that result from changes in assumptions or actual experience differing from that assumed 
costs relating to changes in the benefit plan as well as the transition obligation are amortized 
disclosure of the components of periodic pension cost is also required 
when purchase accounting is applied  pension liabilities are recognized for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 
the key assumption used in the actuarial calculations for the defined benefit pension plans is the selection of the appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate has been selected by reference to market interest rates 
the discount rate used reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income investment of appropriate duration at the measurement dates of each year 
fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the discount rate assumption changed from at september  to at september  thereby affecting the amount of pension expense recorded during each period 
plan assets consist of contributions made by sirona to a pension support fund of an insurance company  the custodian  which in turn invests these contributions 
the insurance company guarantees the employees the investments will generate a minimum return of 
the plan assets are invested in equity securities  fixed income securities and other assets 
as of september  there were actuarial gains that will be amortized through the corridor approach method during the years of service remaining beginning fiscal year the reasons for the appearance of these gains are the increase of the retirement age in germany and the increase of the discount rate 
contributions made to the defined contribution pension plans and the k savings plan for us employees are accrued based on the contributions required by the plan 
sirona also has an early retirement plan  altersteilzeit atz which allows certain german employees who have been accepted into the plan to retire at rather than at the legal retirement age 
eligible employees are those who have attained the age of or who will attain the age of by calendar year and have been accepted to participate in the atz plan 
the atz plan can cover a period between the ages of to of the participating employees and is split into an active service period  where the employees work full time for sirona  and an inactive service period  where the employees do not work for the company 
during the active service period  the employees receive of their salary and the remaining of their salary  plus a bonus payment equal to of their salary is paid during the inactive service period 
sirona recognizes the salary component of the atz plan over the period from the beginning of the atz period to the end of the active service period 
sirona recognizes the bonus component over the period from the point at which the employee signs the atz contract until the end of the active service period 
income taxes sirona recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
sirona regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance  as necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if sirona is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  it could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   sirona had recorded valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
further information on income taxes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
impairment of long lived and finite lived assets sirona assesses all its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
sirona s management assesses whether there has been an impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of the asset 
the factors considered by sirona s management in this assessment include operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
if an impairment is deemed to exist  management records an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of indefinite lived assets sirona tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying values 
key assumptions in determining fair value are the assessment of future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value requires a fair value exercise similar to a business combination where the individual assets and liabilities are valued at fair value with the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit being the implied fair value of goodwill 
sirona evaluates trademarks  which are considered indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value might be impaired 
in performing this assessment  sirona s management considers operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
the carrying value of trademarks is considered impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
in such an event  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount of that excess 
key assumptions in determining fair value include using the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
purchase accounting sirona has recorded a change in basis of the assets and liabilities acquired in the exchange  the mdp transaction and eqt transaction 
these transactions required the assets and liabilities to be recorded either at partial fair value or fair value as described in notes and to sirona s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this document 
in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities  sirona is required to make certain key assumptions that could materially impact the value of the assets or liabilities recorded 
in valuing the intangible assets  the key assumptions include the valuation method selected  the cash flow projections  the risk based discount rate  the replacement costs and or the applicable royalty rates 
sirona used its historical experience  budgets and similar assumptions used in the medical devices industry in formulating these assumptions 
in valuing property  plant and equipment  the fair values were derived from posted values for comparable assets and replacement values 
fair value of liabilities was determined to be equivalent to the predecessors carrying value or acquired company s fair value except for pension obligations  which were valued at the project benefit obligation measured in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
among other requirements  sfas defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and also expands disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas prescribes a single definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective beginning the first fiscal year that begins after november  the company is still determining the effect sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements  but it currently does not expect the effect to be material 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits measurement of recognized financial assets and liabilities at fair value with some certain exceptions such as investments in subsidiaries  obligations for pension or other postretirement benefits  and financial assets and financial liabilities recognized under leases 
changes in the fair value of items for which the fair value option is elected should be recognized in income or loss 
the election to measure eligible items at fair value is irrevocable and can only be made at defined election dates or events  generally on an instrument by instrument basis 
items for which the fair value option is elected should be separately presented or parenthetically be disclosed in the statement of financial position 
sfas also requires significant new disclosures that apply for interim and annual financial statements 
sfas shall be effective for fiscal years beginning after november  with earlier adoption permitted  if certain conditions are met 
the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value of eligible items existing will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the date of adoption 
the company is currently evaluating sfas and determining whether to elect the fair value option for certain financial assets and liabilities 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which is an interpretation of fasb statement  accounting for income taxes 
fin requires management to perform a two step evaluation of all tax positions  ensuring that these tax return positions meet the more likely than not recognition threshold and can be measured with sufficient precision to determine the benefit recognized in the financial statements 
these evaluations provide management with a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements certain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on income tax returns 
fin is effective for the company s fiscal year ending september  the company is still determining the effect fin will have on its consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk sirona s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk associated with short and long term bank loans bearing variable interest rates 
to manage this interest rate risk exposure  sirona enters into interest rate swap agreements 
sirona is also exposed to foreign currency risk  which can adversely affect our sales and operating profits 
to manage this risk  sirona enters into forward exchange contracts 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with notes and to sirona s audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  which provide further information on sirona s derivative instruments 
interest rate sensitivity to reduce the exposure associated with sirona s variable rate debt  sirona has entered into interest rate swap agreements that limit the variable rate for portions of the bank loans 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations long term debt for further details 
as of september   the interest rate swaps had notional amounts of million and a fair value of million 
the variable benchmark interest rates associated with these instruments ranged from to 
a hypothetical  instantaneous increase of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to the variable interest rate debt would have increased the interest expense for the year ended september  by approximately million 
exchange rate sensitivity the euro is the functional currency for the majority of sirona s subsidiaries  including its german operations  which are the primary sales and manufacturing operations of sirona 
sales from other sirona operations are denominated in various foreign currencies 
sales in euro  us dollar and other currencies represented  and  respectively  of total sales for fiscal in order to hedge portions of the transactional exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro  based on forecasted and firmly committed cash flows  sirona enters into forward foreign currency different from functional currency contracts 
these forward foreign currency contracts are intended to protect sirona against the short term effects of changes in the exchange rates 
sirona does not apply hedge accounting to these forward foreign currency contracts 
the table below provides information  as of september   about receivables and derivative financial instruments by functional currency and presents such information in us dollars  which is sirona s reporting currency 
the table summarizes information on instruments and transactions that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
the estimated fair value of receivables is considered to approximate their carrying value because receivables have a short maturity 
for foreign currency forward exchange agreements  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected contractual maturity dates 
these notional amounts generally are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract
