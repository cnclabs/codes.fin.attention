overview the company operates in the truckload sector of the trucking industry  with a focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that ship more consistently throughout the year 
the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
operating revenues consist of trucking revenues generated by the six operating fleets in the truckload transportation services segment dedicated  medium long haul van  regional short haul  expedited  flatbed  and temperature controlled and non trucking revenues generated primarily by the company s vas segment 
the company s truckload transportation services segment truckload segment also includes a small amount of non trucking revenues for the portion of shipments delivered to or from mexico where it utilizes a third party capacity provider  and for a few of its dedicated accounts where the services of third party capacity providers are used to meet customer capacity requirements 
non trucking revenues reported in the operating statistics table include those revenues generated by the vas segment  as well as the non trucking revenues generated by the truckload segment 
trucking revenues accounted for of total operating revenues in  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for 
trucking services typically generate revenues on a per mile basis 
other sources of trucking revenues include fuel surcharges and accessorial revenues such as stop charges  loading unloading charges  and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in the cost of fuel  these revenues are identified separately within the operating statistics table and are excluded from the statistics to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
non trucking revenues generated by a fleet whose operations are part of the truckload segment are included in non trucking revenues in the operating statistics table so that the revenue statistics in the table are calculated using only the revenues generated by the company owned and owner operator trucks 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues  excluding fuel surcharges  are average revenues per tractor per week  the per mile rates charged to customers  the average monthly miles generated per tractor  the percentage of empty miles  the average trip length  and the average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal freight patterns in the trucking industry  and industry capacity are key factors that impact these statistics 
the company s most significant resource requirements are company drivers  owner operators  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers that recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  there is no assurance that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used revenue equipment 
because the company is self insured for a significant portion of personal injury  property damage  and cargo claims and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
a common industry measure used to evaluate the profitability of the company and its trucking operating fleets is the operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the trucking operation are driver salaries and benefits  payments to owner operators included in rent and purchased transportation expense  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  supplies and maintenance  and insurance and claims 
generally  these expenses vary based on the number of miles generated 
as such  the company also evaluates these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers  and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues  including volatile fuel prices and a challenging driver recruiting and retention market  could cause costs to increase in future periods 
the company s main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
depreciation expense has been affected by the new engine emission standards that became effective in october for all newly purchased trucks  which have increased truck purchase costs 
in addition  beginning in january  a new set of more stringent engine emissions standards mandated by the epa became effective for all newly manufactured trucks 
the company expects that the engines produced under the standards will be less fuel efficient and have a higher cost than the current engines 
the trucking operations require substantial cash expenditures for the purchase of tractors and trailers 
in and  the company accelerated its normal three year replacement cycle for company owned tractors 
these purchases were funded by net cash from operations and financing available under the company s existing credit facilities  as management deemed necessary 
capital expenditures for tractors in are expected to be substantially lower 
non trucking services provided by the company  primarily through its vas division  include freight management single source logistics  truck brokerage  and intermodal  as well as a newly expanded international product line  as discussed further on page unlike the company s trucking operations  the non trucking operations are less asset intensive and are instead dependent upon qualified employees  information systems  and the services of qualified third party capacity providers 
the most significant expense item related to these non trucking services is the cost of transportation paid by the company to third party capacity providers  which is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other expenses include salaries  wages and benefits and computer hardware and software depreciation 
the company evaluates the non trucking operations by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating income percentage 
the operating income percentage for the non trucking business is lower than those of the trucking operations  but the return on assets is substantially higher

higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge collections have the effect of increasing the company s consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses 
eliminating fuel surcharge revenues  which are generally a more volatile source of revenue  provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  offset by a decrease in average annual miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market was softer during much of  particularly from mid august through december when the normal peak seasonal increase in freight volume did not occur 
additionally  the significant industry wide accelerated purchase of new trucks in advance of the new emissions standards contributed to excess truck capacity that partially disrupted the supply and demand balance in the second half of the combination of these factors resulted in the decrease in annual miles per tractor and also negatively affected revenues per total mile 
while revenues per total mile increased year over year  the percentage increase over the comparable periods was lower in the last two quarters of than in the first two quarters of most of the revenues per total mile increase is due to base rate increases negotiated with customers  offset by an increase in the empty mile percentage 
a substantial portion of the company s freight base is under contract with customers and provides for annual pricing increases  with much of the company s non dedicated contractual business renewing in the latter part of third quarter and fourth quarter 
the challenging freight market in the second half of made it much more difficult for the company to obtain base rate increases at levels comparable to the and renewal periods 
there continue to be several inflationary cost pressures that are impacting truckload carriers 
they include driver pay and other driver related costs  volatile diesel fuel prices  conversion from low sulfur diesel fuel to ulsd  and new engine emission requirements for newly manufactured trucks beginning in january that are increasing the truck purchase costs and lowering the mpg 
the average percentage of empty miles increased to in from in the increase in the empty mile percentage is partially the result of a higher percentage of dedicated trucks in the fleet and a higher percentage of regional shipments with a shorter length of haul 
over the past few years  werner has grown its dedicated fleets  arrangements in which the company provides trucks and or trailers for the exclusive use of a specific customer 
for almost all the company s dedicated fleet arrangements  dedicated customers pay the company on an all miles basis loaded or empty to obtain guaranteed truck and or trailer capacity 
for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  werner classifies a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile ie  deadhead mile 
since dedicated fleets generally have a higher percentage of miles without cargo in the trailer and since the company has been growing its dedicated fleet business  this contributed to an increase in the company s reported average empty mile percentage 
excluding the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be in and in fuel surcharge revenues  which represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel  increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on the company s margins  the company collects fuel surcharge revenues from its customers 
the company s fuel surcharge programs are designed to recoup the higher cost of fuel from customers when fuel prices rise and provide customers with the benefit of lower costs when fuel prices decline 
the truckload industry s fuel surcharge standard is a one cent per mile increase in rate for every five cent per gallon increase in the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices that are used for most fuel surcharge programs 
these programs have historically enabled the company to recover approximately to of the fuel price increases 
the remaining to is generally not recoverable  due to empty miles not billable to customers  out of route miles  truck idle time  and the volatility in fuel prices as prices change rapidly in short periods of time 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in  and gross margin increased for the same period 
vas revenues consist primarily of truck brokerage  intermodal  freight management single source logistics  as well as the newly expanded international product line described below 
most of the revenue growth came from the company s brokerage and intermodal divisions within vas 
brokerage continued to grow rapidly  achieving nearly million of revenues in freight management recently attracted several new single source customers that are being added during first quarter the company continues to focus on growing the volume of business in this segment  which provides customers with additional sources of capacity 
in july  the company formed wgl  a separate company that operates within the vas segment  and through its subsidiaries established its wofe headquartered in shanghai  china 
werner is one of the first us companies to receive a combined approval to conduct comprehensive forwarding and logistics business  nationwide import export  and wholesale and commission agency business 
wgl and its subsidiaries obtained business licenses to operate as an ocean transport intermediary nvocc and ocean freight forwarder  us customs broker  and class a freight forwarder in china 
in addition  in first quarter wgl entered into the air freight forwarding business 
analysis and optimization work prepared for key partner customers has resulted in multiple door to door business awards being managed by the company  primarily in the trans pacific trade lanes 
current service offerings within china include site selection analysis  purchase order and vendor management  origin consolidation  warehousing  freight forwarding and customs brokerage 
these services are being provided through a combination of strategic alliances with best in class providers and company owned assets 
the company expects wgl to be a more meaningful revenue contributor in operating expenses the company s operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues was in versus in as explained on page  the significant increase in fuel expense and recording the related fuel surcharge revenues on a gross basis had the effect of increasing the operating ratio 
because the company s vas business operates with a lower operating margin than the trucking business  the growth in vas business in compared to also increased the company s overall operating ratio

owner operator costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including fuel  supplies and maintenance  and fuel taxes 
this decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs determined on a total mile basis from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
the company estimates that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was lower by approximately cent per total mile due to this decrease  and other expense categories had offsetting increases on a total mile basis  as follows salaries  wages and benefits cents  fuel cents  supplies and maintenance cent  taxes and licenses cent  and depreciation cent 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to due to a larger number of employees required to support the growth in the vas segment 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload segment is primarily due to higher driver pay per mile resulting from an increase in the percentage of company truck miles versus owner operator miles see above  an increase in the percentage of dedicated fleet trucks  additional amounts paid to drivers to help offset the impact of lower miles in a softer freight market  and higher group health insurance costs  offset by a decrease in workers compensation expense 
non driver salaries  wages and benefits increased due to an increase in the number of equipment maintenance personnel and  as described further below  million of stock compensation expense related to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

the driver recruiting and retention market remains challenging 
after two quarters of sequential decreases in average tractors in service during the first half of  the company s ongoing focus to lower driver turnover yielded positive results in the second half of the year 
the improvements in the latter part of the year offset the decreases experienced during the first half of the year  resulting in essentially no change in average tractors in compared to the company anticipates that the competition for drivers will continue to be high and cannot predict whether it will experience shortages in the future 
if such a shortage were to occur and additional increases in driver pay rates were necessary to attract and retain drivers  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents a gallon  or  higher than in higher net fuel costs had a four cent negative impact on earnings per share in compared to the company includes all of the following items in the calculation of the impact of fuel on earnings for both periods average fuel price per gallon  fuel reimbursements paid to owner operator drivers  lower mpg due to the year over year increase in the percentage of the company owned truck fleet with post october engines and the mpg impact of ultra low sulfur diesel fuel  and offsetting fuel surcharge revenues from customers 
during third quarter  truckload carriers transitioned a gradually increasing portion of their diesel fuel consumption from low sulfur diesel fuel to ulsd fuel  as fuel refiners were required to meet the epa mandated ulsd threshold by the transition date of october  preliminary estimates were that ulsd would result in a degradation in mpg for all trucks  due to the lower energy content btu of ulsd 
based on the company s fuel mpg experience to date  these preliminary mpg degradation estimates appear to be accurate 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices  or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on the operations and profitability of the company 
the company is unable to predict whether fuel price levels will continue to increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis  primarily related to higher negative development on existing liability insurance claims and an increase in larger claims 
the company renewed its liability insurance policies on august  see item legal proceedings for information on the company s coverage levels for personal injury and property damage since august  the company s liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  were slightly higher than the previous policy year 
the company is unable to predict whether the trend of increasing insurance and claims expense will continue in the future 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to higher costs of new tractors with the post october engines  the impact of fewer average miles per truck  and a higher percentage of company owned trucks versus owner operators 
as of december   nearly of the company owned truck fleet consisted of trucks with the post october engines  compared to at december  rent and purchased transportation consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the trucking operations 
as shown in the vas statistics table under the results of operations heading on page  rent and purchased transportation expense for the vas segment increased in response to higher vas revenues 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense increased to in compared to in intermodal s gross profits and operating income were lower due to a softer freight market and the impact of higher fixed costs and repositioning costs 
several significant changes to the intermodal operating strategy have been implemented and are expected to help intermodal achieve improved results in compared to rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in higher fuel prices necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel million in compared to million in  which resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
the company also increased the van and regional over the road owner operators settlement rate by two cents per mile effective may  these increases were offset by the decrease in the number of owner operator trucks and the corresponding decrease in owner operator miles 
the company s customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned trucks and miles generated by owner operator trucks  thus  the increase in owner operator fuel reimbursements is included with company fuel expenses in calculating the per share impact of higher fuel costs on earnings 
the company continues to experience difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operator drivers because of challenging operating conditions including inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of the owner operators 
the company has historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decreases in owner operators 
if a shortage of owner operators and company drivers were to occur and increases in per mile settlement rates became necessary to attract and retain owner operators  the company s results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
payments to third party capacity providers used for portions of shipments delivered to or from mexico and by a few dedicated fleets in the truckload segment decreased by cents per mile  partially offsetting the overall increase for the truckload segment 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets  primarily trucks and trailers  are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses  including costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets increased to million in from million in during the company began selling its oldest van trailers that had reached the end of their depreciable life  which increased gains in the number of trucks sold in and the average gain per truck sold before costs to prepare the equipment for sale both decreased slightly in comparison to the company spent less on repairs per truck sold in as compared to  which also contributed to the improvement in gains on sale 
the company s wholly owned used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the largest class truck sales entities in the united states  with locations  and has been in operation since fleet truck sales continues to be a resource for the company to remarket its used trucks 
the company expects gains on sales will be lower in compared to due to fewer trucks available for sale by the company 
however  the company expects to continue to realize gains on the sale of its fully depreciated trailers in other operating expenses also include bad debt expense  which included an additional million of bad debt expense recorded in first quarter related to the bankruptcy of one of the company s customers  apx logistics  inc  and professional service fees 
the company recorded million of interest expense in versus million of interest expense in the company had million of debt outstanding at december   which was incurred in the second half of for the purchase of new trucks  and had million of debt outstanding at december  the company repaid the million of debt in first quarter interest income for the company increased to million in from million in due to improved interest rates  partially offset by a declining cash balance throughout the company s effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes was for versus for  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  and a increase in the average number of tractors in service  offset by a decrease in average annual miles per tractor 
average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  increased due to customer rate increases  and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the average loaded trip length 
the truckload freight environment was solid during due to ongoing truck capacity constraints 
in comparison to  demand in the months of march to august was not as strong as the strong freight market of  but freight demand for the remaining months of the year was comparable to the demand in the same periods of the average percentage of empty miles increased to in from in the increase in the empty mile percentage was partially the result of a higher percentage of dedicated trucks in the fleet and a higher percentage of regional shipments with a shorter length of haul 
over the past few years  werner has grown its dedicated fleets  arrangements in which the company provides trucks and or trailers for the exclusive use of a specific customer 
excluding the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would have been substantially lower for and fuel surcharge revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in  which enabled the company to recover a significant portion of the fuel price increases

owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in because the change in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles was only minimal  there was essentially no shift in costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
during  attracting and retaining owner operator drivers was very difficult due to high fuel prices and other factors 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to to support the growth in the vas segment 
the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload segment is primarily the result of increased student driver pay  higher driver pay per mile  and an increase in the number of maintenance employees 
because of the challenging driver recruiting and retention market  discussed below  the company trained more student drivers as an alternative source of drivers 
on august   the company s previously announced two cent per mile pay raise became effective for company solo drivers in its medium to long haul van division  representing approximately of total company drivers 
the company recovered this pay raise through its customer rate increase negotiations  which occurred in third and fourth quarter the driver recruiting and retention market remained extremely challenging during the supply of truck drivers continued to be constrained due to alternative jobs to truck driving and inadequate demographic growth for the industry s targeted driver base over the next several years 
the company continued to focus on driver quality of life issues such as developing more driving jobs with more frequent home time  providing drivers with newer trucks  and maximizing mileage productivity within the federal hours of service regulations 
the company also placed more emphasis on training drivers 
improved driver recruiting has offset higher driver turnover 
the company instituted an optional per diem reimbursement program for eligible company drivers beginning in april this program increases a company driver s net pay per mile  after taxes 
as a result of more drivers electing to participate in the per diem program  driver pay per mile was slightly lower before considering the factors above that increased driver pay per mile  and the company s effective income tax rate was higher in compared to the program was designed to be cost neutral  because the combined driver pay rate per mile and per diem reimbursement under the per diem program is about one cent per mile lower than mileage pay without per diem reimbursement  which offsets the company s increased income taxes caused by the nondeductible portion of the per diem 
the per diem program increases a company driver s net pay per mile  after taxes 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents a gallon  or  higher than in higher fuel costs  after considering the amounts collected from customers through fuel surcharge programs and the cost impact of owner operator fuel reimbursements and lower fuel mpg due to truck engine emissions changes  had a ten cent negative impact on earnings per share in compared to as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to increases in repair expenses for an increased number of trucks sold by the company s fleet truck sales subsidiary and higher costs to maintain the company s trailer fleet 
higher driver recruiting costs including driver advertising  transportation and lodging and higher toll expense related to state toll rate increases also contributed to a smaller portion of the increase 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile due primarily to the effect of the fuel mpg degradation for company owned trucks with post october engines on the per mile cost of federal and state diesel fuel taxes  as well as increases in some state tax rates 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis  primarily related to higher negative development on existing liability insurance claims 
cargo claims expense was essentially flat on a per mile basis compared to the company renewed its liability insurance policies on august  see item legal proceedings for information on the company s coverage levels for personal injury and property damage since august  liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  were approximately the same as the previous policy year 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in due primarily to higher costs of new tractors with the post october engines 
as of december   approximately of the company owned truck fleet consisted of trucks with the post october engines  compared to at december  rent and purchased transportation consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the trucking operations 
as shown in the vas statistics table under the results of operations heading on page  rent and purchased transportation expense for the vas segment increased in response to higher vas revenues 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in  resulting in a higher gross margin in as the truck capacity market tightened during  it became more difficult to find qualified truckload capacity to meet vas customer freight needs  especially in the latter part of the year 
however  the company s marketing efforts continued to successfully expand its vas qualified carrier base in a constrained capacity market  ending the year with  qualified broker carriers 
during fourth quarter  vas expanded its small  but growing  intermodal presence by agreeing to manage a fleet of union pacific owned containers for intermodal freight shipments 
the company pays a daily fee per container to union pacific up for any days that the containers are not in transit in the up network 
as of december  vas intermodal managed up containers 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in higher fuel prices necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel  which resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
the company has experienced difficulty recruiting and retaining owner operators for over three years because of challenging operating conditions 
this resulted in a reduction in the number of owner operator tractors to as of december  from as of december  payments to third party capacity providers used for portions of shipments delivered to or from mexico and by a few dedicated fleets in the truckload segment decreased by cents per mile  partially offsetting the overall increase for the truckload segment 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets  primarily trucks  increased to million in from million in  due to increased unit sales  partially offset by an increased ratio of traded trucks to sold trucks 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees 
the remaining decrease in other operating expenses in was due primarily to a reduction in computer consulting fees as consultants were hired by the company  resulting in a reduction in other operating expense  but an increase in salaries  wages and benefits expense 
the company recorded million of interest expense in versus virtually no interest expense in the company incurred debt of million during the fourth quarter of and had no debt outstanding throughout interest income for the company increased to million in from million in due to improved interest rates  partially offset by a declining cash balance throughout the company s effective income tax rate increased to in from in  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the income tax rate increased in because of higher non deductible expenses for tax purposes related to the implementation of a per diem pay program for student drivers in fourth quarter and a per diem pay program for eligible company drivers in april liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   the company generated cash flow from operations of million  a increase million  in cash flow compared to the year ended december  the increase in cash flow from operations is due primarily to lower income tax payments during  higher payables for revenue equipment of million  and improved collections of accounts receivable 
in addition  the company wrote off a million receivable related to the apx logistics  inc bankruptcy during  resulting in a decrease in net accounts receivable 
income taxes paid during totaled million compared to million in and million in the higher tax payments in were related to tax law changes that resulted in the reversal of certain tax strategies implemented in and the effect of lower income tax depreciation in due to the bonus tax depreciation provision that expired on december  the company made federal income tax payments of million related to the reversal of the tax strategies in second quarter cash flow from operations decreased million in compared to  or  due to the larger federal income tax payments in and an increase in days sales in accounts receivable  offset by higher depreciation expense for financial reporting purposes related to the higher cost of the post october engines and higher net income 
the cash flow from operations and existing cash balances  supplemented by net borrowings under its existing credit facilities  enabled the company to make net capital expenditures  repurchase stock  and pay dividends as discussed below 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in from million in net property additions  primarily revenue equipment  were million for the year ended december  versus million during the same period of the decrease was due primarily to the company purchasing more tractors in as it began to reduce the average age of its truck fleet and purchasing fewer tractors and selling more trailers in the million  or  increase in investing cash flows from to was also due to the larger number of tractors purchased 
the average age of the company s truck fleet is years at december  the company brought down the age of its truck fleet to delay the cost impact of the federally mandated engine emission standards that became effective in january the company s net capital expenditures are expected to be much lower in  or between million and million 
the company intends to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and financing available under the company s existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary

per share beginning with the dividend paid in july and the dividend paid in july financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in  million in  and million in from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of its common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
on april   the company s board of directors approved its current authorization for common stock repurchases of  shares 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to this authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes the company s financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   the company had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of stockholders equity 
as of december   the company had million of credit pursuant to credit facilities  of which it had borrowed million 
the remaining million of credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the million in letters of credit the company maintains 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies 
as of december   the company had no non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases  and therefore  had no off balance sheet revenue equipment debt 
based on the company s strong financial position  management foresees no significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  caption payments due by period in millions over total less than year years years years 
del contractual obligations long term debt  including current maturities equipment purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations other financing commitments unused lines of credit standby letters of credit total financing commitments total obligations del 
the company has committed credit facilities with two banks totaling million  of which it had borrowed million 
these credit facilities bear variable interest at december  based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
the credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit the company maintains 
the unused lines of credit are available to the company in the event the company needs financing for the growth of its fleet 
with the company s strong financial position  the company expects it could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the equipment purchase commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have arrangements that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies the company s success depends on its ability to efficiently manage its resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to its customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
the company s ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficiently deploying resources and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although the company s business volume is not highly concentrated  the company may also be affected by the financial failure of its customers or a loss of a customer s business from time to time 
the company s most significant resource requirements are qualified drivers  tractors  trailers  and related costs of operating its equipment such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance  and supplies and maintenance 
the company has historically been successful mitigating its risk to increases in fuel prices by recovering additional fuel surcharges from its customers 
the company s financial results are also affected by availability of drivers and the market for new and used trucks 
because the company is self insured for a significant portion of its personal injury  property damage  and cargo claims and for workers compensation benefits for its employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  the legal and regulatory environment  and the costs of insurance coverage to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
although the company s normal replacement cycle for tractors is three years  the company calculates depreciation expense for financial reporting purposes using a five year life and salvage value 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner continues at the same straight line rate  which approximates the continuing declining market value of the tractors  in those instances in which a tractor is held beyond the normal three year age 
calculating depreciation expense using a five year life and salvage value results in the same annual depreciation rate of cost per year and the same net book value at the normal three year replacement date of cost as using a three year life and salvage value 
the company continually monitors the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjusts these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable  and it exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  if the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows  it is not recoverable 
the company does not separately identify assets by operating segment  as tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of the company s long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all assets of the company 
long lived assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and long term are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
the company s self insurance reserves are reviewed by an actuary every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider including owner operator drivers under contract with the company is utilized to provide some or all of the service and the company is the primary obligor in regards to the delivery of the shipment  establishes customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  generally has discretion in carrier selection  and or has credit risk on the shipment  the company records both revenues for the dollar value of services billed by the company to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for the costs of transportation paid by the company to the third party provider upon delivery of the shipment 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  the company records revenues net of expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes and to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed to be necessary due to the company s profitable operations 
accordingly  if the facts or financial circumstances were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  judgment would need to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on the company s operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation could cause interest rates  fuel  wages  and other costs to increase and could adversely affect the company s results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest  commodity prices  and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  the interest rates on the variable rate debt are based on the libor 
assuming this level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the libor interest rate would increase the company s annual interest expense by  as of december   the company has no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather  and other market factors 
historically  the company has been able to recover a significant portion of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
the company has implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of its revenue base to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon 
the company cannot predict the extent to which higher fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   the company had no derivative financial instruments to reduce its exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in mexico and canada and is beginning operations in asia 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to the company s results of operations for and prior years 
to date  virtually all foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and the company receives payment for foreign freight services primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk 
accordingly  the company is not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on the company s future costs or on future cash flows
