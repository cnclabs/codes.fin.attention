item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview first community corporation is a one bank holding company headquartered in lexington  south carolina 
we operate from our main office in lexington  south carolina and our full service offices are located in lexington two  forest acres  irmo  cayce west columbia  gilbert  chapin  northeast columbia  prosperity  newberry two and camden 
during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisition of dekalb bankshares  inc  the holding company for the bank of camden 
the merger added one office in kershaw county located in the midlands of south carolina 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed our first acquisition of another financial institution when we merged with dutchfork bancshares  inc  the holding company for newberry federal savings bank 
the merger added three offices in newberry county 
we engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision making  emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium sized businesses  professional concerns and individuals 
during  we continued to implement our strategy to continue leveraging the dutchfork acquisition as well as integrate the operations of dekalb into our systems 
we experienced organic loan growth growth excluding the dekalb merger of  or million 
organic deposit growth was or million 
we added approximately million in loans and million in deposits through our acquisition of dekalb 
this continued growth in our loan portfolio is consistent with our strategy to leverage the deposit base in newberry county that we acquired in the dutchfork acquisition 
our loan to deposit ratio at december  was as compared to at december  the continued growth in core deposits as well as cash flow provided from our investment portfolio provided the needed cash flow to fund loan growth 
total assets grew to million  loans to million and deposits to million at december  our net income increased  in  or  over the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to the continued growth in the level of earning assets 
net income was million  or diluted earnings per share in  compared to million  or diluted earnings per share in the following discussion describes our results of operations for as compared to and compared to and also analyzes our financial condition as of december  as compared to december  like most community banks  we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments 
a primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits  on which we pay interest 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our amount of net interest income  or the difference between the income on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits 
another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
we have included a number of tables to assist in our description of these measures 
for example  the average balances table shows the average balance during  and of each category of our assets and liabilities  as well as the yield we earned or the rate we paid with respect to each category 
a review of this table shows that our loans typically provide higher interest yields than do other types of interest earning assets  which is why we intend to channel a substantial percentage of our earning assets into our loan portfolio 
similarly  the rate volume analysis table helps demonstrate the impact of changing interest rates and changing volume of assets and liabilities during the years shown 
we also track the sensitivity of our various categories of assets and liabilities to changes in interest rates  and we have included a sensitivity analysis table to help explain this 
finally  we have included a number of tables that provide detail about our investment securities  our loans  and our deposits and other borrowings 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings 
in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses and the allocation of this allowance among our various categories of loans 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other expenses we charge to our customers 
we describe the various components of this noninterest income  as well as our noninterest expense  in the following discussion 
the discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other statistical information also included in this report 

table of contents mergers on june  we consummated our merger with dekalb bankshares  inc pursuant to the merger  we issued  shares of common stock valued at million and paid million in cash to shareholders of dekalb 
other costs related to the merger included stock options valued at  and direct acquisition costs of  the fair value of assets acquired at the date of acquisition was million  including million in goodwill and  in core deposit intangible 
the fair value of liabilities assumed amounted to million 
periods prior to june  do not include the effect of the merger with dekalb 
on october   we completed our merger with dutchfork bancshares  inc pursuant to the merger  we issued  shares of common stock valued at million and paid million to shareholders of dutchfork 
other costs related to the merger included stock options valued at million and direct acquisition costs of million 
the fair value of assets acquired at the date of acquisition was million  including million in goodwill and million in core deposit intangible 
the fair value of liabilities assumed amounted to million 
the results of operations for the years ended december  and include a full year of the results of the merger with dutchfork as compared to three months for the year ended december  due to the relative asset size of dutchfork as compared to first community corporation  the comparison of the results of operations between the various periods is significantly affected by the merger 
results of operations our net income was million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   as compared to net income of million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december   and million  or diluted earnings per share  for the year ended december  the increase in net income for as compared to resulted primarily from an increase in the level of average earning assets of million 
the effect of the increase in earning assets was offset by a basis point decrease in the net interest margin from during to during on a tax equivalent basis  the net interest margin was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest spread  the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities  was in as compared to in and in see below under net interest income and market risk and interest rate sensitivity for a further discussion about the effect of this decrease in the net interest spread and in our net interest margin 
net interest income increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the provision for loan losses was  in as compared to  in non interest income increased to million in from million in due primarily to increased deposit service charges resulting from higher average deposit account balances as well as the introduction of an overdraft protection program in the fourth quarter of non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is attributable to increases in all expense categories required to support the continued growth of the bank 
the increase in net income from to resulted primarily from an increase in the level of average earning assets of million  which was partially offset by a decrease in the net interest margin from in compared to in earning assets averaged million in as compared to million in non interest income increased from million in to million in due to increased deposit service charges and increases in atm debit card fees and atm surcharge fees 
in addition  in we had gains on the sale of securities of  and gains on the early extinguishment of debt of  this compares to gains on sale of securities of  in non interest expense increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is attributable to increases in all expense categories required to support the continued growth of the bank 
in addition  expenses related to the operations of the branches acquired in the dutchfork acquisition on october  are included in the results for the entire year whereas in they were only included for the three months subsequent to the consummation of the merger 

table of contents net interest income net interest income is our primary source of revenue 
net interest income is the difference between income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets 
net interest income is determined by the rates earned on our interest earning assets and the rates paid on our interest bearing liabilities  the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income totaled million in  million in and million in the yield on earning assets  which was in  increased to and in and  respectively 
the rate paid on interest bearing liabilities was in  in and in the net interest margin was in  in and in the continued decrease in net interest margin in as compared to was a result of a smaller rise in average yields on interest earning assets relative to the rise in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
our loan to deposit ratio on average during was  as compared to in and during loans typically provide a higher yield than other types of earning assets and thus one of our goals continues to be to grow the loan portfolio as a percentage of earning assets which should improve the overall yield on earning assets and the net interest margin 
at december   the loan to deposit ratio had increased to 
the inverted yield curve throughout much of as well as a very competitive deposit and lending environment were significant contributors to the decline in the net interest margin 
the yield on earning assets increased by basis points in as compared to  whereas the cost of interest bearing funds increased by basis points during the same period 
the higher increase in the cost of funds as compared to yield on interest earning assets was primarily due to a significant increase in our funding cost on time deposits 
approximately  of our time deposits reprice within months and as a result of increases in short term interest rates during the cost of these deposits increased basis points in the average cost of time deposits was in as compared to and in and  respectively 
the average borrowed funds to total interest bearing liabilities in was  as compared to and in and  respectively 
during  we borrowed million in long term debt to facilitate the merger with dutchfork and acquired million in federal home loan bank advances as a result of the merger 
longer term borrowed funds typically have a higher interest rate than our mix of deposit products 
our average cost of borrowed funds for was as compared to and in and  respectively 
average balances  income expenses and rates 
the following tables depict  for the periods indicated  certain information related to our average balance sheet and our average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities 
such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities 
average balances have been derived from daily averages

table of contents the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and the amount attributable to changes in rate

the risk of loss can be measured in either diminished current market values or reduced current and potential net income 
our primary market risk is interest rate risk 
we have established an asset liability management committee alco to monitor and manage interest rate risk 
the alco monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income 
the alco has established policies guidelines and strategies with respect to interest rate risk exposure and liquidity 
a monitoring technique employed by us is the measurement of our interest sensitivity gap  which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time 
also  asset liability modeling is performed to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities  selling securities available for sale  replacing an asset or liability at maturity or by adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability 
managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates 
neither the gap analysis or asset liability modeling are precise indicators of our interest sensitivity position due to the many factors that affect net interest income including  the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

securities based on amortized cost 
at december   we had entered into interest rate cap and floor agreements with a notional amount of  each 
the cap rate of interest is three month libor and the floor rate of interest is three month libor 
the fair value of the agreements at december  were  these agreements were entered into to protect assets and liabilities from the negative effects of volatility in interest rates 
the agreements provide for a payment to the bank of the difference between the cap floor rate of interest and the market rate of interest 
the bank s exposure to credit risk is limited to the ability of the counterparty to make potential future payments required pursuant to the agreement 
the bank s exposure to market risk of loss is limited to the market value of the cap and floor 
the market rate of the cap was  and the floor market value was  at december  any gain or loss on the value of this contract is recognized in earnings on a current basis 
the bank received payments under the terms of the cap contract in the amount  during the year ended december  no payments were received under the terms of the cap contract in and no payments have been received under the terms of the floor contract in the bank recognized  and  in other income to reflect the increase in the value of the contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cap agreement and floor agreement expire on august  and august   respectively 

table of contents through simulation modeling  we monitor the effect that an immediate and sustained change in interest rates of basis points and basis points up and down will have on net interest income over the next months 
based on the many factors and assumptions used in simulating the effect of changes in interest rates  the following table estimates the hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december  and over the subsequent months 
even though we are liability sensitive the model at december  reflects a decrease in net interest income in a declining rate environment 
this primarily results from the current level of interest rates being paid on our interest bearing transaction accounts as well as money market accounts 
the interest rates on these accounts are at a level where they can not be repriced in proportion to the change in interest rates 
the increase and decrease of and basis points assume a simultaneous and parallel change in interest rates along the entire yield curve 
net interest income sensitivity change in short term interest hypothetical percentage change in net interest income december  rates bp bp flat bp bp we also perform a valuation analysis projecting future cash flows from assets and liabilities to determine the present value of equity pve over a range of changes in market interest rates 
the sensitivity of pve to changes in interest rates is a measure of the sensitivity of earnings over a longer time horizon 
at december  and the pve  exposure in a plus basis point increase in market interest rates was estimated to be and  respectively 
provision and allowance for loan losses at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  as compared to million  or of total loans  at december  our provision for loan loss was  for the year ended december  as compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the provision is made based on our assessment of general loan loss risk and asset quality 
the allowance for loan losses represents an amount which we believe will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
our judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on a number of assumptions about future events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove to be accurate 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on evaluations of the collectibility of loans  including consideration of factors such as the balance of impaired loans  the quality  mix  and size of our overall loan portfolio  economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  the amount and quality of collateral securing the loans  our historical loan loss experience  and a review of specific problem loans 
we also consider subjective issues such as changes in the lending policies and procedures  changes in the local national economy  changes in volume or type of credits  changes in volume severity of problem loans  quality of loan review and board of director oversight and concentrations of credit 
while net charge offs declined during the charge offs for installment and other credit card loans increased from  in to  in this primarily results from the introduction of the overdraft protection program in the fourth quarter of overdrafts are included in loans on the balance sheet and charge off of the overdraft amount  excluding fees  is charged to the allowance for loan losses 
in evaluating this overdraft protection program it was anticipated that these consumer charge offs would increase 
periodically  we adjust the amount of the allowance based on changing circumstances 
we charge recognized losses to the allowance and add subsequent recoveries back to the allowance for loan losses 
we perform an analysis quarterly to assess the risk within the loan portfolio 
the portfolio is segregated into similar risk components for which historical loss ratios are calculated and adjusted for identified changes in current portfolio characteristics 
historical loss ratios are calculated by product type and by regulatory credit risk classification 
the allowance consist of an allocated and unallocated allowance 
the allocated portion is determined by types and ratings of 
table of contents loans within the portfolio 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is established for losses that exist in the remainder of the portfolio and compensates for uncertainty in estimating the loan losses 
there can be no assurance that charge offs of loans in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses as estimated at any point in time or that provisions for loan losses will not be significant to a particular accounting period 
the allowance is also subject to examination and testing for adequacy by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions 
such regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
at december    and  we had non accrual loans in the amount of   and  respectively 
there were million   and  in loans delinquent greater than days at december   and  respectively 
there were   and  in loans greater than days delinquent and still accruing interest at december   and  respectively 
as a result of the merger with dekalb  we acquired an allowance for loan losses in the amount of  this allowance for loan losses had been recorded through the provision for loan losses for dekalb prior to the merger  which was consummated on june  our management continuously monitors non performing  classified and past due loans to identify deterioration regarding the condition of these loans

table of contents the following table presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses at the end of each of the past four years 
the allocation is calculated on an approximate basis and is not necessarily indicative of future losses or allocations 
the entire amount is available to absorb losses occurring in any category of loans 
prior to december   we did not allocate the allowance to loan losses to categories of loans but rather evaluated the allowance on an overall portfolio basis 
the change as of december  to allocating the allowance to loan losses to loan categories had no financial statement effect on the allowance for loan losses 
allocation of the allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category amount of loans in category commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial residential consumer unallocated n a n a n a n a total accrual of interest is discontinued on loans when we believe  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts that a borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed in nonaccrual status when it becomes days or more past due 
at the time a loan is placed in nonaccrual status  all interest  which has been accrued on the loan but remains unpaid is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 

table of contents noninterest income and expense noninterest income 
our primary source of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts 
in addition  we originate mortgage loans that are pre sold and funded by the third party acquirer  for which receive a fee 
other sources of noninterest income are derived from commissions on sale of non deposit investment products  bankcard fees  atm debit card fees  commissions on check sales  safe deposit box rent  wire transfer and official check fees 
noninterest income for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
this increase is due primarily to increased deposit service charges resulting from higher average deposit account balances 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of we introduced a formalized overdraft privilege program  which contributed to the increase in deposit service charges in as compared deposit service charges amounted to million in as compared to million in mortgage origination fees increased to  in as compared to  in this increase resulted from continued historically low mortgage interest rates as well as the addition of one full time and one part time originator in the last half of and another full time originator was added as a result of the dekalb acquisition in june in the first quarter of we sold securities that resulted in a loss of  the proceeds from the sale of the securities were used to pay down million in fhlb advances resulting in a gain on the early extinguishment of debt of  this compares to gains on the sale of securities in the amount of  that were recognized in the first quarter of as we continued to restructure the investment portfolio acquired from dutchfork 
a gain on the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of  was realized in the fourth quarter of this also resulted from the pay down of approximately million of the fhlb advances 
commissions on the sale of non deposit investment products increased to  in as compared to  in this increase results from emphasis on this source of income through branch referrals as well as additional calling efforts 
other noninterest income increased to million in as compared to  in this is a result of all categories of other noninterest income increasing  including loan late charges increasing by  atm debit card fees and surcharges by  and income from increases in value of bank owned life insurance of approximately  the increases in loan late charges and atm debit card fees and surcharges are a result of the continued growth of the bank 
in july we purchased an additional million in bank owned life insurance which resulted in the increase in this source of income in as compared to in addition  we realized an increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance of approximately  in as compared to  in these policies were acquired in the dutchfork acquisition and were owned for the entire year of as compared to only three months in noninterest income amounted to million in as compared to million in  an increase of million 
non interest income in included the impact of the dutchfork acquisition for a full year  whereas it only impacted during the fourth quarter of that year 
deposit service charges amounted to million in as compared to  in during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a formalized overdraft privilege program 
the introduction of the overdraft privilege program as well as increased deposit balances contributed to the increase in deposit service charges 
mortgage origination fees increased to  in as compared to  in this increase resulted from an emphasis in this area and the addition of one full time and one part time originator in the last half of we had gains on the sale of securities in the amount of  in as compared to  in gains in the amount of  were recognized in the first quarter of as we continued to restructure the investment portfolio acquired from dutchfork 
a gain on the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of  was realized in the fourth quarter of this resulted from the pay down of approximately million of the fhlb advances that were acquired in the dutchfork merger 
other noninterest income increased to  million in as compared to  in this is a result of all categories of other noninterest income increasing  including loan late charges  atm debit card fees and surcharges due to the effect of the dutchfork merger 
in addition  we realized an increase in the cash value of bank owned life insurance of approximately  in as compared to  in these policies were acquired in the dutchfork acquisition and were owned for the entire year of as compared to only three months in noninterest expense 
in the very competitive financial services industry  we recognize the need to place a great deal of emphasis on expense management and continually evaluate and monitor growth in discretionary expense categories in order to control future increases 
we have expanded our branch network over the last five years and acquired our twelfth office located in camden  south carolina in june through the acquisition of dekalb 
in july  construction was completed and we occupied our new  square foot administrative center 
we believe that the administrative center along with other initiatives continue to improve the support infrastructure to enable our company to effectively manage the asset growth and expanded branch network experienced over the last five years 
as a result of management s expansion strategy  all categories of non interest expense have continued to increase over the last several years 
we anticipate that we will continue to seek de novo branch expansion as well as possible acquisition opportunities in key markets within the midlands of south carolina 

table of contents noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased  million in as compared to we added approximately employees in connection with the merger with dekalb 
these employees were included in operations for approximately seven months during the number of full time equivalent employees at december  was as compared to at the same time in the new employees were hired to support the continued growth of the bank 
occupancy expense increased  from  in to  in the increase is primarily a result of the increased expense associated with the administrative center and the camden branch for approximately five months and seven months  respectively 
data processing cost are primarily associated with third party processors supporting our network of atm machines as well as processing atm and debit card activity 
the expense related to these activities increased  as a result of the increased activity and numbers of outstanding cards 
telephone expense increased  as result of enhancements to our data network and the addition of the camden branch 
professional fees increased from  in to  in this increase results primarily from the expense associated with the implementation of the overdraft privilege program 
expenses in related to implementing this program were approximately  ongoing professional expenses related to this program after are not anticipated to be significant 
professional fees in also include approximately  for consulting services relative to the investment portfolio 
in  the expense related to investment portfolio consulting was approximately  in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  and the rules and regulations promulgated by the securities and exchange commission that are now applicable to us  have increased the scope  complexity  and cost of corporate governance  reporting  and disclosure and as a result have increased legal and other professional fees 
the securities and exchange commission has granted an extension to non accelerated filers to comply with the management reporting provisions of section to december  the requirement for an independent attestation report on internal controls has been extended to december  for non accelerated filers 
there will be continued cost incurred relative to complying with the requirements of section into and beyond 
we continue to evaluate the best options for utilizing consulting outside resources for implementation and compliance with the requirements of section amortization of intangibles increased approximately  which is a result of amortization of the core deposit premium associated with the dekalb merger 
the core deposit premium acquired in this merger amounted to  and is being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
as a result of the merger with dutchfork in october  expenses associated with operating the three new offices were included in the results of operations for the last quarter of as compared to the full year in noninterest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salary and employee benefits increased million in as compared to we added approximately employees in connection with the merger with dutchfork 
the number of full time equivalent employees at december  was as compared to at the same time in the new employees were hired to support the continued growth of the bank 
occupancy expense increased  from  in to  in equipment expense increased by  or  in as compared to this is primarily a result of the expenses associated with the dutchfork acquisition being included for an entire year in in addition  increased depreciation and maintenance contract expense related to equipment purchased to upgrade and improve existing technology  including an upgrade to our main processor and item processing equipment needed to support increased volumes subsequent to the merger with dutchfork 
these additions and upgrades were made in the second and third quarter of and therefore did not impact the full year of noninterest expense in and included amortization of the deposit premium intangible of  and  respectively  related to the merger with dutchfork in october and the acquisition of the chapin office in february the deposit premiums of million relative to the chapin branch acquisition and the million related to the dutchfork merger are being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of seven years 
professional fees increased by  in as compared to due to increased legal fees  audit fees and consulting fees  most of which is attributable to the significant growth we experienced between the two periods

we recognize deferred tax assets for future deductible amounts resulting from differences in the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is then established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the level that it is more likely than not that the tax benefit will be realized 
there are no valuation allowances established for deferred taxes as of december  and the increase in the effective tax rate in over the prior year is primarily a result of the decrease in the amount of dividends received eligible for a dividend received deduction in versus on preferred stock held in the available for sale portfolio  in and  in 
these investments were owned by dutchfork at the date of the merger 
subsequent to the merger and as a result of restructuring certain holdings within the portfolio  a significant portion of the preferred stock holdings were sold in the fourth quarter of and first quarter of as of december   we hold preferred stock with a fair value of million in the available for sale portfolio and bank owned life insurance with a book value of million 
these holdings will continue to reduce the company s effective tax rate in future periods 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in as compared to was also a primarily a result of these assets being held only during the fourth quarter of financial position total assets at december  were million as compared to million at december  average earning assets increased to million during from million during asset growth included organic growth in loans of million during loans at december  were as compared to million at december  the increase includes million in loans acquired in the merger with dekalb

securities sold under agreements to repurchase increased by million at december  as compared to december  federal home loan bank advances decreased by million as of december  compared to december  shareholders equity totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase was a result of retained earnings of million  proceeds from issuance of stock under stock option plans and the dividend reinvestment plan of million and stock issued in the dekalb merger valued at million 
there was also a partial recovery of the net of tax unrealized loss on available for sale securities of million during 
table of contents earning assets loans 
loans typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets  and thus one of our goals is to have loans be the largest category of our earning assets 
during  loans accounted for of average earning assets as compared to of average earning assets in the increase in the ratio during demonstrates progress towards our asset mix goals 
the growth of the loan portfolio both in total dollars and as a percentage of total earning assets will continue to be a major focus throughout and thereafter 
associated with the higher loan yields are the inherent credit and liquidity risks  which we attempt to control and counterbalance 
we are committed to achieving our asset mix goals without sacrificing asset quality 
loans averaged million during  as compared to million in the following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category december  in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction mortgage residential mortgage commercial consumer total gross loans allowance for loan losses total net loans in the context of this discussion  a real estate mortgage loan is defined as any loan  other than loans for construction purposes  secured by real estate  regardless of the purpose of the loan 
we follow the common practice of financial institutions in the company s market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible  in addition to any other available collateral 
this collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan components 
generally we limit the loan to value ratio to 
the principal components of our loan portfolio  at year end and  were commercial mortgage loans in the amount of million and million  representing and of the portfolio  respectively 
significant portions of these commercial mortgage loans are made to finance owner occupied real estate 
we continue to maintain a conservative philosophy regarding our underwriting guidelines  and believe it will reduce the risk elements of the loan portfolio through strategies that diversify the lending mix

at december  we had mortgage backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations with a fair value of million 
of these million were issued by government sponsored enterprises and million are by other issuers 
we believe that none of the cmos held at december  are deemed to be invested in high risk tranches 
prior to acquiring a cmo  we perform a detailed analysis of the changes in value and the impact on cash flows in a changing interest rate environment to ensure that it meets our investment objectives as outlined in our investment policies 
at december   we also had investments in variable rate preferred stock issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc with a fair value of million  which were acquired in the dutchfork transaction 
in addition  we acquired other fixed and variable rate preferred stocks issued by fhlmc and fnma in the dutchfork transaction 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately million primarily fixed rate  preferred stock securities 
as a result of marking the securities to market at the date of acquisition  substantially no gain or loss on those transactions was recognized in in the first quarter of  we sold preferred stock securities with an approximate carrying value of million 
a gain of approximately  was realized in the first quarter of on these sales 
during we sold approximately preferred stock with a carrying value of approximately million for a net gain of approximately  at december   the remaining preferred stock securities owned have an average book value of of their par value 
the remaining fhlmc preferred stock securities have adjustable rates 
there have been no significant downgrades in the credit rating of the issuer 
given the adjustable rate nature of these securities  the dividend rate will adjust to a level more in line with current or future interest rates at a preset time in the future 
our objective in the management of the investment portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality  liquid investments 
this policy is particularly important as we continue to emphasize increasing the percentage of the loan portfolio to total earning assets 
at december   the estimated weighted average life of the portfolio was years  duration of approximately and a weighted average tax equivalent yield of approximately 
based on our evaluation of securities that currently have unrealized losses  and our ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  we do not consider any of it investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december

core deposits were million and million at december  and  respectively 
a stable base of deposits is expected to continue be the primary source of funding to meet both our short term and long term liquidity needs in the future 
the maturity distribution of time deposits is shown in the following table 
maturities of certificates of deposit and other time deposit of  or more in thousands december  within three months after three through six months after six through twelve months after twelve months total certificates of deposit of  or more there were no other time deposits of  or more at december  large certificate of deposit customers tend to be extremely sensitive to interest rate levels  making these deposits less reliable sources of funding for liquidity planning purposes than core deposits 
some financial institutions partially fund their balance sheets using large certificates of deposits obtained through brokers 
these brokered deposits can be unreliable as long term funding sources 
accordingly  we do not currently accept brokered deposits 
borrowed funds 
borrowed funds consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal home loan bank advances and long term debt as a result of issuing million in trust preferred securities 
short term borrowings in the form of securities sold under agreements to repurchase averaged million  and million during  and  respectively

in addition to the above borrowings  we issued million in trust preferred securities on september  the securities accrue and pay distributions quarterly at a rate of libor plus basis points 
the debt may be redeemed in full anytime after september  with notice and matures on september  capital total shareholders equity as of december  was million as compared to million as of december  this increase was attributable to retained net income for the year ended december  of million  a recovery in the net unrealized loss of million net of tax effect in the market value of investment securities available for sale  the issuance of shares in the dividend reinvestment plan and upon the exercise of stock options valued at million  and the issuance of  shares of common stock valued at million in conjunction with the acquisition of dekalb 
offsetting these increases was the repurchase of  shares at a total price of million pursuant to a stock repurchase program we instituted during the third quarter of authorizing the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
during the first quarter of we paid a quarterly dividend of per share 
for the last three quarters of our dividend was per share 
in and  we paid quarterly cash dividends of

under the capital guidelines of the federal reserve and the occ  the company and the bank are currently required to maintain a minimum risk based total capital ratio of  with at least being tier capital 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity  qualifying perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill 
in addition  the bank must maintain a minimum tier leverage ratio tier capital to total assets of at least  but this minimum ratio is increased by to basis points for other than the highest rated institutions 
the trust preferred securities in the amount of million that were issued on september  qualify as tier capital under the regulatory guidelines and are included in the amounts reflected below 

table of contents the company and the bank exceeded their regulatory capital ratios at december  and  as set forth in the following table

liquidity represents our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities 
liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control 
for example  the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made 
however  net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to nearly the same degree of control 
asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable  or which can be pledged  or which will mature in the near future 
liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources  principally the ability to generate customer deposits in our market area 
in addition  liability liquidity is provided through the ability to borrow against approved lines of credit federal funds purchased from correspondent banks and to borrow on a secured basis through securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
the bank is a member of the fhlb atlanta and has the ability to obtain advances for various periods of time 
these advances are secured by securities pledged by the bank or assignment of loans within the bank s portfolio 
with the successful completion of the common stock offering in  the secondary offering completed in  the trust preferred offering completed in september  the acquisition of dutchfork in october and the acquisition of dekalb in june  the company has maintained a high level of liquidity and adequate capital  along with continued retained earnings  sufficient to fund the operations of the bank for at least the next months 
the company s management anticipates that the bank will remain a well capitalized institution for at least the next months 
shareholders equity was of total assets at december  and at december  funds sold and short term interest bearing deposits are our primary source of liquidity and averaged million and million during the year ended december  and  respectively 
the bank maintains federal funds purchased lines  in the amount of million with several financial institutions  although these were not utilized in the fhlb atlanta has approved a line of credit of up to of the bank assets  which would be collateralized 
table of contents by a pledge against specific investment securities and or eligible loans 
we regularly review the liquidity position of the company and have implemented internal policies establishing guidelines for sources of asset based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non core sources 
we believe that our existing stable base of core deposits along with continued growth in this deposit base will enable us to meet our long term liquidity needs successfully 
contractual obligations the following table provides payments due by period for various contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands within one year over one to two years over two to three years over three to five years after five years total certificate accounts short term borrowings long term debt purchases total contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
please refer to note of the company s financial statements for a discussion of our off balance sheet arrangements 
impact of inflation unlike most industrial companies  the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the company and the bank are primarily monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a more significant effect on our performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices 
in addition  interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
as discussed previously  we continually seek to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations  including those resulting from inflation
