item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview forward looking statements the following discussion contains statements regarding operating trends and our beliefs and expectations regarding our future financial performance and future financial condition which are referred to as forward looking statements 
the consequences of those operating trends on our business and the realization of our expected future financial results  which are discussed in those forward looking statements  are subject to the uncertainties and risks that are described above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
due to those uncertainties and risks  the duration and effects of those operating trends on our business and our future financial performance may differ  possibly significantly  from those that are currently expected as set forth in the forward looking statements 
as a result  you should not place undue reliance on those forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update or revise any of the forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
background the following discussion presents information about our consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is pacific mercantile bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
discontinued businesses in june  we decided to exit the wholesale mortgage lending business in order to concentrate our capital and management resources on expanding our commercial banking business 
this decision was based on a number of factors  which included the steady growth achieved in  and the opportunities to further expand  our commercial lending business  increases in the costs of operations of the wholesale mortgage banking business and  therefore  the prospect that  by exiting that business  we could improve the efficiency of our operations  an anticipated increase in the variability of the period to period operating results of the wholesale mortgage lending business  which would make it more difficult to achieve consistency and predictability in our results of operations  and the amount of capital that would be required to grow and improve the profitability of the wholesale mortgage lending business  particularly in the face of the changing interest rate and market environment 
the exit of the wholesale mortgage loan operations was completed in the in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter  we sold pmb securities corp  our securities brokerage business  to gary cohee  president of pmb securities corp 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the operating results of the wholesale mortgage lending business and pmb securities corp have been classified as discontinued operations and prior period financial statements have been restated on that same basis 
see selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
additionally  as a result of exit from our wholesale mortgage lending business and pmb securities corp  our commercial banking business constitutes our continuing operations and the discussion that follows focuses almost entirely on its operations 

table of contents overview of fiscal operating results the following table sets forth information regarding the interest income that we generated  the interest expense that we incurred  our net interest income  noninterest income  noninterest expense  and our net income and net income per share for the years ended december   and year ended december  amount percent change amount percent change amount dollars in thousands except per share data interest income interest expense net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income net income per share diluted income from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income per share diluted weighted average number of diluted shares net of taxes the  or increase in income from continuing operations in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to a combination of factors  the most important of which were increase in interest income and improvement in net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  or  in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or almost  increase in interest income that was attributable primarily to i a million  or  increase in the average volume of our outstanding loans during fiscal as compared to fiscal  and ii higher yields realized on our interest earning assets due primarily to increases in interest rates by the federal reserve board in furtherance of its monetary policy that is aimed at keeping inflation in check 
the increase in interest income more than offset a million  or almost  increase in interest expense that was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of time deposits  on which we pay higher rates of interest than on other types of deposits  and the increase in interest rates resulting from the federal reserve board s monetary policy 
increase in noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased by million or  in fiscal  as compared to fiscal that increase was primarily attributable to an increase in compensation expense due to i the addition of commercial loan officers in our financial centers  beginning in the second half of  and ii the recognition of stock based compensation expense of  in fiscal  which was not required to be recognized in increases in other expenses  such as marketing and promotional expenses  regulatory fees  insurance premiums and correspondent bank fees  also contributed to the increase in noninterest expense in fiscal the increase in net income in was primarily attributable to the combination of the  increase in income from continuing operations  discussed above  and a  decrease in the loss from discontinued operations  as compared to  as discontinued operations in included the operating results of both our discontinued wholesale mortgage business which we exited during  and our securities brokerage business  whereas  discontinued operations in included only the operating results of the securities brokerage business during the period from january  up to june   which is the date that business was sold

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap and general practices in the banking industry 
certain of those accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies  because they require us to make estimates and assumptions regarding circumstances or trends that could affect the value of those assets  such as economic conditions or trends in those conditions that could impact our ability to fully collect our loans or ultimately realize the carrying value of certain of our other assets 
those estimates and assumptions are made based on current information available to us regarding those economic conditions or trends or other circumstances 
if changes were to occur in the events  trends or other circumstances on which our estimates or assumptions were based  or other unanticipated events were to happen that might affect our operations  we may be required under gaap to adjust our earlier estimates that are affected by those changes or events and to reduce the carrying value of the affected assets on our balance sheet 
our critical accounting policies relate to the determination of our allowance for loan losses  the fair value of securities available for sale and the valuation of deferred tax assets 
allowance for loan losses 
the accounting policies and practices we follow in determining the sufficiency of the allowance we establish for possible loan losses require us to make judgments and assumptions about economic and market conditions and trends that can affect the ability of our borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations to us 
accordingly  we use historical loss factors  adjusted for current economic market conditions and other economic indicators  to determine the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and the sufficiency of our allowance for loan losses 
if unanticipated changes were to occur in those conditions or trends  actual loan losses could be greater than those predicted by those loss factors and our prior assessments of economic conditions and trends 
in such an event  it could be necessary for us to increase the allowance for loan losses by means of a charge to income referred to in our financial statements as the provision for loan losses 
such an increase would reduce the carrying value of the loans on our balance sheet  and the additional provision for loan losses taken to increase that allowance would reduce our income in the period when it is determined that an increase in the allowance for loan losses is necessary 
see the discussion in the subsections entitled provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below 
fair value of securities available for sale 
we determine the fair value of our securities by obtaining quotes from third party vendors and securities brokers 
when quotes are not available  a reasonable fair value is determined by using a variety of industry standard pricing methodologies including  but not limited to  discounted cash flow analysis  matrix pricing  option adjusted spread models  as well as fundamental analysis 
these pricing methodologies require us to make various assumptions relating to such matters as future prepayment speeds  yield  duration  monetary policy and demand and supply for the individual securities 
consequently  if changes were to occur in the market or other conditions on which those assumptions were based  it could become necessary for us to make adjustments to the fair values of our securities  which would have the effect of changes in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
utilization of deferred income tax benefits 
the provision that we make for income taxes is based on  among other things  our ability to use certain income tax benefits available under state and federal income tax laws to reduce our income tax liability 
as of december   the total of the unused income tax benefits included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet  available to reduce our income taxes in future periods was million 
unless used  such tax benefits expire over time 
therefore  the realization of those benefits is dependent on our generating taxable income in the future in amounts sufficient to enable us to use those tax benefits prior to their expiration 
we have made a judgment  based on historical experience and current and anticipated market and economic conditions and trends  that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to fully utilize those benefits 
in the event that our income were to decline in future periods making it less likely that those benefits could be fully utilized  it could become necessary for us to establish a valuation reserve to cover the potential loss of those tax benefits by increasing the provision we make for income taxes  which would have the effect of reducing our net income in the period when that valuation reserve is established 

table of contents results of operations net interest income one of the principal determinants of a bank s income is net interest income  which is the difference between i the interest that a bank earns on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and ii its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities  on the other hand 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including national and local economic conditions and the monetary policies of the federal reserve board the frb which affect interest rates  the demand for loans  and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of total average interest earning assets  is a banking organization s net interest margin 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was primarily attributable to i an increase of million  or  in the average volume of our outstanding loans during fiscal over fiscal and ii an increase in yields on interest earning assets to in from in  due primarily to the effects of interest rate increases by the frb during the period from mid to the end of  in furtherance of its national monetary policies 
we funded the increase in loan volume by increasing our interest bearing deposit volume and borrowings  which included advances from the federal home loan bank 
as a result of the increase in loan volume  average outstanding loans represented of average earning assets in as compared to in the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily i increases of million in the average volume of our time deposits and million in the average of our outstanding federal home loan bank borrowings  and ii an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities to in from in  primarily as a result of the increases by the frb in interest rates pursuant to its monetary policies 
our net interest margin for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal that decrease was primarily attributable to i a change in the mix of our deposits in to a higher proportion of time deposits and a lower proportion of non interest bearing deposits which caused our interest expense to increase at a faster rate than did our interest income  and ii a continuation of the flat interest rate yield curve 
fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  net interest income increased by million  or  to million  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a million  or  increase in interest income that more than offset a million  or increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income in was primarily attributable to i an increase of million  or  in the average volume of our outstanding loans during fiscal over fiscal and ii an increase in yields on interest earning assets to in from in  due primarily to the effects of the interest rate increases that were implemented by the federal reserve board during the period from mid to the end of we funded the increase in loan volume by increasing our deposit volume and borrowings  which included advances from the federal home loan bank and investment repurchase agreements 
as a result of the increase in loan volume  average outstanding loans represented of average earning assets in as compared to in the increase in interest expense in over was due primarily i a million increase in the average volume of our borrowings  which consisted primarily of borrowings from the federal home loan bank and million principal amount of year junior subordinated debentures that we sold during the fourth quarter of  and ii an increase in the average interest rate paid on interest bearing liabilities to in from in our net interest margin for fiscal improved to from in fiscal that improvement was primarily attributable to the increase in interest income  which was only partially offset by the increase in interest expense

the following table sets forth changes in interest income  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december   and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in volumes of or changes in rates earned on interest earning assets and changes in the volumes of and rates of interest paid on our interest bearing liabilities

the table above indicates that the increase of million in our net interest income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of an increase of million in volume variance  which more than offset a decrease of  in rate variance 
the increase of million in our net interest income in the fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the result of increases of million and million  respectively  in volume and rate variance 
provision for loan losses like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining an allowance for possible loan losses that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to what management believes is its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off  or write down is charged against that allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is increased periodically i to replenish the allowance after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs  ii to reflect changes in the volume of outstanding loans  and iii to take account of changes in the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans or changes in economic conditions 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans below in this section of this report 
increases in the allowance are made through a charge  recorded as an expense in the statement of income referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance and  therefore  have the effect of increasing the allowance and reducing the amount of the provision that might otherwise have had to be made to replenish or increase the allowance 
we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines  industry standards and historical loss experience to determine both the sufficiency of the allowance for loan losses and  the amount of the provisions that are required to be made for potential loan losses 
however  those determinations involve judgments about trends in current economic conditions and other events that can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations to us 
the duration and effects of current economic trends are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and changes that are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion above in item a of this report under the caption risk factors we could incur losses on the loans we make 
if changes in economic or market conditions or unexpected subsequent events were to occur  it could become necessary to incur additional charges to increase the allowance for loan losses  which would have the effect of reducing our income or causing us to incur losses 

table of contents in addition  the frb and the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require us to make additional provisions for possible loan losses  over and above the provisions that we have already made  the effect of which would be to reduce our income 
the following table sets forth the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  and year ended december  dollars in thousands total gross loans outstanding at end of period average total loans outstanding for the period allowance for loan losses at beginning of period loans charged off recoveries provision for loan losses charges to operating expense allowance for loan losses at end of period allowance for loan losses as a percentage of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans at end of period net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total loans outstanding at end of period net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses net loans charged off to provision for loan losses includes net deferred loan costs and excludes loans held for sale 
the provisions against income made for possible loan losses were approximately million in both and although outstanding loans increased by million at december   as compared to december   the ratios of the allowance for loan losses to outstanding were and  at december  and december   respectively  largely because we began with an allowance for loan losses of million compared to million at the beginning of nonaccrual and impaired loans totaled million  or  of the allowance for loan losses at december   which included million of loans secured by first and second liens on single family residences 
in  nonaccrual and impaired loans totaled million  or  of the allowance as of that date 
additional information regarding non performing loans is contained below in the subsection entitled financial condition allowance for loan losses and nonperforming loans

in  
table of contents noninterest income declined by  or  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to the fact that we realized an  gain on sale of securities available for sale and a  net gain on sale of other real estate owned in  which did not recur in noninterest expense the following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest expense and the amounts thereof from continuing operations  incurred in the years ended december   and  respectively

as indicated above  total noninterest expense for the year ended december  increased by million  or  as compared to the increase in was primarily due to a million increase in salaries and employee benefits as a result of i the addition of lending officers at our financial centers  ii the fact that our inland empire financial center  which opened for business in july  was in operation for a full year in  and iii the recognition of stock based compensation expense of  in  in accordance with sfas r  which is an expense that was not required to be recognized in or in any other periods prior to fiscal the increase in noninterest expense in  over was primarily attributable to an increase in expenses associated with the opening  in september  of our seventh financial center  which is located in long beach  california  the opening of our inland empire financial center in july  and an increase in commercial lending activities at all of our financial centers a measure of our ability to control noninterest expense in relation to the level of our net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income is our efficiency ratio  which is the ratio of noninterest expense to net revenue 
as a general rule  all other things being equal  a lower efficiency ratio indicates an ability to generate increased revenue without a commensurate increase in the staffing and equipment and third party services and  therefore  would be indicative of greater efficiencies in our operations 
however  a bank s efficiency ratio can be adversely affected by factors such as the opening of new banking offices  the revenues of which usually lag behind the expenses that a bank must incur to staff and open the new offices 
as a result of the increases in non interest expense  in  our efficiency ratio in was  as compared to in and in financial condition assets our total consolidated assets increased by million  or  to billion at december  from million at december   primarily as a result of an increase in the volume of our outstanding loans during we believe the increase in loan volume in was primarily attributable to i the expansion and maturing of our banking 
table of contents franchise during the past two years  ii marketing programs implemented in  and iii improvements in economic conditions  that led to increases in loan demand 
this increase in outstanding loans was funded primarily by increases in deposits and  to a lesser extent  increases in the volume of federal home loan bank borrowings by us

securities available for sale 
securities that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time  but which may be sold in response to changes in liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks or other similar factors are classified as securities available for sale 
such securities are recorded on our balance sheet at their respective fair values and increases or decreases in those values are recorded as unrealized gains or losses  respectively  and are reported as other comprehensive income loss rather than included in or deducted from our earnings

the allowance for loan losses at december  was million  which represented approximately of the loans outstanding at december   as compared to million  or  of the loans outstanding at december  we carefully monitor changing economic conditions  the loan portfolio by category  the financial condition of borrowers  the history of the loan portfolio  and we follow bank regulatory guidelines in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
we believe that the allowance at december  was adequate to provide for losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  as the volume of loans increases  additional provisions for loan losses will be required to maintain the allowance at adequate levels 
additionally  the allowance was established on the basis of assumptions and judgments regarding such matters as economic conditions and trends and the condition of borrowers  historical industry loan loss data and regulatory guidelines and  if there were changes in those conditions or trends  actual loan losses in the future could vary from the losses that were predicted on the basis of those earlier assumptions  judgments and guidelines 
for example  if economic conditions were to deteriorate  or interest rates were to increase significantly  which would have the effect of increasing the risk that borrowers would encounter difficulties meeting their loan payment obligations  it could become necessary to increase the allowance by means of additional provisions for loan losses 
see results of operations provision for loan losses above 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories at the dates indicated below 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the 
table of contents allowance will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories as the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio

substantially all of the loans in the loan portfolio are graded in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio 
non performing loans 
we also measure and establish reserves for loan impairments on a loan by loan basis using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at a loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
we exclude  from our impairment calculations  smaller  homogeneous loans such as consumer installment loans and lines of credit 
also  loans that experience insignificant payment delays or shortfalls are generally not considered impaired 
we cease accruing interest and  therefore  classify as nonaccrual  any loan as to which principal or interest has been in default for a period of days or more  or if repayment in full of interest or principal is not expected 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of fully collateralized loans that were delinquent days or more and which were classified as nonaccrual and impaired loans 
we had no loans with delinquent balances of days or more and still accruing interest as of december  and there were no restructured loans at december  or december  at december   our average investment in impaired loans  on a year to date basis  was  the interest that we would have earned in the year ended december   had the impaired loans remained current in accordance with their original terms was  average balances of and average interest rates paid on deposits

we project the future sources and uses of funds and maintain sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
our primary sources of cash include i payments on loans  and ii the sale or maturity of investments  iii growth in deposits  and iv borrowings 
the primary uses of cash include funding new loans and making advances on our customers existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  including securities available for sale  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
we maintain funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
we also have obtained credit lines from the federal home loan bank and other financial institutions which can be drawn upon to meet any additional liquidity requirements 
our liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits with financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock totaled million or of total assets at december  cash flow provided by financing activities 
cash flow of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   the source of which consisted primarily of net increases of million in deposits  offset by a decrease of million in net borrowings 
cash flow from operating activities 
during the year ended december   continuing operations generated million of cash flow 
cash flow used in investing activities 
in the year ended december   we used cash flow of million in investing activities  primarily to fund an increase of million in loans and million of purchases of investment securities available for sale  partially offset by million of proceeds from maturities or principal payments received on investment securities available for sale 
cash flow from discontinued operations 
the discontinued operations of pmb securities corp  which we sold on june   provided  in cash flow during the year ended december  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of our liquidity 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are our assets 
on the other hand  since we realize greater yields and higher interest income on loans than we do on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and earnings 
as a result  our goal is 
table of contents to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans to deposits was  compared to at december  although our loans to deposits ratio was at december   we were able to maintain what we believe is adequate liquidity by means of federal home loan bank borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
in order to meet the financing needs of our customers in the normal course of business  we make commitments to extend credit and issue standby commercial letters of credit to or for our customers 
at december  and  we had outstanding commitments to fund loans totaling approximately million and million  respectively 
commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and the customer may be required to pay a fee and meet other conditions in order to draw on those commitments or standby letters of credit 
we expect  based on historical experience  that many of the commitments will expire without being drawn upon and  therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
to varying degrees  commitments to extend credit involve elements of credit and interest rate risk for us that are in excess of the amounts recognized in our balance sheets 
our maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the customers to whom such commitments are made can be as much as the amount of those commitments assuming amounts drawn by customer total of their commitments 
as a result  before making such a commitment to a customer  we evaluate the customer s creditworthiness using the same underwriting standards that we would apply if we were approving loans to the customer 
in addition  we often require the customer to secure its payment obligations for amounts drawn on such commitments with collateral such as accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  income producing commercial properties  residential properties and properties under construction 
as a consequence  our exposure to credit and interest rate risk on such commitments is not different in character or amount than risks inherent in the outstanding loans in our loan portfolio 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments to customers 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans or in the utilization of outstanding loan commitments or standby letters of credit and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future

junior subordinated debentures 
pursuant to rulings of the federal reserve board  bank holding companies are permitted to issue long term subordinated debt instruments that will  subject to certain conditions  qualify as and  therefore  augment capital for regulatory purposes 
pursuant to those rulings  in  we formed subsidiary grantor trusts to sell and issue to institutional investors a total of million principal amount of floating junior trust preferred securities trust preferred securities 
we received the net proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities in exchange for our issuance to the grantor trusts  of a total million principal amount of our junior subordinated floating rate debentures the debentures  the payment terms of which mirror those of the trust preferred securities 
the debentures also were pledged by the grantor trusts as security for their payment obligations under the trust preferred securities 
in october  we established another grantor trust that sold an additional million of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor and  in connection therewith  we sold and issued an additional million principal amount of junior subordinated floating rate debentures in exchange for the proceeds raised from the sale of those trust preferred securities 
the payments that we make of interest and principal on the debentures are used by the grantor trusts to make the payments that come due to the holders of the trust preferred securities pursuant to the terms of those securities

table of contents these debentures  which are redeemable at our option  without premium or penalty  beginning five years after their respective original issue dates  require quarterly or semi annual interest payments 
subject to certain conditions  we have the right  at our discretion  to defer those interest payments for up to five years 
however  we have no plans to exercise this deferral right 
under the federal reserve board rulings  the borrowings evidenced by the debentures  which are subordinated to all of our other borrowings that are outstanding or which we may obtain in the future  are eligible subject to certain dollar limitations to qualify  and at december   a total of million principal amount of those debentures qualified  as tier i capital for regulatory purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting our business activities 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
our interest rate risk arises from the instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  securities  deposit liabilities  and short term borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework for the company 
asset liability management the primary objective of asset liability management is to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  which can affect our net interest margins and  therefore  our net interest income and net earnings 
we seek to achieve this objective by matching interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintaining the maturities and the repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels in light of the prevailing interest rate environment 
generally  all other things being equal  i when rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  net interest income will be positively impacted during a rising interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining interest rate environment  and ii when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  net interest income generally will be positively impacted during a declining interest rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising interest rate environment 
the table below sets forth information concerning our rate sensitive assets and liabilities at december  the assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of maturity or repricing dates in accordance with their contractual terms 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table  which are discussed below 
three months or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total dollars in thousands assets interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions investment in unconsolidated trust subsidiaries securities available for sale federal reserve bank and federal home loan bank stock federal funds sold loans  gross non interest earning assets  net total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowings junior subordinated debentures other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative of rate sensitive assets in maturity period rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities n a cumulative ratio n a 
table of contents at december   as the above table indicates  our rate sensitive liabilities exceeded our rate sensitive assets and  as a result  our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative twelve month gap position 
this implies that our net interest margin would decrease in the short term if interest rates rise and would increase in the short term if interest rates were to fall 
however  the extent to which our net interest margin will be impacted by changes in prevailing interests rates will depend on a number of factors  including how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to interest rate changes  the mix of our interest earning assets loans versus other interest earning assets  such as securities and the mix of our interest bearing deposits between for example  lower cost core deposits and higher cost time certificates of deposit and our other interest bearing liabilities 
it is not uncommon for rates on certain assets or liabilities to lag behind changes in market rates of interest 
additionally  prepayments of loans and securities available for sale  and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit  could cause the interest sensitivities to vary 
additionally  the rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the table above assumes that we would make no changes in the mix of our interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities in response to changes in the interest rate environment  which is not consistent with our practices 
as a result  the relationship or gap between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities  as shown in the above table  is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity and the effect of changing rates of interest on our net interest income is likely to be different from that would be predicted on the basis of the interest rate sensitivity analysis set forth in the above table
