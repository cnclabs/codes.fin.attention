item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks described in item a  risk factors in part i and elsewhere in this annual report 
you should read the following discussion with the selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
historical per share information provided for years prior to  in item selected financial data  financial statements  footnotes and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations has been adjusted to reflect the two for one stock splits effected on june  and november  overview southwestern energy company is an independent energy company primarily focused on natural gas 
our primary business is the exploration  development and production of natural gas and crude oil within the united states  with operations principally located in arkansas  oklahoma  texas  and new mexico 
we are also focused on creating and capturing additional value at and beyond the wellhead through our established natural gas distribution and marketing businesses and our expanding gathering activities 
our marketing and our gas gathering businesses are collectively referred to as our midstream services 
we operate principally in three segments exploration and production e p  midstream services and natural gas distribution 
our business strategy is focused on providing long term growth in the net asset value of our business  which we achieve in our e p business through the drillbit 
in our e p business  we prepare economic analyses for each of our drilling and acquisition opportunities and rank them based upon the expected present value added for each dollar invested  which we refer to as pvi 
the pvi of the future expected cash flows for each project is determined using a discount rate 
we target creating at least of discounted pre tax pvi for each dollar we invest in our e p projects 
our actual pvi results are utilized to help determine the allocation of our future capital investments 
we derive the vast majority of our operating income and cash flow from the natural gas production of our e p business and expect this to continue in the future 
we expect that growth in our operating income and revenues will primarily depend on natural gas prices and our ability to increase our natural gas production 
in recent years  there has been significant price volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices due to a variety of factors we cannot control or predict 
these factors  which include weather conditions  political and economic events  and competition from other energy sources  impact supply and demand for natural gas  which determines the pricing 
in addition  the price we realize for our gas production is affected by our hedging activities as well as locational differences in market prices 
our ability to increase our natural gas production is dependent upon our ability to economically find and produce natu ral gas  our ability to control costs and our ability to market natural gas on economically attractive terms to our customers 
in  our gas and oil production increased to bcfe 
gas and oil production increased to bcfe in the increase in production primarily resulted from an increase in production from our fayetteville shale play 
we reported net income of million in  or per share on a fully diluted basis  up from the prior year 
net income in increased approximately to million  or per share  compared to the increase in net income in was a result of increased production volumes in our e p segment  a gain on the sale of our noark investment and decreased interest expense  partially offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
the increase in net income in was a result of increased production volumes and higher realized natural gas and oil prices in our e p segment 
our cash flow from operating activities increased to million in  primarily due to increased production volumes in our e p segment 
cash flow from operating activities in increased to million compared to operating income for our e p segment was million in  million in  and mil lion in operating income for our e p segment increased marginally in as increased production volumes from our fayetteville shale play and east texas were largely offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income for our e p segment increased in due to increased production volumes and higher realized prices 
operating income for our midstream services segment decreased to million in and increased to million in  compared to prior years 
operating income for our midstream services segment decreased in as increased gathering revenues were more than offset by increased operating costs and expenses and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities 
operating income for our midstream services segment increased in primarily due to favorable natural gas price opportunities along with increased volumes marketed 
operating income for our natural gas distribution segment was million in  compared to million in and million in the swn 
table of contents decrease in operating income for our natural gas distribution segment in resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses  partially offset by increased rates implemented in october the decrease in operating income for our natural gas distribution segment in resulted primarily from warmer weather and increased operating costs and expenses 
customer conservation in recent years has also impacted operating income for this segment 
on may   we sold our partnership interest in noark to atlas pipeline partners  lp  for million 
as part of the transaction  we assumed million of debt obligations of noark pipeline finance  llc  which we had previously guaranteed 
we recognized a pre tax gain of million million after tax in the second quarter relating to the transaction 
in our e p segment  we achieved a reserve replacement ratio of in at a finding and development cost of per mcfe  including reserve revisions  but excluding million of capital invested in acquiring drilling rigs 
our year end reserves grew to  bcfe  up from bcfe at the end of our results were primarily fueled by our fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
our capital investments totaled million in  an increase of compared to the prior year 
our capital investments were up to million 
we invested million in our e p segment in including million invested in drilling rigs  compared to million in and million in funds for our capital investments were provided by cash flow from operations  cash equivalents from our equity offering in  million of proceeds from the sale of our investment in noark and cash proceeds of million from a sale leaseback transaction to monetize our investment in drilling rigs 
as a result  our total debt to capitalization ratio increased slightly to at december  from at december  for  our planned capital investments are billion  an increase of over capital spending 
the capital investments for include billion for our e p segment  million for our midstream services segment and million for improvements to our utility system and other corporate purposes 
the billion of exploration and production investments includes million for the development of our fayetteville shale play 
we continue to be focused on our strategy of adding value through the drillbit  as approximately of our e p capital is allocated to drilling 
in addition to the planned investments in the fayetteville shale play  our e p investments in will be focused on our lower risk development drilling programs in east texas and other conventional drilling in the arkoma basin 
in  we are targeting production to be approximately bcfe to bcfe  compared to bcfe in  an increase of approximately to 
we expect our capital investments in to be funded by cash flow from operations  cash equivalents at december   borrowings under our recently amended revolving credit facility and or funds raised in the public debt and equity markets 
we expect growth in our reported production volumes and our oil and gas reserve quantities in given the current commodity price environment and our continued success in our fayetteville shale project 
we also believe we will have access to sufficient capital to carry out our plans while maintaining an acceptable balance between debt and equity financing

table of contents revenues  operating income and production revenues 
revenues for our e p segment increased in to million due to a increase in gas production volumes 
revenues increased in to million  primarily due to higher prices received for our natural gas and oil production and increased gas production 
we expect our production volumes to continue to increase primarily due to the development of our fayetteville shale play in arkansas 
gas and oil prices are difficult to predict and are subject to wide price fluctuations 
as of february   we have hedged bcf  bcf and bcf of our  and gas production  respectively  to help limit our exposure to price fluctuations 
revenues for  and also include pre tax gains of million  million and million  respectively  related to the sale of gas in storage inventory 
operating income 
operating income from our e p segment was million in  compared to million in  as revenues from increased production volumes were largely offset by increased operating costs and expenses 
operating income was up in compared to due to an increase in revenue primarily driven by increased production volumes and higher realized prices 
production 
gas and oil production was up approximately to bcfe in and up to bcfe in  compared to prior periods 
the increase in was the result of a bcf increase in production from our fayetteville shale play and a bcf increase in our east texas production  partially offset by declines in production from our permian and gulf coast properties 
our production in the fayetteville shale play in was negatively impacted in the last part of the year by a shortage of pressure pumping equipment and completion crews in the play area 
additional equipment and crews are now available in the play area and are currently keeping pace with our drilling activity 
the increase in production resulted from a bcfe increase in production from our overton field in east texas and a bcfe increase in production from the fayetteville shale 
production during was reduced by the effect of the curtailment of a por tion of our overton field production due to repairs of a transmission line and by the effect of hurricane katrina 
combined  these events reduced our production by an estimated bcfe 
gas sales to unaffiliated purchasers were up to bcf in and up to bcf in  compared to the prior years 
sales to unaffiliated purchasers are primarily made under contracts that reflect current short term prices and are subject to seasonal price swings 
intersegment sales to arkansas western decreased to bcf in and decreased to bcf in we expect future increases in demand for our gas production to come from sales to unaffiliated purchasers 
we are unable to predict changes in the market demand and price for natural gas  including weather related changes affecting demand of both affiliated and unaffiliated customers for our production 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our remaining south louisiana properties to a private company for million 
these properties had proved reserves of bcfe and produced approximately bcfe annually 
with this divestiture  we no longer have producing properties in the south louisiana area 
we are targeting gas and oil production of to bcfe  an increase of to over our production 
based on early production histories and modeling and assuming continued positive results  approximately to bcf of our targeted gas production is projected to come from our activities in the fayetteville shale play 
although we expect production volumes in to increase  we cannot guarantee our longer term success in discovering  developing  and producing reserves  including with respect to our fayetteville shale play 
our ability to discover  develop and produce reserves is dependent upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the availability of capital  the timing and extent of changes in natural gas and oil prices and competition 
there are also many risks inherent to the discovery  development and production of natural gas and oil 
we refer you to risk factors in item a of part i of this form k for a discussion of these risks and the impact they could have on our financial condition and results of operations 
commodity prices we periodically enter into various hedging and other financial arrangements with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and crude oil production in order to ensure certain desired levels of cash flow and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations  including fluctuations in locational market differentials we refer you to item a of this form k and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
the average price realized for our gas production  including the effects of hedges  increased slightly to per mcf in and increased to per mcf in the changes in the average price realized primarily reflect changes in average annual spot market prices and the effects of our price hedging activities 
our hedging activities increased the average gas price per mcf in  compared to reductions of per mcf in and per mcf in in recent years  locational differences in marke t prices for natural gas have been wider than historically experienced 
disregarding the impact of hedges  historically swn 
table of contents the average price received for our gas production was approximately to per mcf lower than average nymex spot market prices due to the locational market differentials 
however  during both and  widening market differentials caused the difference in our average price received for our gas production to be approximately per mcf lower than spot market prices 
assuming a nymex commodity price for of per mcf of gas  our differential for the average price received for our gas production is expected to be approximately to per mcf below the nymex henry hub index price  including the impact of our basis hedges 
as of december   we have financially protected future gas production volumes of bcf in and bcf in from the impact of widening basis differentials through our hedging activities and sales arrangements 
in addition to the basis hedges discussed above  at december   we had nymex commodity price hedges in place on bcf of and bcf of expected future gas production 
subsequent to december  and prior to february   we hedged bcf of  bcf of and bcf of gas production under fixed price swaps with a sales price ranging from to 
additionally  we hedged bcf of  bcf of and bcf of gas production under costless collars with floor prices ranging from to per mcf and ceiling prices ranging from to per mcf 
as of february   we have hedged approximately of our anticipated gas production level 
we realized an average price of per barrel  including the effects of hedges  for our oil production for the year ended december   up approximately from the prior year 
the realized average price of per barrel  including the effects of hedges  for our oil production was up from the average price we received for our oil production in  and was reduced by  and per barrel  respectively  due to the effects of our hedging activities 
assuming a nymex commodity price of per barrel of oil for  we expect the average price received for our oil production during to be approximately per barrel lower than average spot market prices  as market differentials reduce the average prices received 
operating costs and expenses lease operating expenses per mcfe for the e p segment were in  compared to in and in lease operating expenses per unit of production increased in due primarily to increases in gathering and other costs related to our operations in the fayetteville shale play 
we expect our per unit operating cost for this segment to range between and per mcfe in due to increased production volumes from the fayetteville shale play 
additionally  inflationary pressures continue to have an impact in all of our operating areas 
general and administrative expenses per mcfe for this segment were in  up from in and in the increases in general and administrative costs per mcfe in and were due primarily to increased payroll and related costs associated with the expansion of our e p operations due to the fayetteville shale play and to increased incentive compensation costs 
we added new employees during  most of which were hired in our e p segment  and we expect to hire an additional employees in approximately of the total new hires during were employed by our drilling company 
we expect our cost per unit for general and administrative expenses to decline in and to range between and per mcfe 
the expected decrease in per unit costs is due to increased production volumes from our fayetteville shale play and a reduced rate of expansion in our e p workforce 
fu ture changes in our general and administrative expenses for this segment are primarily dependent upon our salary costs  level of pension expense  stock based compensation expensing under statement on financial accounting standards no 
r share based payment fas r and the amount of incentive compensation paid to our employees 
for eligible employees  a portion of incentive compensation is based on the achievement of certain operating and performance results  including targeted cash flow  production  proved reserve additions  present value added for each dollar of capital invested  and lease operating expenses and general and administrative expenses per unit of production  while another portion is discretionary based upon an employee s performance 
additional discretionary awards may also be awarded under the incentive compensation plan 
see critical accounting policies below for further discussion of pension expense  and adoption of accounting principles below f or further discussion of stock based compensation expensing under fas r 
our full cost pool amortization rate averaged per mcfe for  per mcfe for and per mcfe for the amortization rate is impacted by reserve additions and the costs associated with those additions  revisions of previous reserve estimates due to both price and well performance  write downs that result from full cost ceiling tests and the level of unevaluated costs excluded from amortization 
we cannot predict our future full cost pool amortization rate with accuracy due to the variability of each of the factors discussed above  as well as the uncertainty of the amount of future reserves attributed to our fayetteville shale play 
unevaluated costs excluded from amortization were swn 
table of contents million at the end of  compared to million at the end of and million at the end of the increase in unevaluated costs since december  resulted primarily from an increase in our undeveloped leasehold acreage related to our fayetteville shale play and increased drilling activity 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities  are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companie s must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
however  commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials  and included approximately million related to the positive effects of future cash flow hedges of gas production 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  a nd at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end levels or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings 
inflation impacts our e p operations by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on our operations prior to were minimal due to low inflation rates 
however  since  as commodity prices have increased  the impact of inflation has intensified in our e p segment as shortages in drilling rigs  third party services and qualified labor have risen due to increased activity levels in the natural gas and oil industry 
this impact will continue to increase to the extent commodity prices remain high or further increase 
we have endeavored to mitigate rising costs by obtaining vendor pricing commitments for multiple projects and by offering performance bonuses related to increased economic efficiencies 
taxes other than income taxes per mcfe were in  in and in  and vary from year to year primarily due to changes in severance and ad valorem taxes that result from the fluctuations in commodity prices 
the timing and amount of production and reserve additions attributed to our fayetteville shale play could have a material impact on our per unit costs  if production or reserves additions are lower than projected  our per unit costs would increase 
midstream services year ended december  revenues in millions gas purchases in millions operating costs and expenses in millions operating income in millions gas volumes marketed bcf revenues from our midstream services segment were up in and up in  as compared to prior years 
the increase in revenues in resulted from increased marketing and gathering activities 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in natural gas commodity prices 
increases and decreases in marketing revenues due to changes in commodity prices are largely offset by corresponding changes in gas purchase expense 
midstream services had gathering revenues of million in  related to its gathering systems in arkansas  compared to million in gathering revenues and expenses for this segment are expected to continue to grow in the future as reserves related to our fayetteville shale play are developed and production increases 
operating income from our midstream services segment decreased in and increased in the decrease in was due to increased operating co sts and expenses that resulted from increased staffing and other costs associated with our growing gathering activities  and a decrease in the margin generated by our marketing activities caused in part by increased volatility of locational market differentials in our core operating areas 
operating income from natural gas marketing swn 
table of contents activities fluctuates depending on the margin we are able to generate between the purchase of the commodity and the ultimate disposition of the commodity 
in  we were able to generate higher margins on our marketing efforts 
we marketed bcf in  compared to bcf in and bcf in the increase in volumes marketed in and resulted from marketing our increased production volumes  largely related to our fayetteville shale play and our overton field in east texas 
additionally in  volumes marketed for third parties increased due to production growth in areas where we have historically provided marketing services to other working interest owners 
of the total volumes marketed  production from our e p subsidiaries accounted for in  in and in we enter into hedging activities from time to time with respect to our gas marketing activities to prov ide margin protection

because of the corresponding changes in purchased gas costs  the revenue effect of the pass through of gas cost changes has not materially affected operating income 
revenues for decreased to million and revenues for increased to million 
the decrease in gas distribution revenues was primarily due to lower sales volumes as a result of warmer weather

see critical accounting policies and adoption of accounting principles below for further discussion of pension expense and stock based compensation expensing  respectively 
inflation impacts our natural gas distribution segment by generally increasing our operating costs and the costs of our capital additions 
the effects of inflation on the utility s operations in recent years have been minimal due to low inflation rates 
additionally  delays inherent in the rate making process prevent us from obtaining immediate recovery of increased operating costs of our natural gas distribution segment 
regulatory matters arkansas western s rates and operations are regulated by the apsc and it operates through municipal franchises that are perpetual by virtue of state law 
these franchises  however  may not be exclusive within a geographic area 
although its rates for gas delivered to its retail customers are not regulated by the ferc  its transmission and gathering pipeline systems are subject to the ferc s regulations concerning open access transportation 
in october  in response to arkansas western s request for a million rate increase  the apsc approved a rate increase totaling million annually  exclusive of costs to be recovered through arkansas western s purchase gas adjustment clause 
the rate increase was effective for deliveries made to customers on or after october  the request relating to the october increase assumed a rate of return of and a capital structure of debt and equity

in its order approving the rate increase  the apsc stated that it would consider in future generic proceedings  certain regulatory changes including a streamlined rate case process  a revenue decoupling mechanism designed to encourage efficiency and conservation  and a performance based methodology designed to allow a var iable return on equity adjustment within a reasonable range 
on september   our natural gas distribution segment filed with the apsc an application to modify its general rates and charges 
the application seeks to increase annual operating revenues by million  a annual increase 
the apsc has months to render a decision on the application 
any increase approved is expected to take effect in july on january   the apsc initiated a notice of inquiry regarding a rulemaking for developing and implementing energy efficiency programs

net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in  compared to a increase in to million 
the primary components of cash generated from operations are net income  depreciation  depletion and amortization  the provision for deferred income taxes and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash from operating activities increased in and due mainly to increased net income  adjusted for increased depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and increased deferred income taxes generated by our e p segment 
net cash from operating activities provided of our cash requirements for capital investments in  in and in at december   our capital structure consisted of debt and equity 
we believe that our operating cash flow  cash investments at december  and borrowings under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our capital and operating requirements for  however  we may also raise funds in the public debt and equity markets to meet a portion of our cash requirements 
our cash flow from operating activities is highly dependent upon the market prices that we receive for our gas and oil production 
the price received for our production is also influenced by our commodity hedging activities  as more fully discussed in note to the financial statements included in this form k and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
natural gas and oil prices are subject to wide fluctuations 
as a result  we are unable to forecast with certainty our future level of cash flow from operations 
we adjust our discretionary uses of cash dependent upon cash flow available 
capital investments our capital investments increased to million in and to million in capital investments included million in  million in and million in related to accrued expenditures 
capital investments for in our e p segment included million related to our primary business activities and million related to the purchase of drilling rigs and related equipment which were sold in december as part of a sale and leaseback transaction 
our capital investments in also included million related to construction payments on the rigs that were sold in our e p segment expenditures included million for the acquisition of interests in natural gas and oil producing properties in and million in in thousands exploration and production exploration and development drilling rigs midstream services natural gas distribution other our capital investments for are planned to be  million  consisting of  million for exploration and production  million for midstream services  and million for gas distribution system improvements and general purposes 
we expect to allocate million of our e p capital to our fayetteville shale play 
our planned level of capital investments in will allow us to significantly accelerate our drilling activity in the fayetteville shale  continue the development of our overton field and angelina river trend properties in east texas  continue our conventional drilling in the arkoma basin  maintain our present markets  explore and develop other existing gas and oil properties  generate new drilling prospects  and provide for improvements necessary due to normal customer growth in our natural gas distribution segment 
as discussed above  our capital investment program is expected to be fund ed through cash flow from operations  cash investments at december   and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
we may also raise funds in the public debt and equity markets to fund a portion of our capital investment program 
we may adjust the level of capital investments dependent upon our level of cash flow generated from operations and our ability to borrow under our credit facility

additionally  there are certain limitations on the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by our subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our credit agreement at december  although we do not anticipate any violations of our financial covenants  our ability to comply with those covenants is dependent upon the success of our exploration and development program and upon factors beyond our control  such as the market prices for natural gas and oil

our capital structure at december  would remain at debt and equity without consideration of the accumulated other comprehensive gain and loss related to fas and fas as part of our strategy to ensure a certain level of cash flow to fund our operations  we have hedged approximately of our expected gas production 
the amount of long term debt we incur will be dependent upon commodity prices and our capital expenditure plans 
if commodity prices remain at or near their current levels throughout  our capital expenditure plans do not change and we do not issue equity  we will increase our long term debt in by approximately to million 
if commodity prices significantly decrease  we may decrease and or reallocate our planned capital investments

table of contents on april   our midstream services unit entered into a three year firm transportation agreement with ozark gas transmission system to transport volumes increasing to  mmbtu per day in the later stages of the contract 
on august   we amended the agreement to increase the maximum volumes transported from  mmbtu per day to  mmbtu per day in the later stages of the contract 
additionally  on january  our midstream services unit entered into a separate two year firm transportation agreement with ozark gas transmission system to transport volumes of  mmbtu per day 
on december   one of our midstream services subsidiaries entered into a precedent agreement pursuant to which we will contract for firm gas transportation services on two newly proposed pipeline laterals and related facilities of texas gas transmission  llc texas gas  a subsidiary of boardwalk pipeline partners  lp 
we will be a foundation shipper for the project and will use the proposed laterals and related facilities primarily to deliver gas volumes produced from southwestern s operations in its fayetteville shale play in central arkansas 
depending on regulatory approvals  the expected in service date for both laterals is january  the first lateral line fayetteville lateral will originate in conway county  arkansas  and connect to texas gas mainline system in coahoma county  mississippi 
the fayetteville lateral will be a minimum of in diameter and would have an estimated ultimate capacity of up to 
bcf per day 
the second lateral greenville lateral will originate at the texas gas mainline system near greenville  mississippi  and extend eastward to interconnect with various interstate pipelines 
the firm transportation agreements entered into by us pursuant to the precedent agreement will have an initial term of ten years and  over time  will enable us to transport up to  mmbtu per day on the fayetteville lateral and up to  mmbtu per day on the greenville lateral 
we will also have the option to acquire up to  mmbtu per day of additional capacity on the fayetteville lateral and up to  mmbtu per day of additional capacity on the greenville lateral 
upon execution and delivery of the firm transportation agreements contemplated by the precedent agreement  our midstream services segment would have additional demand charges of million that would be payable over the ten year term of the agreements 
on december   we sold of our existing drilling rigs and assigned our right to purchase two other drilling rigs to be delivered and related equipment to various financial institutions and leased the rigs from the buyers for an initial term of eight years from january  with aggregate rental payments of million annually 
we received proceeds of million 
this transaction was recorded as a sale and operating leaseback with an aggregate deferred gain of million on the sale which will be amortized against the lease payments over the lease term 
subject to certain conditions  we have options to purchase the rigs and related equipment from the lessors at the end of the th month of the lease term at an agreed upon price or at the end of the lease term for its then fair market value 
additionally  we have the option to renew the lease for a negotiated renewal term at a periodic rental equal to the fair market re ntal value of the rigs as determined at the time of renewal 
in accordance with our accounting procedures  the portion of the lease payments that represent drilling costs for our working interest in wells is capitalized to the full cost pool 
we are subject to litigation and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
management believes  individually or in aggregate  such litigation and claims will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position or our results of operations but these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management s view may change in the future 
if an unfavorable final outcome were to occur  there exists the possibility of a material impact on our financial position and the results of operations for the period in which the effect becomes reasonably estimable 
a lawsuit was filed against us in alleging a breach of an agreement to indemnify the other party against settlement payments related to our boure prospect in louisiana 
the allegations were contested and  in  we were granted a motion for summary judgment by the trial court 
the case was appealed to the first court of appeals in houston  texas  which subsequently transferred the appeal to the thirteenth court of appeals in corpus christi 
the appeal was briefed and argued during on april   the thirteenth court of appeals reversed the orders of the trial court and rendered judgment denying our motion for summary judgment and granting the motion for summary judgment of the other party 
our motion for rehearing with the thirteenth court of appeals was denied on may  in august of  we filed a petition for review with the texas supreme court 
in october of  the texas supreme cour t invited additional briefing by the parties 
in march of  the texas supreme court requested that both parties submit full briefing on the merits of the case 
after receiving full briefing from both sides  our petition for review with the texas supreme court was denied on december   and the case has been remanded to the trial court for further disposition 
should the other party prevail in the case  we could be required to pay approximately million  plus pre judgment interest and attorney s fees 
based on an assessment of this litigation by us and our legal counsel  we accrued a loss in the fourth quarter of swn 
table of contents working capital we maintain access to funds that may be needed to meet capital requirements through our credit facility described above 
we had negative working capital of million at the end of and positive working capital of million at the end of current assets at december  and included and million  respectively  of cash equivalents 
the cash equivalents resulted from the proceeds of our drilling rig sale leaseback in and from our equity offering in  respectively 
current liabilities increased million  due primarily to an increase in accounts payable related to our level of drilling activity  partially offset by a decrease in our current hedging liability at december  critical accounting policies natural gas and oil properties we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to the exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
under this method  all such costs productive and nonproductive  including salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities  are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test that limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved gas and oil reserves discounted at percent standardized measure plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
any costs in excess of the ceiling are written off as a non cash expense 
the expense may not be reversed in future periods  even though higher natural gas and oil prices may subsequently increase the ceiling 
full cost companie s must use the prices in effect at the end of each accounting quarter  including the impact of derivatives qualifying as hedges  to calculate the ceiling value of their reserves 
however  commodity price increases subsequent to the end of a reporting period but prior to the release of periodic reports may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value of reserves 
at december   and  our unamortized costs of natural gas and oil properties did not exceed this ceiling amount 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  adjusted for market differentials 
the ceiling value calculated at december  includes approximately million related to the positive effects of future cash flow hedges of gas production 
at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil  and at december   our standardized measure was calculated based upon quoted market prices of per mcf for henry hub gas and per barrel for west texas intermediate oil 
a decline in natural gas and oil prices from year end levels or other factors  without other mitigating circumstances  could cause a future write down of capitalized costs and a non cash charge against future earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our natural gas and oil properties increases when natural gas and oil prices are depressed or if there are substantial downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
under the sec s full cost accounting rules  our reserves are required to be priced using prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low natural gas or oil prices due to seasonality or other reasons  even if temporary  increases the probability of a ceiling test write down 
natural gas pricing has historically been unpredictable and any declines could result in a ceiling test write down in subsequent quarterly or annual reporting periods 
natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost method of accounting cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of natural gas and oil reserves requires extensive judgments of reservoir engineering data and is generally less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
our reservoir engineers prepare our reserve estimates under the supervision of our management 
reserve estimates are prepared for each of our properties annually by the reservoir engineers assigned to the asset management team in the geographic locations in which the property is located 
these estimates are reviewed by senior engineers who are not part of the asset management teams and the president of our e p subsidiaries 
final authority over the estimates of our proved reserves rests with our board of directors 
in each of the past three years  performance revisions to our proved reserve estimates rep resented no greater than of our total proved reserve estimates  which we believe is indicative of the effectiveness of our internal controls 
proved developed reserves generally have a higher degree of accuracy in this estimation process  when compared to proved undeveloped and proved non producing reserves  as production history and pressure data over time is available for the majority of our proved developed properties 
proved developed reserves account for of our total reserve base at december  assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
the uncertainties inherent in the reserve estimates are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we cannot assure you that our internal controls sufficiently address the numerous uncertainties and risks that are inherent in estimating quantities of natura l gas and oil reserves and projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures swn 
table of contents as many factors are beyond our control 
we refer you to although our estimated natural gas and oil reserve data is independently audited  our estimates may still prove to be inaccurate 
in item a  risk factors  of part i of this form k for a more detailed discussion of these uncertainties  risks and other factors 
we engage the services of netherland  sewell associates  inc  an independent petroleum engineering firm  to audit our reserves as estimated by our reservoir engineers 
netherland  sewell associates  inc reports the results of the reserves audit to our board of directors 
in conducting its audit  the engineers and geologists of netherland  sewell associates study our major properties in detail and independently develop reserve estimates 
for the year ended december   netherland  sewell associates issued its audit opinion as to the reasonableness of our reserve estimates  stating that our estimated proved oil and gas reserves are  in the aggregate  reasonable and have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted petroleum engineering and evaluation principles 
a decline in gas and oil prices used to calculate the discounted future net revenues of our reserves affects both the present value of cash flows and the quantity of reserves reported 
our reserve base is natural gas  therefore changes in oil prices used do not have as significant an impact as gas prices on cash flows and reported reserve quantities 
reported discounted cash flows and reserve quantities at december  were  million and  bcfe 
an assumed decrease of per mcf in the december  gas price used to price our reserves would have resulted in an approximate million decline in our future cash flows discounted at  adjusted for the effects of commodity hedges  and an approximate decrease of bcfe of our reported reserves 
under this assumption  our unamortized costs would have exceeded the ceiling of proved natural gas and oil reserves 
the decline in reserve quantities  assu ming this decrease in gas price  would have the impact of increasing our unit of production amortization of the full cost pool 
the unit of production rate for amortization is adjusted quarterly based on changes in reserve estimates and capitalized costs 
hedging we use natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options and interest rate swaps to reduce the volatility of earnings and cash flow due to fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and oil and in interest rates 
our policies prohibit speculation with derivatives and limit swap agreements to counterparties with appropriate credit standings to minimize the risk of uncollectability 
in recent years  we have hedged to of our annual production 
the primary market risks related to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
our derivative instruments are accounted for under fas  as amended by fas and fas  and are recorded at fair value in our financial statements 
we have established the fair value of derivative instruments using data provided by our counterparties in conjunction with assumptions evaluated internally using established index prices and other sources 
these valuations are recognized as assets or liabilities in our balance sheet and  to the extent an open position is an effective cash flow hedge on equity production or interest rates  the offset is recorded in other comprehensive income 
results of settled commodity hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and oil sales or in gas purchases 
results of settled interest rate hedges are reflected in interest expense 
any derivative not qualifying for hedge accounting treatment or any ineffective portion of a properly designated hedge is recognized immediately in ear nings 
for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of million related to basis differential swaps that did not qualify for hedge accounting which was partially offset by a million gain related to the change in estimated ineffectiveness of our commodity cash flow hedges 
we did not enter into any interest rate swaps in  and future market price volatility could create significant changes to the hedge positions recorded in our financial statements 
we refer you to quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of part ii of this form k for additional information regarding our hedging activities 
regulated utility operations our utility operations are subject to the rate regulation and accounting requirements of the apsc 
allocations of costs and revenues to accounting periods for ratemaking and regulatory purposes may differ from those generally applied by non regulated operations 
such allocations to meet regulatory accounting requirements are considered generally accepted accounting principles for regulated utilities provided that there is a demonstrated ability to recover any deferred costs in future rates 
during the ratemaking process  the regulatory commission may require a utility to defer recognition of certain costs to be recovered through rates over time as opposed to expensing such costs as incurred 
this allows the utility to stabilize rates over time rather than passing such costs on to the customer for immediate recovery 
this causes certain expenses to be deferred as a regulatory asset and amortized to expense as they are recovered through rates 
the apsc has swn 
table of contents not required any unbundling of services  although large industrials are free to contract for their own gas supply 
there are no pending regulations relating to unbundling of services  however  should such regulation be proposed and adopted  certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for deferred recognition and  accordingly  a write off of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required 
pension and other postretirement benefits we record our prepaid or accrued benefit cost  as well as our periodic benefit cost  for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans using measurement assumptions that we consider reasonable at the time of calculation see note to the financial statements for further discussion and disclosures regarding these benefit plans 
two of the assumptions that affect the amounts recorded are the discount rate  which estimates the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled  and the expected return on plan assets  which reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested 
for the december  benefit obligation and the periodic benefit cost to be recorded in  the discount rate assumed is 
for the periodic benefit cost  the expected return assumed is 
this compares to a discount rate of and an expected return of used in using the assumed rates discussed above  we recorded pension expense of million in and million in related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
with the adoption of fas in december  we recognized a liability of million at december   compared to million at december  related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
during  we also funded million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in  we expect to fund million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans and recognize pension expense of million and a postretirement benefit expense of million 
assuming a change in the rates lower discount rate and lower rate of return  we would have recorded pension expense of million in on september   fas was issued requiring  among other things  the recognition of the funded status of each defined pension benefit plan  retiree health care and other postretirement benefit plans and postemployment benefit plans on the balance sheet 
gas in underground storage we record our gas stored in inventory that is owned by the e p segment at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
gas expected to be cycled within the next months  assuming normal weather patterns  is recorded in current assets with the remaining stored gas reflected as a long term asset 
the quantity and average cost of gas in storage was bcf at per mcf at december   compared to bcf at per mcf at december  the gas in inventory for the e p segment is used primarily to supplement production in meeting the segment s contractual commitments including delivery to customers of our natural gas distribution segment  especially during periods of colder weather 
as a result  demand fees paid by the natural gas distribution segment to the e p segment  which are passed through to the utility s customers  are a part of the realized price of the gas in storage 
in determining the lower of cost or market for storage gas  we utilize the gas futures market in assessing the price we expect to be able to realize for our gas in inventory 
a significant decline in the future market price of natural gas could result in a write down of our gas in storage carrying cost

estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital investments  taxes and availability of funds 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil swn 
table of contents reserves is complex 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves will most likely vary from those estimated 
such variances may be material 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves set forth in this form k 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
at december   approximately of our estimated proved reserves were proved undeveloped and were proved developed non producing 
proved undeveloped reserves and proved developed non producing reserves  by their nature  are less certain than proved developed producing reserves 
estimates of reserves in the non producing categories are nearly always based on volumetric calculations rather than the performance data used to estimate producing reserves 
recovery of proved undeveloped reserves requires significant capital investments and successful drilling operations 
recovery of proved developed non producing reserves requires capital investments to recomplete into the zones behind pipe and is subject to the risk of a successful recompletion 
production revenues from proved undeveloped and proved developed non producing reserves will not be realized  if at all  until sometime in the future 
the reserve data assumes that we will make significant capital investments to develop our reserves 
although we have prepared estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with these reserves in accordance with industry standards  we cannot assure you that the estimated costs are accurate  that development will occur as scheduled or that the actual results will be as estimated 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows referred to in this form k is the current fair value of our estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves are generally based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
any changes in consumption by gas purchasers or in governmental regulations or taxation could also affect actual future net cash flows 
the timing of both the production and the expenses from the development and production of natural gas and oil properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves and their present value 
in addition  the discount factor  which is required by the sec to be used in calculating discounted fut ure net cash flows for reporting purposes  is not necessarily the most accurate discount factor for our company 
should one or more of the risks or uncertainties described above or elsewhere in this form k occur  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  our actual results and plans could differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements

interest rate swaps may be used to adjust interest rate exposures when appropriate 
expected maturity date fair value thereafter total in millions fixed rate average interest rate commodities risk we use over the counter natural gas and crude oil swap agreements and options to hedge sales of our production  to hedge activity in our marketing segment and to hedge the purchase of gas in our utility segment against the inherent price risks of adverse price fluctuations or locational pricing differences between a published index and the nymex futures market 
these swaps and options include transactions in which one party will pay a fixed price or variable price for a notional quantity in exchange for receiving a variable price or fixed price based on a published index referred to as price swaps  transactions in which parties agree to pay a price based on two different indices referred to as basis swaps  and the purchase and sale of index related puts and calls collars that provide a floor price below which the counterparty pays production hedge or receives gas purchase hedge funds equal to the amount by which the p rice of the commodity is below the contracted floor  and a ceiling price above which we pay to production hedge or receive from gas purchase hedge the counterparty the amount by which the price of the commodity is above the contracted ceiling 
the primary market risks relating to our derivative contracts are the volatility in market prices and basis differentials for natural gas and crude oil 
however  the market price risk is offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the related sale or purchase of the natural gas or sale of the oil that is hedged 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss as a result of non performance by our counterparties 
the counterparties are primarily major investment and commercial banks which management believes present minimal credit risks 
the credit quality of each counterparty and the level of financial exposure we have to each counterparty are periodically reviewed to ensure limited credit risk exposure
