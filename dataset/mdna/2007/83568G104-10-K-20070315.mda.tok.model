item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are the world leader in hand carried ultrasound hcu 
we specialize in the development of hcu systems for use in a variety of medical specialties in a range of clinical settings 
our proprietary technologies have enabled us to design hand carried diagnostic ultrasound systems that combine high resolution  all digital  broadband imaging with advanced features and capabilities typically found on cart based ultrasound systems 
we believe that the performance  size  durability  ease of use and cost effectiveness of our products are expanding existing ultrasound markets  and are opening new markets by bringing ultrasound out of the imaging lab to the point of care such as the patient s bedside or the physician s examining table for diagnosis and procedural guidance 
the large size  weight and complexity of traditional cart based ultrasound systems typically require a physician or highly trained clinician to perform the examination in a centralized imaging department  such as a hospital s radiology department 
our strategic intent is to enable clinicians to use ultrasound in a variety of clinical settings by developing each potential market based on three fundamental tenets i the design of high performance system hardware  software and transducers with application specific settings and capabilities  ii the provision of educational training that ensures appropriate use of the equipment in the clinical setting  and iii the support of professional institutions and ultrasound thought leaders in the completion of use protocols and clinical research that accelerates the adoption of hcu to improve patient outcomes 
by providing ultrasound at the primary point of care  our systems can eliminate delays associated with the outpatient referral process or moving heavy  cart based systems across hospital departments to scan patients 
this increased accessibility is changing clinical practice  improving patient care and safety and has the potential to reduce healthcare costs through earlier and more rapid diagnosis of diseases and conditions 
we design our products for applications where ultrasound has not typically been used such as emergency medicine  surgery  critical care  internal medicine and vascular access procedures as well as for imaging in traditional applications  such as radiology  cardiology  vascular medicine and obstetrics and gynecology ob gyn 
in addition  the us military has successfully deployed our systems in traditional hospital settings  field hospitals and forward surgical teams in iraq and other areas of conflict 
we began shipping our first products in september and today have an installed base of thousands of systems worldwide 
we introduced our newest product  the micromaxx system micromaxx system in april this system is our third generation product and is based on our proprietary application specific integrated circuit asic technology for high resolution ultrasound imaging and offers image resolution comparable to costly  conventional cart based ultrasound systems weighing over pounds 
our first shipments of the micromaxx system began in june and it accounted for the majority of our revenue in the system addresses both traditional and emerging ultrasound markets and includes a standard five year warranty on the system and most of the transducers  a first in the ultrasound industry 
our first generation of products includes the and ilook series 
the sonosite plus system was designed for general ultrasound imaging and the sonoheart elite is specifically configured for cardiovascular applications 
the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide visual guidance for physicians and nurses while performing vascular access procedures and the ilook imaging tool is designed to provide imaging of the chest and abdomen 
our second generation product  the titan system  began shipping in june this high performance system addresses both traditional and emerging ultrasound markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  warranty obligations  service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include accounts receivable  revenue recognition  valuation of inventories  goodwill  intangible assets  warranty expense  income taxes and stock based compensation 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the aging of our accounts receivable and evaluating individual customer receivables  considering customers financial condition  historical experience  credit history and current economic condition 
losses can be difficult to anticipate 
an increase in losses beyond those expected by management would reduce earnings when they become probable or as the estimated loss increases 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue on products and accessories when goods are shipped under an agreement with a customer  risk of loss and title have passed to the customer  sales returns are estimable and collection of any resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are provided or over the term of the contract 
revenue is recorded net of estimated returns 
sales discounts are recorded as a reduction in revenue 
sales to distributors are generally made pursuant to standard distributor agreements 
we recognize revenue when title and risk of loss have transferred to the distributor 
our only significant post shipment obligation to distributors is our product warranty covering materials and workmanship see warranty expense below 
the distributor can only reject products for an obvious defect or shipping error  generally within days of receipt  and in such cases  replacement products would be sent 
since the distributor s remedy is the replacement of the product and not a refund or credit  we do not defer revenue associated with these sales 
costs associated with the repair of returned  defective products are captured in our warranty accrual 
our standard distributor arrangements with distributors do not have any other return provisions 
our sales arrangements may contain multiple elements  which include hardware and software products 
revenue from the sale of software  software related elements  and hardware when the software elements are more than incidental to the product as a whole  is recognized in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our products 
accordingly  for transactions that have undelivered elements for which we have vsoe of the elements  revenue equal to the total fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and is not recognized until the element is delivered to the customer 
valuation of inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out method 
included in our inventories balance are demonstration products used by our sales representatives and marketing department 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  shrinkage  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
we make judgments regarding the carrying value of our inventories based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions  consumer demand and reimbursement criteria in the medical community 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying cost of our inventories 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of sonometric health  inc sonometric in we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  for each reporting unit identified for purposes of accounting for goodwill 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
there is no discrete financial information available for sonometric because it was incorporated into sonosite immediately after acquisition 
therefore  sonosite is the reporting unit to which goodwill resulting from the sonometric acquisition is assigned 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could potentially result in recognition of an impairment of goodwill  which would be reflected as a loss on our consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction in the carrying value of goodwill 
intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised primarily of acquired technology and non compete agreements related to the acquisition of sonometric and reacquired distribution rights related to the acquisition of sonosite china medical limited 
we use our judgment to estimate the fair value of each of these intangible assets 
our judgment about fair value is based on our expectation of future cash flows and an appropriate discount rate 
we also use our judgment to estimate the useful lives of each intangible asset 
with respect to definite lived intangible assets  we evaluate the remaining useful lives annually 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
if we conclude that any indefinite lived intangible asset is impaired  we would record this as a loss on our consolidated statement of operations and as a reduction to the intangible asset 
warranty expense 
we accrue estimated warranty expense at the time of sale for costs expected to be incurred under our product warranties 
this provision for warranty expense is made based upon our historical product failure rates and service repair costs using management s judgment 
we have limited history with some of our products 
in addition  we provide  with certain exceptions  a five year warranty with the micromaxx system  which we began shipping in june given the length of the warranty period  the warranty liability for the micromaxx system is more difficult to estimate than it has been for our other products that have a one year warranty 
however  given the similarity of the components used in the micromaxx system compared with our other systems and the historical product failure rate and service repair costs of those other systems  we believe that we can reasonably estimate the amount of the warranty liability for this product 
we expect our warranty liability and expense to continue to increase significantly due to the five year warranty offered with this product 
should actual failure rates and repair or replacement costs for any of our products differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required and our results may be materially affected 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to determine our income taxes 
this process involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences  and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we do not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  foreign nol carryforwards and research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets were recognized on our balance sheet in the fourth quarter of resulting in an income tax benefit 
prior to this time  we provided a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax assets primarily represent the income tax benefit of us nols we have incurred 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet representing nols from our international operations 
as required by sfas  we did not recognize any tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets related to either our us or international operations would be realized 
we re evaluate our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas  record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards actually used in future periods 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance through  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and those international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions and requires entities to recognize compensation expense for awards of equity instruments to employees based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash inflows in our consolidated statement of cash flows  in accordance with the provision of the emerging issues task force issue no  classification in the statement of cash flows of the income tax benefit received by a company upon exercise of a nonqualified employee stock option 
sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a cash provided by financing activities  rather than as an operating cash flow on a prospective basis  and therefore reduces cash provided by operating activities and increases cash provided by financing activities 
this amount is shown as excess tax benefit from exercise of stock options on our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we have adopted the long haul method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits  under which we calculate on a grant by grant basis the windfall or excess tax benefit that arose upon exercise of each award based on a comparison to the total tax deduction to the as if deferred tax asset that would have been recorded had we followed the recognition provisions of sfas since its effective date 
we use a tax law ordering methodology for determining when tax benefits from stock option exercises are realized 
total cash flows remain unchanged from what has been previously reported 
prior to adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock option grants under the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  compensation cost related to stock option grants to employees had been recognized only to the extent that the fair market value of the stock exceeded the exercise price of the stock option at the date of the grant 
we recognized compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock unit rsu grants ratably over the applicable vesting period 
the fair value was based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant 
we recorded share based compensation related to stock options in accordance with the accelerated methodology described in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
results of operations revenue revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to a full year of sales of the micromaxx system  which has a higher average selling price  expanded international operations  and increased direct sales to hospitals 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to the introduction of the micromaxx system in june and project orders from governmental entities 
united states us revenue increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily attributable to increased direct sales to hospitals  offset by a decrease in us government sales due to a large order in the first quarter of and the integration of our sales channel partner addressing the physician office market 
the increase in compared to was due to changes in our product mix as well as increased direct  us government and distributor sales and increased average selling price due to micromaxx introduction 
international revenue from europe  africa and the middle east increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased sales in our direct subsidiaries in europe  offset by decreased sales to our distributor in italy 
changes in exchange rates had minimal impact on revenue in the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales to our distributors in europe and india  and an increase in revenue from direct sales in france and spain that was partially offset by decreases in direct sales to germany 
changes in exchange rates had minimal impact on revenue in revenue from canada  latin and south america and asia pacific excluding japan increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was due to increased direct sales in canada and australia and increased sales to our distributors in latin and south america 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in sales to our distributors in latin and south america  large government sales in south america and an increase in direct sales in australia and canada 
revenue from japan increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to distribution sales through our new distributor  fukuda denshi 
the increase in was primarily due to sales under a new exclusive titan distribution arrangement and initial sales under our exclusive ilook system distribution arrangement with our distributor  nippon sherwood medical industries 
we anticipate that revenue will increase in compared to due to the continued expansion of our selling efforts worldwide 
we expect strong growth from the us physicians office market as we continue to develop this channel  strong growth from the newly expanded international operations such as china  india  australia and canada  introduction of new products and features  and the overall expansion of market awareness and acceptance of our products 
the expansion of new sales operations may not be as successful as anticipated and we may encounter regulatory and other issues in selling our products 
our revenue may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the usd 
increased competition may also impact our anticipated growth in revenue 
we currently face competition from larger companies that manufacture cart based and portable ultrasound systems and have greater financial and other resources 
gross margin gross margin increased to in compared to in and in the increase in compared to was a result of increased sales of micromaxx systems which generate a higher margin than our earlier generation products 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an improved product mix  improved manufacturing efficiencies and a reduction in the royalty owed to atl  which became effective in september we expect our gross margin percentage in to remain consistent with nevertheless  increased competition from existing and new competitors in the portable ultrasound system market could result in lower average realized prices and could lower our gross margin 
our gross margin can be expected to fluctuate in future periods based on the mix of business between direct  government and distributor sales  mix of us and international sales  and our product and accessories sales mixes 
changes in our cost of inventory also may impact our gross margin 
adjustments to reduce carrying costs are recorded for obsolete material  earlier generation products and used or refurbished products held either as saleable inventory or as demonstration product 
if market conditions change or the introduction of new products by us impacts the market for our previously released products  we may be required to further write down the carrying value of our inventory  resulting in a negative impact on gross margins 
we rely on our sales forecasts by product to determine production volume 
to the extent our sales forecasts or product mix estimates are inaccurate  we may produce excess inventory or experience inventory shortages  which may result in an increase in our costs of revenue  a decrease in our gross margin or lost sales 
our gross margin may also be impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates in the countries in which we sell our products in currencies other than the usd 
operating expenses research and development expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expenses and increased headcount to support further development of our asic technology and the micromaxx system 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to expenses associated with the development and enhancements to the micromaxx system  which began shipping in june we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in compared to due to continued development of new products  as well as further development related to the micromaxx system 
however  should our competitors develop products with features that equal or exceed the features that exist in our products  we may incur higher than anticipated research and development costs in order to accelerate existing programs and compete more effectively 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to increased stock based compensation  expansion of our sales channel partner into the physician s office market and international sales operations  increased education and training efforts and commissions related to the increase in revenue 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to increased compensation for commissions related to the increase in revenue  marketing costs incurred to promote the micromaxx system  and expansion of our international operations 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will increase in compared to primarily due to marketing expenses for education and training  increased compensation for commissions related to the anticipated increase in revenues  expansion of operations in china  india  canada and australia and continued growth in our european subsidiaries 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was attributable to increased stock based compensation and increased headcount to support business growth  offset by a reduction in legal expenses 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to defending our patent rights in the existing neutrino patent infringement litigation  defending ourselves in a dispute with a former distributor and supporting our business growth 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will slightly increase in compared to in addition  we may incur legal expenses regarding our ongoing litigation or unanticipated legal expenses if we become involved in any new litigation 
other income loss total other income was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income  which was attributable to our increasing cash reserves 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to an increase in interest income  which was caused by an increase in the return on our investments due to higher average interest rates during the year 
income tax expense income tax expense was million in  compared to income tax expense of million in and an income tax benefit of million in due to our profitable operations in and  we recorded income tax expense for financial reporting purposes and accordingly reflected changes in our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily representing net operating losses from our international operations  resulting in a reduction of million to our income tax provision 
as required by sfas  we did not reverse the valuation allowance until it was more likely than not that the tax asset would be realized 
the income tax expense is based on a blended federal and state rate applied to us income and the applicable foreign rates applied to foreign income 
while this tax expense reduced net income  no cash will be paid for income taxes  other than required alternative minimum tax and foreign and state tax payments  until the nol and tax credits have been fully utilized 
foreign nols will be utilized in jurisdictions where they are available and cash will be paid in jurisdictions that do not have foreign nols 
in  we reversed the valuation allowance on us deferred tax assets resulting in a net income tax benefit of million 
the deferred tax assets primarily represent the income tax benefit of us nols and tax credits we have incurred 
as required by sfas  we did not reverse the valuation allowance until it was more likely than not that the tax assets would be realized 
we reevaluate our ability to realize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and  in compliance with sfas  record any resulting adjustments that may be required to deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol carryforwards actually used in future quarters as well as the reversing affect of temporary differences 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents balance was million as of december   compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market accounts 
our short term and long term investment securities totaled million as of december   compared to million as of december  investment securities consist of high grade us government or corporate debt and high grade asset backed securities 
we have the ability to hold our securities until maturity  however  we classify all securities as available for sale  as the sale of such securities may be required prior to maturity to implement management strategies 
operating activities provided cash of million in  compared to cash used of million in and cash provided of million in the cash provided in compared to the cash used in was primarily due to increased net income  before non cash stock based compensation in our consolidated statements of operations and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses  reduced by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the cash used in compared to was primarily due to an increase in receivables resulting from increased sales and a decrease in accounts payable that were partially offset by an increase in accrued expenses and our non cash deferred tax benefit 
we anticipate that cash provided by operations will increase slightly in compared to primarily due to anticipated continued profitable operations 
our ability to provide cash from operations will depend on our ability to successfully sell our products  collect our receivables  control our inventories and manage our expenses 
investing activities used cash of million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in cash used in compared to was due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
the decrease in cash used in compared to was primarily due to million of net sales maturities of investments in compared to million of net purchases of investment securities in additionally  cash used in investing activities decreased as a result of a reduction in purchases of property and equipment and a reduction in acquisition activities 
we anticipate using cash to invest in high quality investment instruments in  the extent of which will depend on the interest rate environment during the period and the timing of cash flows from our operations during the period 
financing activities provided cash of million in compared to million in and million in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan totaling million in compared to million in and million in additional cash of million was provided by the excess tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in  which are required to be classified as cash provided by financing activities since our adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of we believe that our existing cash and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations and planned capital expenditures in nevertheless  we may experience an increased need for additional cash due to any significant decline in our revenue or gross margin  any delay or inability to collect accounts receivable  any acquisition or strategic investment in another business  any significant increase in expenditures as a result of expansion of our sales and marketing infrastructure  our manufacturing capability or our product development activities  and any significant increase in our sales and marketing expenditures as a result of our introduction of new products 
off balance sheet arrangements during the year ended and as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements  other than obligations under our operating leases reflected in the contractual obligations table below 
furthermore  except for certain foreign exchange rate hedging transactions that we enter into from time to time  discussed more fully under foreign currency risk in item a below  we are not a party to any derivative transaction 
we apply the disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin  to our agreements that contain guarantee or indemnification clauses 
we provide i indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers and distributors against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products  ii indemnifications of varying scope and size to our customers against third party claims arising as a result of defects in our products  iii indemnifications of varying scope and size to consultants against third party claims arising from the services they provide to us  and iv guarantees to support obligations of some of our subsidiaries such as lease payments 
these indemnifications and guarantees give rise only to the disclosure provisions of fin to date  we have not incurred material costs as a result of these obligations and do not expect to incur material costs in the future 
accordingly  we have not accrued any liabilities in our consolidated financial statements related to these indemnifications or guarantees 
contractual obligations we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases      other commitments in  we entered into an agreement to contribute up to million to a research university 
this pledge  which is to be paid over a four year period  is conditioned upon our election to make a payment on an annual basis 
we contributed million in and million in as part of our agreements with our suppliers  suppliers may procure resources and material expected to be used for the manufacture of our product in accordance with our production schedule provided to them 
we may be responsible for compensating our suppliers for these procurements in the event these items are not used in the quantities submitted as part of the production schedule or material becomes obsolete as a result of production timing  material changes or design changes 
as part of obtaining our lease for our current facility  we are required to deposit million  representing restricted cash with our bank 
also  we were required to maintain a deposit of million with our bank in the united kingdom as security for payment of customs and duties charges 
both amounts are included in other long term assets and are not included in the table above 
in the us  we have complemented our direct sales efforts by entering into group purchasing agreements with major healthcare group purchasing organizations gpo 
typically  a gpo negotiates with medical suppliers  such as us  on behalf of the gpo s member healthcare facilities  providing such members with uniform pricing and terms and conditions 
in exchange  the gpo identifies us as a preferred supplier for its members 
member facilities participating in the gpo s purchasing program can consist of hospitals  medical group practices  nursing homes  surgery centers  managed care organizations  long term care facilities  clinics and integrated delivery networks 
currently  we have gpo supply agreements with various groups including amerinet  inc  premier  inc  novation llc  medassets hsca  inc  broadlane  inc includes kaiser permanente  tenet healthcare and others and consorta  inc these agreements require us to pay fees based on the amount of sales generated from these agreements 
we recorded fees related to these agreements as sales and marketing expenses in the amounts of million in  million in and million in recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken on a tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  fin also requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes 
we do not believe that the adoption of fin will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab is effective as of the end of our fiscal year  allowing a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings as of january  for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab the adoption of sab did not impact our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently reviewing the provisions of sfas to determine the impact for the company 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  including an amendment to fasb statement no 
under sfas  entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement consistent with the board s long term objectives for financial instruments 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  the company is still in the process of evaluating the impact that adoption of sfas will have on its future consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk relating to changes in interest rates  which could adversely affect the value of our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   our investments consisted of million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of less than one year and million of interest bearing debt securities with maturities of more than one year 
we have the ability to hold these securities until maturity  however  we have classified them as available for sale in the event of unanticipated cash needs 
the interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
we believe that the impact on the fair market value of our securities and related earnings for from a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would not have a material impact on the investment portfolio 
foreign currency risk except for sales transacted by our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries  we transact all our sales in usds  therefore  the obligations of many of our international customers are in usds 
our exposure to risk from fluctuations in foreign currencies relates primarily to the strengthening of the usd against the local currency of our international subsidiaries  which may result in foreign exchange losses on transactions with them  and our international customers  which may impact our ability to collect amounts owed by them 
as of december  of our outstanding accounts receivable balance was from international customers  of which  or million  was denominated in a currency other than usds 
total sales for the year ended december  denominated in a currency other than usds were million  or of total consolidated revenues 
the british pound  the european union euro and the japanese yen represented the majority of financial transactions executed in a currency not denominated in usds 
we regularly review our receivable positions in foreign countries for any indication that collection may be at risk 
in addition  we utilize letters of credit where they are considered necessary in order to mitigate our collection risk 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations on earnings associated with foreign currency exchange rate changes 
as of december   we had million and million in notional amount of foreign currency forward contracts that expire on january  and march   respectively 
they serve as hedges of a substantial portion of our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the usd 
these foreign currencies primarily include the british pound  the euro and the japanese yen 
a sensitivity analysis of a change in the fair value of these contracts indicates that if the usd weakened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would decrease by million 
conversely  if the usd strengthened by against the applicable foreign currency  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
any gains and losses in the fair value of these contracts would be largely mitigated by offsetting losses and gains on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the sensitivity analysis above 
the fair value of these contracts as of december  was not material to our results of operations or our financial position
