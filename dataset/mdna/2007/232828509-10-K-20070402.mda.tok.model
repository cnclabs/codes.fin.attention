item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the discussion under selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview cytrx corporation cytrx is a biopharmaceutical research and development company engaged in developing human therapeutic products based primarily upon our small molecule molecular chaperone co induction technology 
we recently completed a phase iia clinical trial of our lead small molecule product candidate  arimoclomol  for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  which is commonly known as als or lou gehrig s disease 
we plan to initiate a phase iib trial of arimoclomol for this indication during the second half of  subject to clearance from the us food and drug administration 
we also are pursuing clinical development of our other small molecule product candidates  as well as a novel hiv dna protein vaccine 
we previously entered into strategic alliances with respect to the development of products using our other technologies 
we also are engaged in developing therapeutic products based upon ribonucleic acid interference  or rnai  which has the potential to effectively treat a broad array of diseases by interfering with the expression of targeted disease associated genes 
in order to fully realize the potential value of our rnai technologies  in january we transferred to rxi pharmaceuticals corporation  our majority owned subsidiary  substantially all of our rnai related technologies and assets 
rxi will focus solely on developing and commercializing therapeutic products based upon rnai technologies for the treatment of human diseases  including neurodegenerative diseases  cancer  type diabetes and obesity 
we have relied primarily upon selling equity securities and upon proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants and  to a much lesser extent  upon payments from our strategic partners and licensees  to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  and as of march   we had received approximately million in connection with the exercise of warrants and options since december  we believe that we have adequate financial resources to support our currently planned level of operations into the first quarter of  which expectation is based in part on projected expenditures for of million for our phase iib trial for arimoclomol for als and related studies  million for our other ongoing and planned preclinical programs  million for general and administrative expenses  and million to provide interim funding for rxi s first few months of operations 
we estimate rxi will expend approximately million on development activities for including approximately  in payments under agreements with umms  million in other research and development expenses and million in general and administrative expenses 
if  in addition to the interim funding for which we have already budgeted  we elect to provide rxi with all or a substantial portion of its initial funding for and beyond in the coming few months  and if we are unable to raise funds in the future to replenish any amounts that we provide to rxi  our current working capital will be depleted accordingly 
we have no significant revenue  and we expect to have no significant revenue and to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years 
our net losses may increase from current levels primarily due to expenses related to our ongoing and planned clinical trials  research and development programs  possible technology acquisitions  and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate  therefore  that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 

table of contents rxi pharmaceuticals corporation in addition to transferring to rxi our rnai related technologies and assets  we have recently entered into a number of agreements relating to rxi as described in part i  item  of this annual report under the caption rxi pharmaceuticals corporation recent developments  which will affect our future financial condition and results of operations 
on january   we entered into a letter agreement with rxi under which rxi has agreed to reimburse us  following its initial funding  for all organizational and operational expenses incurred by us in connection with the formation  initial operations and funding of rxi 
as of february   we had advanced approximately  to rxi for which it will be obligated to reimburse us 
we have agreed to reduce our share of ownership of rxi to less than a majority of the outstanding voting power as soon as reasonably practicable following rxi s initial funding in the coming few months 
in order to reduce our ownership interest in rxi  we may seek to dispose of a portion of our rxi shares through a dividend or distribution of such shares to our stockholders  a sale or other disposition to one or more third parties  or other means 
we have no agreement  understanding or arrangement with respect to the possible disposition of any of our rxi shares 
any proposed dividend or other distribution to our stockholders of rxi shares would be subject to sec rules and the requirements of the delaware general corporation law 
we may be unable to comply with these rules and requirements  or may experience delays in complying 
any such dividend or distribution may be taxable to cytrx 
there is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations to umms to reduce our ownership of rxi in a manner that would be advantageous to us or our stockholders 
rxi began operating as a stand alone company with its own management  business  and operations in january following rxi s initial funding  we have agreed under our letter agreement with umms and our separate stockholders agreement with rxi and its other current stockholders to reduce our share of ownership of rxi to less than a majority of the outstanding voting power as soon as reasonably practicable 
during the time that rxi is majority owned  the consolidated financial statements of cytrx will include of the assets and liabilities of rxi and the ownership of the interests of the minority shareholders will be recorded as minority interests 
in the future  if cytrx owns more than but less than of the outstanding shares of rxi  cytrx would account for its investment in rxi using the equity method 
under the equity method  cytrx would record its pro rata share of the gains or losses of rxi against its historical basis investment in rxi 
for  we expect rxi s research and development expenses will be approximately million  which  if rxi were to remain a consolidated subsidiary of cytrx  would result in an increase in our consolidated research and development expenses and a corresponding decrease in our consolidated cash position 
research and development expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  with research and development expenses representing approximately  and of our total expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included in research and development expenses for was million of in process research and development that was written off in conjunction with our acquisition of assets from biorex 
research and development expenses are further discussed below under critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations 
we presently expect to incur expenses of approximately million for our phase ii clinical program with arimoclomol for als during  and an additional million in and million in the actual cost of our clinical program for als could differ significantly from our current projections due to any additional requirements imposed by the fda in connection with our planned phase iib trial  or if actual costs are higher than current management estimates for other reasons 
in the event that actual costs of our clinical program for als  or any of our other ongoing research activities  are significantly higher than our current estimates  we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations 

table of contents there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development 
moreover  there are uncertainties specific to any new field of drug discovery  including our molecular chaperone co induction technology and rxi s rnai related technologies 
the successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to advance product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of our products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
table of contents revenue recognition nonrefundable license fee revenue is recognized when collectibility is reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt  when no continuing involvement on our part is required and payment of the license fee represents the culmination of the earnings process 
nonrefundable license fees received subject to future performance by us  or that are credited against future payments due to us are deferred and recognized as services are performed and collectibility is reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt  or upon termination of the agreement and all related obligations thereunder  whichever is earlier 
our revenue recognition policy may require us in the future to defer significant amounts of revenue 
in august  we received approximately million in marketable securities which were sold by us for approximately million in cash from the privately funded als charitable remainder trust alscrt in exchange for the commitment to continue research and development of arimoclomol and other potential treatments for als and a one percent royalty in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol 
under the arrangement  we retain the rights to any products or intellectual property funded by the arrangement and the proceeds of the transaction are non refundable 
further  the alscrt has no obligation to provide any further funding to us 
we have analyzed the transaction and concluded that  due to the research and development components of the transaction  it is properly accounted for under sfas no 
 research and development arrangements 
accordingly  we have recorded the value received under the arrangement as deferred service revenue and will recognize service revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition  meaning that service revenue is recognized on a dollar for dollar basis for each dollar of expense incurred for the research and development of arimoclomol and then the development of other potential als treatments 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended related to the services provided 
we adjust our estimates quarterly as better information becomes available 
as of december   we recognized approximately million of service revenue related to this transaction 
we adjust our estimates of als related research and development costs incurred on a quarterly basis 
any significant change in als related research and development expense in any particular quarterly or annual period will result in a change in the recognition of revenue for that period and consequently affect the comparability or revenue from period to period 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for direct and overhead related research expenses and are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include costs to acquire technologies which are utilized in research and development and which have no alternative future use 
until technological feasibility has been established  technology developed for use in our products also is expensed as incurred 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  include obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we recognize expenses for these activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs and other activity based factors 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
share based compensation our share based employee compensation plans are described in note of the notes to our financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas r  accounting for stock based compensation  revised r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  non employee directors  and consultants  including employee 
table of contents stock options 
sfas r differs from our previous accounting under apb and sfas for periods prior to january in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  share based payment  relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
our statement of operations as of and for the year ended december  reflects the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our results of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million 
as of december   there was  of unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding options that is expected to be recognized as a component of our operating expenses through compensation costs will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  with the following weighted average assumptions used for grants in  and  respectively risk free interest rates of  and  respectively  expected volatility of  and  respectively  expected life of the options of years  years and years  respectively  and no dividends made in any year 
based on historical experience  for  we estimated an annualized forfeiture rate of for options granted to employees and for options granted to senior management and directors 
for and  we accounted for forfeitures on an as occurred basis 
any change in actual forfeitures from our historical experience could result in an adjustment of our forfeiture estimate and a corresponding change in the amount of compensation expenses recorded in any single quarterly or annual period 
the weighted average fair value of stock options granted during  and was  and  respectively 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations for all awards granted to employees 
under apb  when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals or exceeds the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period 
we account for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods  or services  which require that such equity instruments be recorded at their fair value on the measurement date 
the measurement of share based compensation generally is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest 
non employee share based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
in certain circumstances  however  option grants to non employees are immediately vested and are therefore recorded as an expense if the service has been provided  or capitalized as a prepaid asset and amortized over the period of service if the services has not been provided as of the vesting date 
additionally  in our estimates  we consider the achievement of performance by non employee service providers at the grant date 
we have adopted the simplified method provided in sfas r to use for calculating the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool  or apic pool  related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
we have not recognized excess tax benefits related to employee stock based compensation and  therefore  do not currently have an apic pool 
in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp 
fsp specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be 
table of contents separately recognized and measured in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies 
for registration payment arrangements and financial instruments subject to those arrangements that were entered into prior to the issuance of eitf  this guidance is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we have elected to reflect early adoption of fsp in our financial statements  and the adoption did not have an effect on our financial statements 
in adopting fsp  we concluded that it was not probably that we would be required to pay any penalties under the existing registration rights agreements entered into in january and march impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  for impairment on an annual basis  as of december  or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying values 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
earnings per share basic and diluted loss per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
common share equivalents which consist of options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be antidilutive 
common share equivalents which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future  and which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share  totaled approximately million shares  million shares and million shares at december   and  respectively 
in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march  and january   we recorded deemed dividends of  and million  respectively 
these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of and the year ended  as restated  to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
quarterly financial data the following table sets forth unaudited statement of operations data for each quarter during our most recent two fiscal years 
this quarterly information has been derived from our unaudited financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered 
the quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
quarter ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data restated total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock restated total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock 
table of contents quarterly and yearly loss per share amounts are computed independently of each other 
therefore  the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not equal the per share amounts for the year 
in  we adopted sfas r  and incurred million in employee non cash compensation expense 
no corresponding expenses were recorded in or in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march  and january   we recorded deemed dividends of  and million  respectively 
these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of and the year ended  as restated  to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
our quarterly financial data has been restated to reflect the impact of the deemed dividend upon the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the three month periods ended march  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and total assets of million compared to million and million  respectively  at december  our working capital totaled million at december   compared to million at december  we have relied primarily upon selling equity securities and upon proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants and  to a much lesser extent  upon payments from our strategic partners and licensees  to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations 
as of march   we also had received approximately million in connection with the exercise of warrants and options since december  we believe that we have adequate financial resources to support our currently planned level of operations into the first quarter of  which expectation is based in part on projected expenditures for of million for our phase iib trial for arimoclomol for als and related studies  million for our other ongoing and planned preclinical programs  million for general and administrative expenses  and million to provide interim funding for rxi s first few months of operations 
we estimate rxi will expend approximately million on development activities for including approximately  in payments under agreements with umms  million in other research and development expenses and million in general and administrative expenses 
if  in addition to the interim funding for which we have already budgeted  we elect to provide rxi with all or a substantial portion of its initial funding for and beyond in the coming few months  and if we are unable to raise funds in the future to replenish any amounts that we provide to rxi  our current working capital will be depleted accordingly 
we anticipate it will take a minimum of three years and possibly longer for us to generate recurring revenue  and we will be dependent on obtaining future financing until such time  if ever  as we can generate significant recurring revenue 
we have no commitments from third parties to provide us with any additional future financing  and may not be able to obtain future financing on favorable terms  or at all 
rxi initial funding requirements umms may terminate the umms licenses and the new umms invention disclosure agreement with rxi will not become effective unless rxi achieves a funding milestone in the coming few months 
we are not obligated to provide rxi with any of the initial funding  and neither cytrx nor rxi has any commitment or agreement from any source to provide funding to rxi 
no assurance can be given that rxi will  in fact  receive initial funding 
in the event that rxi does not receive the initial funding either from cytrx or one or more third parties in the coming few months  umms will be entitled to terminate the umms licenses and the new umms invention disclosure agreement will not become effective 
the loss of 
table of contents the umms licenses and new umms invention disclosure agreement could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
in that event  rxi s ability to develop the rnai technologies that we contributed to rxi also could be materially and adversely affected 
in our letter agreement with umms and our separate stockholders agreement with rxi and its other current stockholders  we have agreed to reduce our share of ownership of rxi to less than a majority of the outstanding voting power as soon as reasonably practicable following rxi s receipt of initial funding 
in order to reduce our ownership interest in rxi  we may seek to dispose of a portion of our rxi shares through a dividend or distribution of such shares to our stockholders  a sale or other disposition to one or more third parties  or other means 
we have no agreement  understanding or arrangement with respect to the possible disposition of any of our rxi shares 
any proposed dividend or other distribution to our stockholders of rxi shares would be subject to sec rules and the requirements of the delaware general corporation law 
we may be unable to comply with these rules and requirements  or may experience delays in complying 
any such dividend or distribution may be taxable to cytrx  and would likely be taxable to our stockholders 
there is no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our obligations to umms to reduce our ownership of rxi in a manner that would be advantageous to us or our stockholders 
discussion of activities and future capital requirements net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash provided from operating activities for that period was million 
the million in cash provided from operating activities includes net proceeds of million received from the als charitable remainder trust in august in connection with the sale of a one percent royalty interest in our worldwide sales of arimoclomol for als 
included in the net loss of million is the million of revenue recognized in in connection with that sale 
the remaining million of the net proceeds from that sale were recorded as deferred revenues 
other non cash items included in our net loss necessary to reconcile cash provided from operating activities include a net change in assets and liabilities of million  million in stock option expense related to options granted to employees and consultants   related to the issuance of stock pursuant to a license agreement with umms   of depreciation and amortization expense and  of retirements 
included in the million in stock option expense related to options granted to employees and consultants is million of expenses for employee options recorded under sfas r  which we adopted in  and accordingly no corresponding amount was recorded in earlier periods 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  which resulted in net cash used in operating activities of million 
adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  were primarily  of stock option expense related to options granted to consultants  as well as a net change in assets and liabilities of  offset by the recording of  in depreciation and amortization 
our net loss for the year ended december  was million  which includes the write off of million of in process research and development related to the acquisition of assets from biorex 
the million loss resulted in net cash used in operating activities of million 
adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  were primarily  of common stock  options and warrants issued in lieu of cash for general and administrative services  as well as a net change in assets and liabilities of  and depreciation of  additionally  we issued  of common stock in lieu of cash in connection with certain license fees and million of common stock in connection with research and development activities  as well as a net change 
for the year ended december   only a small amount of cash was used in investing activities 
for the year ended december   the only significant investing activity was the redemption of an approximately million certificate of deposit 
other investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of small amounts of computers and laboratory equipment 
we expect capital spending to increase during over our levels to support our increasing research and development efforts 
in the year ended december 
table of contents   net cash used in investing activities consisted of  for the purchase of securities to be held to maturity and  for property and equipment  which includes  related to assets acquired in connection with the molecular library assets of biorex 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the year ended december  during  we raised million through the sale of common stock and an additional  as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the decrease in cash provided from financing activities of million is due to a greater amount of cash being raised from the issuance of common stock in the year ended december  during the year ended december   we raised million through the sale of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was million 
the cash provided was the result of  received upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and the million private equity financing completed in october we believe that we have adequate working capital to allow us to operate at our currently planned levels into the second quarter of we estimate rxi s expenditures for will be approximately million 
we may require additional capital in order to fund the completion of our phase ii clinical program for arimoclomol for the treatment of als  and the other ongoing research and development related to the drug candidates acquired from biorex in october we spent million on the arimoclomol clinical program in  and we estimate that the overall program  including the ongoing studies and the planned phase iib trial that we expect to initiate in the second half of  subject to clearance from the fda  will require us to expend an additional million 
we expect to incur expenses of approximately million in  and million thereafter over the following to months of the program 
however  we may incur substantial additional expense and the trial may be delayed if the fda requires us to generate additional pre clinical or clinical data in connection with the clinical trial  or the fda requires us to revise significantly our planned protocol for the phase iib 
we intend also to pursue other sources of capital  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
our ability to obtain future financings through joint ventures  product licensing arrangements  equity financings  gifts  and grants or otherwise is subject to market conditions and out ability to identify parties that are willing and able to enter into such arrangements on terms that are satisfactory to us 
depending upon the outcome of our fundraising efforts  the accompanying financial information may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results or future financial condition 
we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and there can be no assurance that we will become profitable 
even if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain that profitability 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations we acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required  contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by a regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 

table of contents these arrangements may be material individually  and in the unlikely event that milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
our current contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows non cancelable cancelable operating employment research and license leases agreements subtotal development agreements subtotal in thousands total and thereafter total operating leases are primarily facility lease related obligations  as well as equipment and software lease obligations with third party vendors 
employment agreement obligations include management contracts  as well as scientific advisory board member compensation agreements 
research and development obligations relate primarily to our phase iib clinical trial for arimoclomol for als 
most of these purchase obligations are cancelable 
license agreements generally relate to our obligations for licenses with umms associated with rnai  which we are developing through our majority owned rxi subsidiary 
included in the license obligations is an  payment that may be made in cash or common stock of rxi to umms 
we anticipate making that payment in common stock of rxi following rxi s initial funding 
license and collaboration agreements in may  we expanded our relationship with umms by entering into a new co exclusive license agreement related to a patent application for chemical modifications of rnai invented by tariq m 
rana  phd in consideration of that license  we made a cash payment of  and  in december  issued it a total of  shares of our common stock which were valued  for financial statement purposes  at approximately  on january   we entered into a contribution agreement with rxi under which we assigned and contributed to rxi substantially all of our rnai related technologies and assets  including the license described above 
the assigned assets consisted primarily of our licenses from umms and from the carnegie institution of washington relating to fundamental rnai technologies  as well as equipment situated at our worcester  massachusetts  laboratory 
the licensed technologies include patent applications on rnai target sequences  chemical modifications and delivery to cells  field specific licenses to a patent application on chemical modification of rnai  the tuschl i patent  and our exclusive licenses to patent applications that 
table of contents disclose gene targets for diabetes and obesity  including rip see  material licenses and other agreements  below 
in connection with the contribution of the licenses and other assets  rxi assumed primary responsibility for all payments to umms and other obligations under the contributed licenses and assets 
in addition to the rnai licenses and rights that we contributed to rxi  on january   rxi entered into three exclusive  worldwide  sublicenseable licenses with umms for three different patent families and one non exclusive  worldwide  non sublicensable license for a fourth patent family  which we refer to collectively as the umms licenses  pursuant to which umms granted rxi rights under certain umms patent applications to make  use and sell products related to applications of rnai technologies 
the umms licenses include an exclusive license covering nanotransporters  which may be effective in the delivery of rnai compounds  as well as methods and potential compounds for the potential treatment of als that can be delivered locally to the central nervous system 
as consideration for the umms licenses  we paid umms an aggregate up front fee of  and reimbursed umms  for previously incurred patent expenses 
rxi also agreed under the umms licenses to undertake to complete an initial funding of rxi in the coming few months 
upon the completion of rxi s initial funding  rxi will be obligated to pay umms an additional license fee of  and issue to umms an aggregate of  of rxi common stock that is to be valued on a per share basis for this purpose based on the valuation of rxi in its initial funding 
the foregoing license agreements with umms require us to make aggregate payments of up to  in in subsequent periods  we will be required to make aggregate payments ranging from  to million per year to maintain the licenses 
we are obligated to pay legal expenses for the prosecution of patents licensed from umms  which we anticipate will be approximately  during  and to make milestone payments to umms based upon our progress in the clinical development and marketing of products utilizing the technologies licensed from umms 
in the event that we were to successfully develop a product in each of the categories of obesity type diabetes and als  these milestone payments could aggregate up to million 
we also would be required to pay royalties to umms based on the net sales of those products 
the actual milestone payments will vary  perhaps significantly  based upon the milestones we achieve and the products  if any  we develop 
on january   rxi also entered into an invention disclosure agreement with umms pursuant to which umms is obligated for a three year period to disclose to rxi any unrestricted inventions conceived or reduced to practice by umms related to therapeutic applications of rnai technologies 
upon completion of rxi s initial funding  rxi will be obligated to pay umms  in cash  and additionally either pay umms another  in cash or issue to umms  of rxi common stock that is to be valued on a per share basis for this purpose based on the valuation of rxi in the initial funding

in may  we licensed from the technology transfer company of the imperial college of science  technology medicine  or imperial college  the exclusive rights to intellectual property covering a drug screening method using rip  which is a nuclear hormone co repressor that is believed to regulate fat accumulation 
in consideration of the license  we made cash payments to imperial college totaling  and issued it a total of  shares of our common stock which were valued  for financial statement purposes  at  because the technologies licensed from umms and imperial college umms had not achieved technological feasibility at the time that we licensed them  had no alternative future uses and  therefore  had no separate economic value  the total cost of all cash payments and stock issued for acquisition of the technology was expensed as research and development

the remaining million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  and the million in state net operating loss carryforwards  are unrestricted 
additionally  due to the change in control  approximately million of research and development tax credits will not be available for utilization and were written off 
as of december   we also had research and development and orphan drug credits for federal and state purposes of approximately million and  respectively  available for offset against future income taxes  which expire in through based on an assessment of all available evidence including  but not limited to  our limited operating history in our core business and lack of profitability  uncertainties of the commercial viability of our technology  the impact of government regulation and healthcare reform initiatives  and other risks normally associated with biotechnology companies  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards and credits will not be realized and  as a result  a deferred tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
results of operations cytrx corporation recorded net losses of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we recognized million in service revenues  of which million resulted from our million sale to the als charitable remainder trust of a one percent royalty interest in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol in the year ended december  additionally  during we earned an immaterial amount of license fees and grant revenue 
in the year ended december   we earned an immaterial amount of service and license fee revenue 
all future licensing fees under our current licensing agreements are dependent upon successful development milestones being achieved by the licensor 
during fiscal  we are not anticipating the receipt of any significant service or licensing fees  although we estimate that we will recognize an additional million in service revenues from that arimoclomol royalty transaction 
we will continue to recognize the balance of the deferred revenue recorded from the royalty transaction with the als charitable remainder trust based on actual research and development costs incurred over the development period of our arimoclomol research

table of contents right to acquire an option to negotiate exclusive licenses for those disclosed technologies  and v the on going small molecule drug discovery operations at our massachusetts laboratory 
although our future research and development activities could vary substantially  our research and development activities will remain substantial in the future as a result of commitments related to the foregoing activities 
research and development expenses presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements during were primarily the result of efforts to develop rnai through new and existing licensing agreements  sponsored research agreements  as well as research and development efforts performed at our massachusetts laboratory 
all research and development costs related to the activities of rxi and our laboratory were expensed 
in october  we acquired all of the clinical and pharmaceutical and related intellectual property assets of biorex  a hungry based company focused on the development of novel small molecules with broad therapeutic applications in neurology  diabetes and cardiology for approximately million in cash 
included in the assets acquired from biorex are a molecular library  as well as the molecules arimoclomol  iroxanadine and bimoclomol  each of which had  at the time of acquisition  successfully completed the european equivalent of a phase i clinical trial 
after management s evaluation of the acquired technology  approximately million of the acquisition price was expensed in as in process research and development 
as compensation to members of our scientific advisory board and consultants  and in connection with the acquisition of technology  we sometimes issue shares of our common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever is more reliably measurable 
we recorded non cash charges of   and million in this regard during   and  respectively 
with our adoption of sfas r during  we recorded  of employee stock option expense 
no corresponding expense existed in or in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase primarily as a result of our ongoing phase ii clinical program with arimoclomol and related studies for the treatment of als and our continued development of our rnai assets by our majority owned subsidiary rxi 
we currently estimate that the phase iib trial for arimoclomol for als and related studies will cost approximately million over the to months beginning december additionally  we estimate rxi will expend approximately million on development activities for general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses stock  stock option and warrant expenses to non employees and consultants employee stock option expense general and administrative expenses include all administrative salaries and general corporate expenses  including legal expenses associated with the prosecution of our intellectual property

the legal expenses increase of  was associated with maintenance of our patent portfolio and the formation of 
table of contents rxi 
during  we expect legal expenses to remain consistent with levels  as we expect patent expenses to increase  while being off set by a decline in legal expenses associated with the formation of rxi 
in our efforts to comply with sarbanes oxley for the year ended december  we incurred approximately  in consulting  audit and accounting system conversion expense 
cytrx was required to comply with the attestation requirements under section of the sarbanes oxley act for the first time for the year ended december   therefore there are no corresponding expenses in we expect to incur in a similar level of expense associated with our sarbanes oxley compliance 
our general and administrative salaries increased by  over the expense level as a result of a higher bonuses  additional regulatory and accounting personnel and annual salary increases 
during  we incurred approximately million in higher salary expense than  although the difference in total general and administrative expense was substantially smaller between and due to one time expenses associated with our change in auditors in  severance paid to certain members of management in the first half of  and the settlement of certain legal proceedings  for which there was no comparable expense in with our adoption of sfas r during  we recorded  of employee stock option expense 
no corresponding expense existed in or from time to time  we issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever we can measure more reliably 
we recorded non cash charges of million during  million during and million during these charges relate primarily to common stock  stock options and warrants issued for licensing fees and in connection with the engagement and retention of financial  business development and scientific advisors 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the depreciation expense reflects the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization expenses related to our molecular library  which was placed in service in march severance and other contractual payments to officers in accordance with mutual general release and severance agreements entered into in may  we paid our former general counsel and our former chief financial officer  approximately  and months of related benefits and approximately  and months of related benefits  respectively 
in addition  as part of the same agreements  the general counsel and chief financial officer were vested in options to purchase  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock

minority interest in losses of subsidiary we recorded  in and  in related to the minority interest in losses of our former cytrx laboratories subsidiary 
on june   we repurchased the minority interest from dr 
michael czech  and on september   we merged cytrx laboratories into cytrx 
rxi is approximately owned by cytrx  and began operating as a stand alone company with its own management  business  and operations in january following rxi s initial funding  we have agreed under our letter agreement with umms and our separate stockholders agreement with rxi and its other current stockholders to reduce our share of ownership of rxi to less than a majority of the outstanding voting power as soon as reasonably practicable 
during the time that rxi is majority owned  the consolidated financial statements of cytrx will include of the assets and liabilities of rxi and the ownership interests of the minority shareholders will be recorded as minority interests 
in the future  if cytrx owns more than but less than of the outstanding shares of rxi  cytrx would account for its investment in rxi using the equity method 
under the equity method  cytrx would record its pro rata share of the gains or losses of rxi against its historical cost basis investment in rxi 
for  we expect rxi s research and development expenses will be approximately million  which  if rxi were to remain a consolidated subsidiary of cytrx
