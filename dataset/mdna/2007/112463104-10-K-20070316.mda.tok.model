growth through expansion of ancillary services 
we plan to grow our revenues by expanding the innovative senior care program initially developed by arc throughout our independent living  assisted living  retirement centers ccrc and management services segments 
through the innovative senior care program  we currently provide therapy  home health and other ancillary services  as well as education and wellness programs  to residents of certain of our independent living  assisted living  and skilled nursing facilities 
these programs are focused on wellness and physical fitness to allow residents to maintain maximum independence 
these services provide many continuing education opportunities for residents and their families through health fairs  semina rs  and other consultative interactions 
the therapy services we provide include physical  occupational  speech and other specialized therapy and home health services 
in addition to providing these in house therapy and wellness services at our facilities  we also provide these services to other senior living facilities that we do not own or operate 
these services may be reimbursed under the medicare program or paid directly by residents from private pay sources and revenues are recognized as services are provided 
we believe there is a significant opportunity to grow our revenues by expanding these services to facilities at which they are not presently offered  which we believe will increase our revenue per unit bed in the future

growth through the acquisition and consolidation of asset portfolios and other senior living companies 
we plan to take advantage of the fragmented continuing care  independent living and assisted living sectors by selectively purchasing existing operating companies and facilities 
from january through december  not including those facilities we acquired and subsequently disposed of  we commenced leasing or acquired the ownership or management of senior living facilities with approximately  units beds 
in  we commenced leasing or acquired the ownership or management of senior living facilities with approximately  units beds 
in  we have already acquired one facility with units beds and the skilled nursing component with units beds of a facility previously acquired by us and have definitive agreements to acquire two facilities with units beds  which we expect to close in april however  there can be no assurance we will acquire these facilities 
our acquisition strategy will continue to focus primarily on facilities where we can improve service delivery  occupancy rates and cash flow 
we expect to finance our acquisitions  on a long term basis  by using primarily equity issuances combined with debt with rates fixed generally via interest rate swaps

expansion of existing facilities where economically advantageous 
certain of our facilities with stabilized occupancies and excess demand in their respective markets may benefit from additions and expansions which additions and expansions may be subject to landlord  lender and other third party consents offering increased capacity  as well as additional levels of service for residents 

table of contents competitive strengths we believe our nationwide network of senior living facilities is well positioned to benefit from the growth and increasing demand in the industry 
some of our most significant competitive strengths are

proven track record of successful acquisitions 
from january through december   we commenced leasing or acquired the ownership or management of senior living facilities not including those facilities we acquired and subsequently disposed of with approximately  units beds 
our experience in acquiring senior living facilities enables us to consider a wide range of acquisition targets in the senior living industry 
in addition  we believe our expertise in integrating these facilities into our operations enables us to acquire facilities while causing minimal disruption to either the residents or facility operating staff

high quality purpose built facilities 
as of december   we operate a nationwide base of purpose built facilities in states  including facilities in nine of the top ten standard metropolitan statistical areas 
we have experienced significant facility operating income growth and occupancy growth over the past year 
our facility operating income increased  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   and our occupancy rate increased  from as of december  to as of december

ability to provide a broad spectrum of care 
given our diverse mix of independent and assisted living facilities and ccrcs  we are able to meet a wide range of our customers needs 
we believe that we are one of the few companies in the senior living industry with this capability 
we believe that our multiple product offerings create marketing synergies and cross marketing opportunities

the size of our business allows us to realize cost and operating efficiencies 
we are the largest operator of senior living facilities in the united states based on total capacity 
the size of our business allows us to realize cost savings in the purchasing of goods and services and also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions  some of which have yet to be realized in our operating results given the recent acquisition of arc in july we intend to utilize our expertise and size to capitalize on economies of scale resulting from our national platform 
our geographic footprint and centralized infrastructure provide us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of seni or living facilities 
as a result  we are able to achieve economies of scale with respect to the goods and services we purchase 
in connection with our formation transactions and our acquisitions  we negotiated new contracts for food  insurance and other goods and services 
in addition  we have and will continue to consolidate corporate functions such as accounting  finance  human resources  legal  information technology and marketing as we make additional acquisitions 
we began to realize these savings upon the completion of our formation transactions in september and expect to realize additional savings as we continue to consolidate and integrate various corporate functions 
in addition  our size and broad geographical footprint give us an advantage in executing our acquisition strategy 
when we acquire a facility in one of our existing markets  we are able to integrate that facility with minimal incremental cost 
this allows us to acquire assets more efficiently and to better compete against other o perators for acquisitions with a more geographically limited presence

table of contents operations segments we currently have four reportable segments independent living  assisted living  retirement centers ccrcs  and management services 
these segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision makers organize our business activities for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
in connection with the integration of arc s operations into our business  which increased our resident capacity nearly  we have recently reorganized our operating divisions into the chicago operating group  the milwaukee operating group and the nashville operating group 
the chicago operating group is now primarily responsible for the operation of our independent living facilities  the milwaukee operating group is now primarily responsible for the operation of our freestanding assisted living facilities including memory care facilities and the nashville operating group is now primarily responsible for the operation of our retirement centers ccrc facilities 
in light of these organizational changes  we determined that it was necessary to revise our reportable segments to correspond to the new operating group structure 
we have retained the management services segment  as the organizational changes detailed above did not impact that segment 
our management services segment includes the results of facilities that we operate on behalf of third parties and affiliates pursuant to management agreements 
information regarding the other segments is included below under our product offerings 
operating results from our four business segments are discussed further in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note to our consolidated and combined financial statements included herein 
our product offerings we offer a variety of senior living housing and service alternatives in facilities located across the united states 
our primary product offerings consist mainly of i independent living facilities  ii assisted living facilities  and iii retirement centers ccrcs 
as discussed above under segments  we also operate certain facilities on behalf of third parties and affiliates pursuant to management agreements 
independent living 
our independent living facilities are primarily designed for middle to upper income seniors generally age and older who desire an upscale residential environment providing the highest quality of service 
the majority of our independent living facilities consist of both independent living and assisted living units in a single facility  which allows residents to age in place by providing them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services 
while the number varies depending upon the particular facility  approximately of all of the units at our independent living facilities are independent living units  with a smaller number of units licensed for assisted living 
our independent living facilities are large multi story buildings containing on average units beds 
residents may choose from studio  one bedroom and two bedroom units  depending upon the specific facility 
each independent living facility provides residents with basic services such as meal service  hour emergency response  housekeeping  concierge services  transportation and recreational activities 
most of these facilities also offer custom tailored supplemental care services at an additional charge  which may include medication reminders  check in services and escort and companion services 
in addition  our innovative senior care program is currently available in certain of our independent living facilities 
through the program  we are able to offer our residents various education  wellness  therapy  home health and other ancillary services 
in addition to the basic services  our independent living facilities that include assisted living also provide residents with supplemental care service options to provide assistance with adls 
the levels 
table of contents of care provided to residents vary from facility to facility depending  among other things  upon the licensing requirements of the state in which the facility is located 
residents in our independent living facilities are able to maintain their residency for an extended period of time due to the range of service options available to residents not including skilled nursing as their needs change 
residents with cognitive or physical frailties and higher level service needs are accommodated with supplemental services in their own units or  in certain facilities  are cared for in a more structured and supervised environment on a separate wing or floor 
these facilities also generally have a dedicated assisted living staff  including nurses at the majority of facilities  and separate assisted living dining rooms and activity areas 
our independent living facilities represent approximately of our total senior living capacity 
assisted living 
our assisted living facilities offer housing and hour assistance with adls to mid acuity frail and elderly residents 
our assisted living facilities include both freestanding  multi story facilities with more than beds and smaller  freestanding single story facilities with less than beds 
depending upon the specific location  the facility may include i private studio  one bedroom and one bedroom deluxe apartments  or ii individual rooms for one or two residents in wings or neighborhoods scaled to a single family home  which includes a living room  dining room  patio or enclosed porch  laundry room and personal care area  as well as a caregiver work station 
we also operate memory care facilities  which are freestanding assisted living facilities specially designed for residents with alzheimer s disease and other dementias requiring the attention  personal care and services needed to help cognitively impaired residents maintain a higher quality of life 
our memory care facilities have from to beds and some are part of a campus setting  which includes a freestanding assisted living facility 
all residents at our assisted living and memory care facilities receive the basic care level  which includes ongoing health assessments  three meals per day and snacks  coordination of special diets planned by a registered dietitian  assistance with coordination of physician care  social and recreational activities  housekeeping and personal laundry services 
in some locations we offer our residents exercise programs and programs designed to address issues associated with early stages of alzheimer s and other forms of dementia 
in addition  we offer at additional cost higher levels of personal care services to residents at these facilities who are very physically frail or experiencing early stages of alzheimer s diseas e or other dementia and who require more frequent or intensive physical assistance or increased personal care and supervision due to cognitive impairments 
we also offer our innovative senior care program at certain of our assisted living and memory care facilities 
as a result of their progressive decline in cognitive abilities  residents at our memory care facilities typically require higher levels of personal care and services and therefore higher monthly service fees 
specialized services include assistance with adls  behavior management and an activities program  the goal of which is to provide a normalized environment that supports residents remaining functional abilities 
whenever possible  residents participate in all facets of daily life at the residence  such as assisting with meals  laundry and housekeeping 
our assisted living facilities including our memory care facilities represent approximately of our total senior living capacity 
retirement centers ccrcs 
our retirement centers ccrcs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate all levels of physical ability and health 
most of our retirement centers ccrcs have independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing available on one campus  and some also include memory care and alzheimer s units 
some of our retirement centers ccrcs are entry fee communities  in which residents in the independent living apartment units pay a one time upfront entrance fee  typically  to  or more  which fee is partially refundable in certain circumstances 
the amount of the entrance fee varies depending upon the type and size of the dwelling unit  the type of contract plan selected  whether the contract contains a lifecare benefit ie  a healthcare discount for the resident  the 
table of contents amount and timing of refund  and other variables 
these agreements are subject to regulations in various states 
in addition to their initial entrance fee  residents under all of our entrance fee agreements also pay a monthly service fee  which entitles them to the use of certain amenities and services 
since we receive entrance fees upon initial occupancy  the monthly fees are generally less than fees at a comparable rental community 
the refundable portion of a resident s entrance fee is generally refundable upon the sale of the unit  or in certain agreements  upon the resale of a comparable unit or months after the resident vacates the unit 
in addition  certain entrance fee agreements entitle the resident to a refund of the original entrance fee paid plus a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale 
we also offer a broad array of ancillary services  including therapy  home health  and other services through our innovative senior care program  to the residents of each of our retirement centers ccrcs 
our retirement centers ccrcs represent approximately of our total senior living capacity 
operations overview we continually review opportunities to expand the types of services we provide to our residents 
to date  we have been able to increase our monthly resident fees each year and we have generally experienced increasing facility operating margins through a combination of the implementation of efficient operating procedures and the economies of scale associated with the size and number of our facilities 
our operating procedures include securing national vendor contracts to obtain the lowest possible pricing for certain services such as food  energy and insurance  implementing strict budgeting and financial controls at each facility  and establishing standardized training and operations procedures 
we believe that successful senior living operators must effectively combine the business disciplines of housing  hospitality  health care  marketing  finance and real estate expertise 
we have implemented intensive standards  policies and procedures and systems  including detailed staff manuals  which we believe have contributed to high levels of customer service and to improved facility operating margins 
we have centralized accounting controls  finance and other operating functions in our support centers so that  consistent with our operating philosophy  facility based personnel can focus on resident care and efficient operations 
we have established company wide policies and procedures relating to  among other things resident care  facility design and facility operations  billings and collections  accounts payable  finance and accounting  risk management  development of employee training materials and progra ms  marketing activities  the hiring and training of management and other facility based personnel  compliance with applicable local and state regulatory requirements  and implementation of our acquisition  development and leasing plans 
consolidated corporate operations support we have developed a centralized infrastructure and services platform  which provides us with a significant operational advantage over local and regional operators of senior living facilities 
the size of our business also allows us to achieve increased efficiencies with respect to various corporate functions such as human resources  finance  accounting  legal  information technology and marketing 
we are also able to realize cost efficiencies in the purchasing of food  supplies  insurance  benefits  and other goods and services 
in addition  we have established centralized operations groups to support all of our product lines and facilities in areas such as training  regulatory affairs  asset management  dining and procurement 
facility staffing and training each facility has an executive director responsible for the overall day to day operations of the facility  including quality of care  social services and financial performance 
each director receives specialized training from us 
in addition  a portion of each director s compensation is directly tied to 
table of contents the operating performance of the facility  key service quality measures  and to the maintenance of high occupancy levels 
we believe that the quality of our facilities  coupled with our competitive compensation philosophy  has enabled us to attract high quality  professional facility directors 
depending upon the size of the facility  each director is supported by a facility staff member who is directly responsible for day to day care of the residents and either facility staff or regional support to oversee the facility s marketing and community outreach programs 
other key positions supporting each facility may include individuals responsible for food service  activities  housekeeping  and engineering 
we believe that quality of care and operating efficiency can be maximized by direct resident and staff contact 
employees involved in resident care  including the administrative staff  are trained in the support and care needs of the residents and emergency response techniques 
we have adopted formal training and evaluation procedures to help ensure quality care for our residents 
we have extensive policy and procedure manuals and hold frequent training sessions for management and staff at each site 
quality assurance we maintain quality assurance programs at each of our facilities through our corporate and regional staff 
our quality assurance program is designed to achieve a high degree of resident and family member satisfaction with the care and services that we provide 
our quality control measures include  among other things  facility inspections conducted by corporate staff on a regular basis 
these inspections cover the appearance of the exterior and grounds  the appearance and cleanliness of the interior  the professionalism and friendliness of staff  quality of resident care including assisted living services  nursing care  therapy and home health programs  the quality of activities and the dining program  observance of residents in their daily living activities  and compliance with government regulations 
our quality control measures also include the survey of residents and family members on a regular basis to monitor their perception of the quality of services provided to residents 
in order to foster a sense of community as well as to respond to residents desires  at our larger facilities  we have established a resident council or other resident advisory committee that meets monthly with the director of the facility 
separate resident committees also exist at many of these facilities for food service  activities  marketing and hospitality 
these committees promote resident involvement and satisfaction and enable facility management to be more responsive to the residents needs and desires 
marketing and sales our marketing strategy is intended to create awareness of us  our facilities  our products and our services among potential residents and their family members and among referral sources  including hospital discharge planners  physicians  clergy  area agencies for the elderly  skilled nursing facilities  home health agencies and social workers 
our marketing staff develops overall strategies for promoting our facilities and monitors the success of our marketing efforts  including outreach programs 
in addition to direct contacts with prospective referral sources  we also rely on print advertising  yellow pages advertising  direct mail  signage and special events  health fairs and community receptions 
certain resident referral prog rams have been established and promoted within the limitations of federal and state laws at many facilities 
competition the senior living industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous other companies that provide similar senior living alternatives  such as home health care agencies  community based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other senior living providers 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living and assisted living segments of the senior living industry are not substantial  except in the skilled nursing segment 
although new construction of senior living communities has declined in recent years  we have 
table of contents experienced and expect to continue to experience competition in our efforts to acquire and operate senior living facilities 
some of our present and potential senior living competitors have  or may obtain greater financial resources than us and may have a lower cost of capital 
consequently  we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract residents or expand our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
our major competitors are sunrise senior living  inc  colson colson holiday retirement corp  professional community management life care services  llc and atria senior living group 
an affiliate of fortress  recently announced that it had acquired substantially all of the north american operations and facilities of holiday retirement corp 
customers our target independent living residents are senior citizens age and older who desire or need a more supportive living environment 
the average independent living resident resides in an independent living facility for months 
a number of our independent living residents relocate to one of our facilities in order to be in a metropolitan area that is closer to their adult children 
our target assisted living residents are predominantly female senior citizens age and older who require daily assistance with two or three adls 
the average assisted living resident resides in an assisted living facility for months 
residents typically enter an assisted living facility due to a relatively immediate need for services that might have been triggered by a medical event or need 
our target retirement centers ccrc residents are senior citizens who are seeking a facility that offers a variety of services and a continuum of care so that they can age in place 
these residents generally first enter the facility as a resident of an independent living unit and may later move into an assisted living or skilled nursing unit as their needs change 
we believe our combination of independent and assisted living operating expertise and the broad base of customers that this enables us to target creates a unique opportunity for us to invest in a broad spectrum of assets in the senior living industry  including independent living  assisted living  ccrc and skilled nursing assets 
our employees as of december  we had approximately  full time employees and approximately  part time employees  of which work in our chicago headquarters office  work in our nashville office and work in our milwaukee office 
employees are unionized 
we currently consider our relationship with our employees to be good 
government regulation the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to intensify in the number and type of laws and regulations affecting it 
in addition  federal  state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws and regulations 
this is particularly true for large for profit  multi facility providers like us 
some of the laws and regulations that impact our industry include state and local laws impacting licensure  protecting consumers against deceptive practices  and generally affecting the facilities management of property and equipment and how we otherwise conduct our operations  such as fire  health and safety laws and regulations and privacy laws  federal and stat e laws designed to protect medicare and medicaid  which mandate what are allowable costs  pricing  quality of services  quality of care  food service  resident rights including abuse and neglect and fraud  federal and state residents rights statutes and regulations  anti kickback and physicians referral stark laws  and safety and health standards set by the occupational safety and health administration 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local legislation or regulation 
changes in the regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business 
many senior living facilities are also subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
although requirements vary from state to 
table of contents state  these requirements may address  among others  the following personnel education  training and records  facility services  including administration of medication  assistance with self administration of medication and the provision of nursing  home health and therapy services  staffing levels  monitoring of resident wellness  physical plant specifications  furnishing of resident units  food and housekeeping services  emergency evacuation plans  professional licensing and certification of staff prior to beginning employment  and resident rights and responsibilities  including in some states the right to receive health care services from providers of a resident s choice that are not our employees 
in several of the states in which we operate or may operate  we are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses 
in addition  in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate  assisted living facilities  home hea lth agencies and or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the facility can be opened or the services at an existing facility can be expanded 
senior living facilities may also be subject to state and or local building  zoning  fire and food service codes and must be in compliance with these local codes before licensing or certification may be granted 
these laws and regulatory requirements could affect our ability to expand into new markets and to expand our services and facilities in existing markets 
in addition  if any of our presently licensed facilities operates outside of its licensing authority  it may be subject to penalties  including closure of the facility 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
unannounced surveys or inspections may occur annually or bi annually  or following a regulator s receipt of a complaint about the facility 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we receive deficiency reports from state regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys 
most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed to plan of corrective action relating to the facility s operations  but the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified facility  which could result in the imposition of fines  imposition of a provisional or conditional license  suspension or revocation of a license  suspension or denial of admissions  loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions  including criminal penalties 
loss  suspension or modification of a license may also cause us to default under our loan or lease agreements and or trigger cross defaults 
sanctions may be taken against providers or facilities without regard to the providers or facilities history of compliance 
we may also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action under applicable laws or regulations 
to date  none of the deficiency reports received by us has resulted in a suspension  fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues 
however  any future substantial failure to compl y with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole 
in addition  states attorney general vigorously enforce consumer protection laws as those laws relate to the senior living industry 
state medicaid fraud and abuse units may also investigate assisted living facilities even if the facility or any of its residents do not receive federal or state funds 
regulation of the senior living industry is evolving at least partly because of the growing interests of a variety of advocacy organizations and political movements attempting to standardize regulations for certain segments of the industry  particularly assisted living 
our operations could suffer if future regulatory developments  such as federal assisted living laws and regulations  as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies determined by survey or inspection officials  increase the number of citations that can result in civil or criminal penalties 
certain current state laws and regulations allow enforcement officials to make determinations on whether the care provided by one or more of our facilit ies exceeds the level of care for which the facility is licensed 
a finding that a facility is delivering care beyond its license might result in the immediate transfer and discharge of residents  which may create market instability and other adverse consequences 
furthermore  certain states may allow citations in one facility to impact other facilities in the state 
revocation or suspension of a license  or a citation  at a given facility could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other facilities  which may also cause us to be in default under our loan or lease agreements and trigger cross defaults or may also trigger defaults under 
table of contents certain of our credit agreements  or adversely affect our ability to operate and or obtain financing in the future 
if a state were to find that one facility s citation will impact another of our facilities  this will also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency 
if regulatory requirements increase  whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules  including increased enforcement brought about by advocacy groups  in addition to federal and state regulators  our operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  any adverse finding by survey and inspection officials may serve as the basis for false claims lawsuits by private plaintiffs and may lead to investigations under federal and state laws  which may result in civil and or criminal penalties against the facility or individual 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referrals  relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers  including those in the senior living industry  and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti fraud initiatives 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  and the balanced budget act of expanded the penalties for health care fraud 
in addition  with respect to our participation in federal health care reimbursement programs  the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action under the false claims act alleging that a health care provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties 
recently  other health care providers have faced enforcement action under the false claims act 
the false claims act allows a private individual with knowledge of fraud to bring a claim on behalf of the federal government and earn a percentage of the federal government s recovery 
because of these incentives  so called whistleblower suits have become more frequent 
also  if any of our facilities exceeds its level of care  we may be subject to private lawsuits alleging transfer trauma by residents 
such allegations could also lead to investigations by enforcement officials  which could result in penalties  including the closure of facilities 
the violation of any of these regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could jeopardize our business 
additionally  we operate facilities that participate in federal and or state health care reimbursement programs  including state medicaid waiver programs for assisted living facilities  the medicare skilled nursing facility benefit program and other healthcare programs such as therapy and home health services  or other federal and or state health care programs 
consequently  we are subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for reimbursement which are false  fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
similar state laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted consistently or in keeping with past practices 
violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure  claims for recoupment  civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable federal and or state health care reimbursement program 
loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and or trigger cross defaults 
we are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers  such as the federal anti kickback law  the stark laws and certain state referral laws 
the federal anti kickback law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay or to solicit or receive any remuneration 
directly or indirectly  overtly or covertly  in cash or in kind for referring or recommending for purchase any item or service which is eligible for payment under the medicare and or medicaid programs 
authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral 
if a health care provider were to violate the federal anti kickback law  it may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as medicare and medicaid  which may also cause us to default under our leases and loan agreements and or trigger cross defaults 
adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal stark laws related to certain medicare and medicaid physician referrals 
while we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our senior living communities  it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations 

table of contents we are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information 
the us department of health and human services  or hhs  has issued rules pursuant to hipaa relating to the privacy of such information 
rules that became effective april  govern our use and disclosure of health information at certain hipaa covered facilities 
we established procedures to comply with hipaa privacy requirements at these facilities 
we were required to be in compliance with the hipaa rule establishing administrative  physical and technical security standards for health information by april to the best of our knowledge  we are in compliance with these rules 
environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  such as us  may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances  including  among others  petroleum and materials containing asbestos  that could be located on  in  at or under a property  regardless of how such materials came to be located there 
additionally  such an owner or operator of real property may incur costs relating to the release of hazardous or toxic substances  including government fines and payments for personal injuries or damage to adjacent property 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  mitigation  compliance  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property s value and or our assets value 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the damage caused by such substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell such property  to attract additional residents and retain existing residents  to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property 
in addition  such laws impose liability for investigation  remediation  removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third party sites 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence  release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred 
moreover  the imposit ion of such liability upon us could be joint and several  which means we could be required to pay for the cost of cleaning up contamination caused by others who have become insolvent or otherwise judgment proof 
we do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities as would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws  including those relating to the handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our facilities  identification and warning of the presence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  as well as removal of such materials  the presence of other substances in the indoor environment  and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties 
some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents  including  for example  blood soaked bandages  swabs and other medical waste products and incontinence products of those residents diagnosed with an infectious disease 
the management of infectious medical waste  including its handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal  is subject to regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these environmental laws set forth the management requirements for such waste  as well as related permit  record keeping  notice and reporting obligations 
each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste 
the use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such medical waste laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies  nor does it immunize us from third party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
any finding that we are not in compliance with environmental laws could adversely affect our business operations and financial condition 
federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn  via signs and labels  their employees and certain other employers 
table of contents operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in their buildings 
the regulations also set forth employee training  record keeping requirements and sampling protocols pertaining to asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations 
building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
the regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in which we have invested 
federal  state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal  encapsulation  disturbance  handling and or disposal of asbestos containing materials and poten tial asbestos containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials and may provide for fines to  and for third parties to seek recovery from  owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
the presence of mold  lead based paint  contaminants in drinking water  radon and or other substances at any of the facilities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation  mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan 
furthermore  the presence of mold  lead based paint  contaminants in drinking water  radon and or other substances at any of the facilities we own or may acquire may present a risk that third parties will seek recovery from the owners  operators or tenants of such properties for personal injury or property damage 
in some circumstances  areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs  and even after successful remediation  the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a facility to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a facility s market value 
we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local environmental regulation and legislation 
changes in the environmental regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our facilities

table of contents item a 
risk factors risks related to our business our operating businesses were recently transferred to us  we have a limited operating history on a combined basis  and we are therefore subject to the risks generally associated with the formation of any new business and the combination of existing businesses 
in june  we were formed for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies  brookdale living communities  inc  or blc  and alterra healthcare corporation  or alterra  through a series of mergers that occurred in september prior to this combination  we had no operations or assets 
we are therefore subject to the risks generally associated with the formation of any new business and the combination of existing businesses  including the risk that we will not be able to realize expected efficiencies and economies of scale or implement our business strategies 
as such  we only have a brief combined and consolidated operating history upon which investors may evaluate our performance as an integrated entity and assess our future prospects 
in addition  from the date of our initial public offering in november  we have purchased or have entered into definitive agreements to purchase over additional facilities  including facilities from arc 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate and oversee the combined operations of blc and alterra and the additional facilities purchased in these acquisitions 
accordingly  our financial performance to date may not be indicative of our long term future performance and may not necessarily reflect what our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows would have been had we not operated as separate  stand alone entities pursuing independent strategies during the periods presented 
we have a history of losses and one of our operating subsidiaries  alterra  emerged from chapter bankruptcy reorganization in december  therefore  we may not be able to achieve profitability 
we have incurred net losses in every quarter since our formation in june in addition  alterra emerged from chapter bankruptcy reorganization in december  approximately months after filing a voluntary petition for bankruptcy reorganization  pursuant to which it sought to facilitate and complete its ongoing restructuring initiatives 
prior to its reorganization  alterra s overall cash position had declined to a level that it believed to be insufficient to operate the company 
this resulted in its failure to make certain scheduled debt service and lease payments  which caused it to be in default under several of its principal financing arrangements 
the principal components of alterra s restructuring pl an were to dispose of selected under performing and non strategic assets and to restructure its capital structure 
alterra emerged from bankruptcy in december and in connection with its reorganization  alterra adopted fresh start accounting as of december  given our history of losses and alterra s recent emergence from bankruptcy  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve and or maintain profitability in the future 
if we do not effectively manage our cash flow and combined business operations going forward or otherwise achieve profitability  our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders and our stock price would be adversely affected 
you may not be able to compare our historical financial information to our current financial information  which will make it more difficult to evaluate an investment in our securities 
as a result of alterra s emergence from bankruptcy  we are operating a portion of our business with a new capital structure and have adopted fresh start accounting prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  unlike companies that have not previously filed for bankruptcy protection  a portion of our financial condition and results of operations are not comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in alterra s historical financial statements for periods prior to december  contained in this report 
without historical financial statements to compare to our current performance  it may be more difficult for you to assess our future prospects when evaluating an in vestment in our securities 

table of contents failure to successfully and efficiently integrate the facilities of arc into our operations may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
on july   we completed our acquisition of arc 
our ability to successfully integrate the facilities of arc is uncertain 
the acquisition of arc was significantly larger than any acquisition we have completed since the completion of our initial public offering in november the purchase price of approximately billion in cash represented more than ten times the amount of cash on our balance sheet at march  the integration of arc s facilities into our operations is a significant undertaking  as our resident capacity increased by nearly  and will require significant attention from our management team 
in addition  we have made several assumptions regarding synergies for the combined company  many of which are dependent upon how successful we are in integrating the operations of the two companies 
we have added approximately  additional employees to our operations  including a co chief executive officer and five executive vice presidents  which has increased our labor costs 
in addition  the integration of arc into our operations will require significant one time costs for tasks such as site visits and audits and may be difficult to execute 
additional integration challenges include  among other things

if we are not able to successfully overcome these integration challenges  we may not achieve the benefits we expect from the acquisition of arc  and our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we may encounter difficulties in acquiring facilities at attractive prices or integrating acquisitions with our operations  which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we will continue to target strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise 
the process of integrating acquired facilities into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  divert managerial attention or require significant financial resources 
these acquisitions and other future acquisitions may require us to incur additional indebtedness and contingent liabilities  and may result in unforeseen expenses or compliance issues  which may limit our revenue growth  cash flows  and our ability to achieve profitability and pay dividends to our stockholders 
moreover  any future acquisitions may not generate any additional income for us or provide any benefit to our business 
in addition  we cannot assure you th at we will be able to locate and acquire facilities at attractive prices in locations that are compatible with our strategy or that competition for the acquisition of facilities will not increase 
finally  when we are able to locate facilities and enter into definitive agreements to acquire or lease them  we cannot assure you that the transactions will be completed 
failure to complete transactions after we have entered into definitive agreements may result in significant expenses to us 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest and lease payments  this would result in defaults of the related debt or leases and cross defaults under other debt or leases  which would adversely affect our ability to continue to generate income 
we have significant indebtedness and lease obligations  and we intend to continue financing our facilities through mortgage financing  long term leases and other types of financing  including 
table of contents borrowings under our lines of credit and future credit facilities we may obtain 
we cannot give any assurance that we will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest  principal and lease payments 
any non payment or other default under our financing arrangements could  subject to cure provisions  cause the lender to foreclose upon the facility or facilities securing such indebtedness or  in the case of a lease  cause the lessor to terminate the lease  each with a consequent loss of income and asset value to us 
furthermore  in some cases  indebtedness is secured by both a mortgage on a facility or facilities and a guaranty by us  blc  arc and or alterra 
in the event of a default under one of these scenarios  the lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by declaring all amounts outstanding under the guaranty immediately due and payable  and requiring the respective guarantor to fulfill its obligations to make such payments 
the realization of any of these scenarios would have an adverse effect on our financial condition and capital structure 
additionally  a foreclosure on any of our properties could cause us to recognize taxable income  even if we did not receive any cash proceeds in connection with such foreclosure 
further  because our mortgages and leases generally contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions  a default by us related to one facility could affect a significant number of our facilities and their corresponding financing arrangements and leases 
our indebtedness and long term leases could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to operate our business and our ability to execute our growth strategy 
our level of indebtedness and our long term leases could adversely affect our future operations and or impact our stockholders for several reasons  including  without limitation

our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders may be limited 
our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and to make lease payments on our leases depends upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic conditions  industry cycles and financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
our business might not continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt or to make lease payments on our leases  we may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  sell selected assets  red uce or delay planned capital expenditures or delay or abandon desirable acquisitions 
such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt or to make lease payments on our leases 
the failure to make required payments on our debt or leases or the delay or abandonment of our planned growth strategy could result in an adverse effect on our future ability to generate revenues and sustain profitability 
in addition  any such financing  refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms to us 
our existing credit facilities  mortgage loans and lease arrangements contain covenants that restrict our operations and any default under such facilities  loans or arrangements could result in the acceleration of indebtedness  termination of the leases or cross defaults  any of which would negatively impact our liquidity and inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues 
our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain restrictions and covenants and require us to maintain or satisfy specified financial ratios and coverage tests  including maintaining prescribed net worth levels  leverage ratios and debt service and lease coverage ratios on a consolidated basis  and on 
table of contents a facility or facilities basis based on the debt or lease securing the facilities 
in addition  certain of our leases require us to maintain lease coverage ratios on a lease portfolio basis each as defined in the leases and maintain stockholders equity or tangible net worth amounts 
the debt service coverage ratios are generally calculated as revenues less operating expenses  including an implied management fee and a reserve for capital expenditures  divided by the debt principal and interest or lease payment 
stockholders equity is calculated in accordance with gaap  and in certain circumstances less intangible assets or liabilities  or stockholders equity plus deferred gains from sale leaseback transactions  and deferred entrance fee revenue 
these restrictions may interfere with our ability to obtain financing or to engage in other business activities  which may inhibit our ability to grow our business and increase revenues 
if we fail to comply with any of these requirements  the n the related indebtedness could become immediately due and payable 
we cannot assure you that we could pay this debt if it became due 
our outstanding indebtedness and leases are secured by our facilities and  in certain cases  a guaranty by us  blc  arc and or alterra 
therefore  an event of default under the outstanding indebtedness or leases  subject to cure provisions in certain instances  would give the respective lenders or lessors  as applicable  the right to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable  terminate the lease  foreclose on collateral securing the outstanding indebtedness and leases  and restrict our ability to make additional borrowings under the outstanding indebtedness or continue to operate the properties subject to the lease 
certain of our outstanding indebtedness and leases contain cross default provisions so that a default under certain outstanding indebtedness would cause a default under certain of our leases 
certain of our outstanding indebtedness and leases also restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt 
the substantial majority of our lease arrangements are structured as master leases 
under a master lease  we may lease a large number of geographically dispersed properties through an indivisible lease 
as a result  it is difficult to restructure the composition of the portfolio or economic terms of the lease without the consent of the landlord 
failure to comply with medicare or medicaid provider requirements is a default under several of our master lease and debt financing instruments 
in addition  potential defaults related to an individual property may cause a default of an entire master lease portfolio and could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding indebtedness and other leases  which would have a negative impa ct on our capital structure and our ability to generate future revenues  and could interfere with our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
certain of our master leases also contain radius restrictions  which limit our ability to own  develop or acquire new facilities within a specified distance from certain existing facilities covered by such master leases 
these radius restrictions could negatively affect our acquisition and expansion plans 
mortgage debt and lease obligations expose us to increased risk of loss of property  which could harm our ability to generate future revenues and could have an adverse tax effect 
mortgage debt and lease obligations increase our risk of loss because defaults on indebtedness secured by properties or pursuant to the terms of the lease may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders or lessors and ultimately our loss of the property securing any loans for which we are in default or cause the lessor to terminate the lease 
for tax purposes  a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure  but would not receive any cash proceeds  whic h could negatively impact our earnings 
further  our mortgage debt and leases generally contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions and a default on one facility could affect a significant number of our facilities  financing arrangements and leases 

table of contents if we do not effectively manage our growth  our business  ability to maintain consistent quality control and financial results could be adversely affected 
we plan to grow organically through our existing operations  through selectively purchasing existing senior living operating companies and facilities  through the expansion of our existing facilities  and through the expansion of our ancillary services programs 
this growth has and will continue to place significant demands on our current management resources 
our ability to manage our growth effectively and to successfully integrate new acquisitions and expansions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational  financial and management information systems and to continue to retain  attract  train  motivate and manage key employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attractin g qualified individuals to the extent necessary  and management may expend significant time and energy attracting the appropriate personnel to manage assets we purchase in the future and our expansion activities 
also  the additional facilities and expansion activities will require us to maintain consistent quality control measures that allow our management to effectively identify deviations that result in delivering care and services that are substandard  which may result in litigation and or loss of licensure or certification 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively and successfully integrate new acquisitions and expansions into our existing business or maintain consistent quality control measures  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
unforeseen costs associated with the acquisition of new facilities could reduce our future profitability 
our growth strategy contemplates future acquisitions of existing senior living operating companies and facilities 
despite our extensive underwriting and due diligence procedures  facilities that we may acquire in the future may generate unexpectedly low or no returns or may not meet a risk profile that our investors find acceptable 
in addition  we might encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any of the acquired facilities  including contingent liabilities  or newly acquired facilities might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business 
for example  a facility may require capital expenditures in excess of budgeted amounts  or it may experience manageme nt turnover that is higher than we project 
these costs may negatively affect our future profitability 
competition for the acquisition of strategic assets from buyers with lower costs of capital than us or that have lower return expectations than we do could limit our ability to compete for strategic acquisitions and therefore to grow our business effectively 
several real estate investment trusts  or reits  have similar asset acquisition objectives as we do  along with greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain 
this may increase competition for acquisitions that would be suitable to us  making it more difficult for us to compete and successfully implement our growth strategy 
there is significant competition among potential acquirers in the senior living industry  including reits  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy or complete acquisitions  which could limit our ability to grow our business effectively 
if we are unable to expand our facilities in accordance with our plans  our anticipated revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we are currently working on projects that will expand several of our existing senior living facilities over the next several years 
we are also developing certain new senior living facilities 
these projects are in various stages of development and are subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
such factors include the necessity of arranging separate leases  mortgage loans or other financings to provide the capital required to complete these projects  difficulties or delays in obtaining zoning  land use  building  occupancy  licensing  certificate of need and other required governmental permits and approvals  failure to complete construction of the projects on budget and on schedule  failure of third p arty contractors and subcontractors to perform under their contracts  shortages of labor or materials that could delay projects or make them more expensive  adverse weather conditions that could delay completion of projects  increased costs resulting from general economic conditions or increases in the cost of materials  and increased costs as a result of changes in laws and regulations 

table of contents we cannot assure you that we will elect to undertake or complete all of our proposed expansion and development projects  or that we will not experience delays in completing those projects 
in addition  we may incur substantial costs prior to achieving stabilized occupancy for each such project and cannot assure you that these costs will not be greater than we have anticipated 
we also cannot assure you that any of our development projects will be economically successful 
our failure to achieve our expansion and development plans could adversely impact our growth objectives  and our anticipated revenues and results of operations 
we may need additional capital to fund our operations and finance our growth  and we may not be able to obtain it on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which may limit our ability to grow 
continued expansion of our business through the acquisition of existing senior living operating companies and facilities and expansion of our existing facilities will require additional capital  particularly if we were to accelerate our acquisition and expansion plans 
financing may not be available to us or may be available to us only on terms that are not favorable 
in addition  certain of our outstanding indebtedness and long term leases restrict  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt 
if we are unable to raise additional funds or obtain them on terms acceptable to us  we may have to delay or abandon some or all of our growth strategies 
further  if additional funds are raised through the issuance of addition al equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders would be diluted 
any newly issued equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
we will rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a greater portion of our revenues than before  and will be subject to changes in reimbursement levels  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
we will rely on reimbursement from governmental programs for a greater portion of our revenues than before  and we cannot assure you that reimbursement levels will not decrease in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow 
as of january   certain per person annual limits on medicare reimbursement for therapy services became effective  subject to certain exceptions 
these exceptions may be modified or may not be extended by congress at a future date 
there continue to be various federal and state legislative and regulatory proposals to implement cost containment measures that would limit payments to healthcare providers in the future 
changes in the reimbursement policies of the medic are program could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow 
due to the dependency of our revenues on private pay sources  events which adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our monthly resident fees could cause our occupancy rates  revenues and results of operations to decline 
costs to seniors associated with independent and assisted living services are not generally reimbursable under government reimbursement programs such as medicare and medicaid 
only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the comparable median in the regions where our facilities are located typically can afford to pay our monthly resident fees 
economic downturns or changes in demographics could adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our resident fees 
in addition  downturns in the housing markets would adversely affect the ability of seniors to afford our entrance fees and resident fees as our customers frequently use the proceeds from the sale of their homes to cover the cost of our fees 
if we are unable to retain and or attract seniors with sufficient income  assets or other resources required to pay the fees associated with independent and assisted living services  our occupancy rates  revenues and results of operations would decline 
we are susceptible to risks associated with the lifecare benefits that we offer the residents of our lifecare entrance fee communities 
as of december   we operated seven lifecare entrance fee facilities that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these facilities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the facility 
this limited lifecare benefit is typically a a certain number of free days in the facility s health 
table of contents center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined utilizing actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for our facilities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of these facilities could be adversely affected 
residents of these entrance fee facilities are guaranteed a living unit and nursing care at the facility during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the facility 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the facility where the resident lives  the facility must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although we screen potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to our facilities during their lifetime  we cannot assure yo u that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
if insufficient  we have rights of set off against the refundable portions of the residents deposits  and would also seek available reimbursement under medicaid or other available programs 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that our facilities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of our facilities  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
the geographic concentration of our facilities could leave us vulnerable to an economic downturn  regulatory changes or acts of nature in those areas  resulting in a decrease in our revenues or an increase in our costs  or otherwise negatively impacting our results of operations 
we have a high concentration of facilities in florida  texas and north carolina 
as a result of this concentration  the conditions of local economies and real estate markets  changes in governmental rules and regulations  particularly with respect to assisted living facilities  acts of nature and other factors that may result in a decrease in demand for senior living services in these states could have an adverse effect on our revenues  costs and results of operations 
in addition  given the location of our facilities  we are particularly susceptible to revenue loss  cost increase or damage caused by other severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes  earthquakes or tornados 
any significant loss due to a natu ral disaster may not be covered by insurance and may lead to an increase in the cost of insurance 
termination of our resident agreements and vacancies in the living spaces we lease could adversely affect our revenues  earnings and occupancy levels 
state regulations governing assisted living facilities require written resident agreements with each resident 
several of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice 
consistent with these regulations  several of our assisted living resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements upon to days notice 
unlike typical apartment leasing or independent living arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or longer  in many instances we cannot contract with our assisted living residents to stay in those living spaces for longer periods of time 
our independent living resid ent agreements generally provide for termination of the lease upon death or allow a resident to terminate his or her lease upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the facility 
the resident is usually obligated to pay rent for the lesser of days after the move out or until the unit is rented by another resident 
if multiple residents terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time  our revenues  earnings and occupancy levels could be adversely affected 
in addition  because of the demographics of our typical residents  including age and health  resident turnover rates in our facilities are difficult to predict 
as a result  the living spaces we lease may be unoccupied for a period of time  which could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 

table of contents increased competition for or a shortage of skilled personnel could increase our staffing and labor costs  which would have an adverse effect on our profitability and or our ability to conduct our business operations 
our success depends on our ability to retain and attract skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day to day operations of each of our facilities 
each facility has an executive director responsible for the overall day to day operations of the facility  including quality of care  social services and financial performance 
depending upon the size of the facility  each director is supported by a facility staff member who is directly responsible for day to day care of the residents and either facility staff or regional support to oversee the facility s marketing and community outreach programs 
other key positions supporting each facility may include individuals responsible for food service  healthcare services  therapy services  activities  housekeeping and engineering 
we compete with various health care service providers  including other senior living providers  in retaining and attracting qualified and skilled personnel 
increased competition for or a shortage of nurses  therapists or other trained personnel  or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel 
we may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge to our residents or our service charges 
turnover rates and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses  therapists or other trained personnel varies substantially from facility to facility 
although reliable industry wide data on key employee retention does not exist  we believe that our employee retention rates are consistent with those of other national senior housing operators 
if there is an increase in these costs  our profitability would be negatively affected 
in addition  if we fail to attra ct and retain qualified and skilled personnel  our ability to conduct our business operations effectively  our ability to implement our growth strategy  and our overall operating results could be harmed 
departure of our key officers could harm our business 
our future success depends  to a significant extent  upon the continued service of our senior management personnel  particularly mark j 
schulte  our co chief executive officer  we sheriff  our co chief executive officer  mark w 
ohlendorf  our co president and chief financial officer effective march   and john p 
rijos  our co president 
if we were to lose the services of any of these individuals  our business and financial results could be adversely affected 
increases in market interest rates could significantly increase the costs of our unhedged debt and lease obligations  which could adversely affect our liquidity and earnings 
our unhedged floating rate debt and lease payment obligations and any unhedged floating rate debt incurred in the future  exposes us to interest rate risk 
therefore  increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our payment obligations  which would negatively impact our liquidity and earnings 
we may not be able to pay or maintain dividends and the failure to do so would adversely affect our stock price 
we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock 
however  our ability to pay and maintain cash dividends is based on many factors  including our ability to make and finance growth and acquisitions  our ability to negotiate favorable lease and other contractual terms  anticipated operating expense levels  the level of demand for our units beds  anticipated entrance fee sales and the rates we charge 
actual results may vary substantially from estimates 
some of the factors are beyond our control and a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay or maintain dividends 
we can give no assurance as to our ability to pay or maintain dividends 
we also cannot assure you that the le vel of dividends will be maintained or increase over time or that increases in demand for our units beds and monthly resident fees will increase our actual cash available for dividends to stockholders 
we expect that we will pay dividends that exceed our net income for the applicable quarter as calculated in accordance with gaap 
the failure to pay or maintain dividends would adversely affect our stock price 

table of contents environmental contamination at any of our facilities could result in substantial liabilities to us  which may exceed the value of the underlying assets and which could materially and adversely effect our liquidity and earnings 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  such as us  may be held liable in certain circumstances for the costs of investigation  removal or remediation of  or related to the release of  certain hazardous or toxic substances  that could be located on  in  at or under a property  regardless of how such materials came to be located there 
the cost of any required investigation  remediation  removal  mitigation  compliance  fines or personal or property damages and our liability therefore could exceed the property s value and or our assets value 
in addition  the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly dispose of or remediate the d amage caused by such substances  may adversely affect our ability to sell such property  to attract additional residents and retain existing residents  to borrow using such property as collateral or to develop or redevelop such property 
in addition  such laws impose liability  which may be joint and several  for investigation  remediation  removal and mitigation costs on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at third party sites 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence  release or disposal of such substances as well as without regard to whether such release or disposal was in compliance with law at the time it occurred 
although we do not believe that we have incurred such liabilities as would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  we could be subject to substantial future liability for environmental contaminatio n that we have no knowledge about as of the date of this report and or for which we may not be at fault 
failure to comply with existing environmental laws could result in increased expenditures  litigation and potential loss to our business and in our asset value  which would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
our operations are subject to regulation under various federal  state and local environmental laws  including those relating to the handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of medical waste products generated at our facilities  identification and warning of the presence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  as well as removal of such materials  the presence of other substances in the indoor environment  and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our properties 
some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents 
each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste  but the use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies  nor does it immunize us from third party claims for the cost to cleanup disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn their employees and certain other employers operating in the building of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in their buildings 
significant fines can be assessed for violation of these regulations 
building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits 
federal  state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal  encapsulation  disturbance  handling and or disposal of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials and may provide for fines to  and for third parties to seek recovery from  owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 

table of contents the presence of mold  lead based paint  contaminants in drinking water  radon and or other substances at any of the facilities we own or may acquire may lead to the incurrence of costs for remediation  mitigation or the implementation of an operations and maintenance plan and may result in third party litigation for personal injury or property damage 
furthermore  in some circumstances  areas affected by mold may be unusable for periods of time for repairs  and even after successful remediation  the known prior presence of extensive mold could adversely affect the ability of a facility to retain or attract residents and could adversely affect a facility s market value 
although we believe that we are currently in material compliance with applicable environmental laws  if we fail to comply with such laws in the future  we would face increased expenditures both in terms of fines and remediation of the underlying problem s  potential litigation relating to exposure to such materials  and potential decrease in value to our business and in the value of our underlying assets 
therefore  our failure to comply with existing environmental laws would have an adverse effect on our earnings  our financial condition and our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local environmental regulation and legislation 
changes in the environmental regulatory framework could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our facilities 
we are subject to risks associated with complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of we are subject to various regulatory requirements  including the sarbanes oxley act of under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our management is required to include a report with each annual report on form k regarding our internal controls over financial reporting 
we have implemented processes documenting and evaluating our system of internal controls 
complying with these new requirements is expensive  time consuming and subject to changes in regulatory requirements 
the existence of one or more material weaknesses  management s conclusion that its internal controls over financial reporting are not effective  or the inability of our auditors to express an opinion or attest that our management s report is fairly stated  could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports  adversely affect our stock price and or subject us to sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities 
risks related to pending litigation recent complaints filed against our subsidiary could  if adversely determined  subject us to a material loss 
in connection with the sale of certain facilities to ventas realty limited partnership ventas in  two legal actions have been filed 
the first action was filed on september   by current and former limited partners in investing partnerships in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york captioned david t 
atkins et al 
v 
apollo real estate advisors  lp  et al 
the action 
on march   a third amended complaint was filed in the action 
the third amended complaint is brought on behalf of current and former limited partners in investing partnerships 
it names as defendants  among others  the company  blc  a subsidiary of the company  gfb as investors  llc gfb as  a subsidiary of blc  the general partners of the investing partnerships  which are alleged to be subsidiaries of gfb as  fig  an affiliate of our largest stockholder  and our chief financial officer 
the nine count third amended complaint alleges  among other things  i that the defendants converted for their own use the property of the limited partners of partnerships  including through the failure to obtain consents the plaintiffs contend were required for the sale of facilities indirectly owned by those partnerships to ventas  ii that the defendants fraudulently persuaded the limited partners of three partnerships to give up a valuable property right based upon incomplete  false and misleading statements in connection with certain consent solicitations  iii that certain defendants  including gfb as  the general partners  and our chief fi nancial officer  but not including the company  blc  or fig  committed mail fraud in connection with the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the partnerships at issue in the action to 
table of contents ventas  iv that certain defendants  including gfb as and our chief financial officer  but not including the company  blc  the general partners  or fig  committed wire fraud in connection with certain communications with plaintiffs in the action and another investor in a limited partnership  v that the defendants  with the exception of the company  committed substantive violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico  vi that the defendants conspired to violate rico  vii that gfb as and the general partners violated the partnership agreements of the investing partnerships  viii that gfb as  the general partners  and our chief financial officer breached fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs  and ix that the defendants were unjustly enriched 
the plaintiffs have asked for damages in excess of million on each of the counts described above  including treble damages for the rico claims 
on april   we filed a motion to dismiss the claims with prejudice  which remains pending before the court  and plan to continue to vigorously defend this action 
a putative class action lawsuit was also filed on march   by certain limited partners in four of the same partnerships involved in the action in the court of chancery for the state of delaware captioned edith zimmerman et al 
v 
gfb as investors  llc and brookdale living communities  inc the second action 
on november   an amended complaint was filed in the second action 
the putative class in the second action consists only of those limited partners in the four investing partnerships who are not plaintiffs in the action 
the second action names as defendants blc and gfb as 
the complaint alleges a claim for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the investing partnerships to ventas and the subsequent lease of those facilities by ventas t o subsidiaries of blc 
the plaintiffs seek  among other relief  an accounting  damages in an unspecified amount  and disgorgement of unspecified amounts by which the defendants were allegedly unjustly enriched 
on december   we filed an answer denying the claim asserted in the amended complaint and providing affirmative defenses 
on december   the plaintiffs moved to certify the action as a class action 
both the plaintiffs and defendants have served document production requests and the action is currently in the beginning stages of document discovery 
we also intend to vigorously defend this second action 
because these actions are in an early stage we cannot estimate the possible range of loss  if any 
in addition  we have been involved in other litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business which are comparable to other companies in the senior living industry 
certain claims and lawsuits allege large damage amounts and may require significant legal costs to defend and resolve 
similarly  our industry is continuously subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators  which could result in litigation related to regulatory compliance matters 
as a result  we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate  based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience and industry standards 
risks related to our industry the cost and difficulty of complying with increasing and evolving regulation and enforcement could have an adverse effect on our business operations and profits 
the regulatory environment surrounding the senior living industry continues to evolve and intensify in the amount and type of laws and regulations affecting it  many of which vary from state to state 
in addition  many senior living facilities are subject to regulation and licensing by state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
in several of the states in which we operate or may operate  we are prohibited from providing certain higher levels of senior care services without first obtaining the appropriate licenses 
also  in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate  assisted living facilities and or skilled nursing facilities require a certificate of need before the fac ility can be opened or the services at an existing facility can be expanded 
furthermore  federal  state and local officials are increasingly focusing their efforts on enforcement of these laws  particularly with respect to large for profit  multi facility providers like us 
these requirements  and the increased enforcement thereof  could affect our ability to expand into new markets  to expand our services and facilities in existing markets and  if any of our presently licensed facilities were to operate outside of its licensing authority  may subject us to penalties including closure of the facility 
future regulatory developments as well as mandatory increases in the scope and severity of deficiencies 
table of contents determined by survey or inspection officials could cause our operations to suffer 
we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local legislation or regulation 
if regulatory requirements increase  whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the enforcement of existing rules  our earnings and operations could be adversely affected 
the intensified regulatory and enforcement environment impacts providers like us because of the increase in the number of inspections or surveys by governmental authorities and consequent citations for failure to comply with regulatory requirements 
we also expend considerable resources to respond to federal and state investigations or other enforcement action 
from time to time in the ordinary course of business  we receive deficiency reports from state and federal regulatory bodies resulting from such inspections or surveys 
although most inspection deficiencies are resolved through an agreed to plan of corrective action  the reviewing agency typically has the authority to take further action against a licensed or certified faci lity  which could result in the imposition of fines  imposition of a provisional or conditional license  suspension or revocation of a license  suspension or denial of admissions  loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs or imposition of other sanctions  including criminal penalties 
furthermore  certain states may allow citations in one facility to impact other facilities in the state 
revocation of a license at a given facility could therefore impact our ability to obtain new licenses or to renew existing licenses at other facilities  which may also cause us to be in default under our leases  trigger cross defaults  trigger defaults under certain of our credit agreements or adversely affect our ability to operate and or obtain financing in the future 
if a state were to find that one facility s citation would impact another of our facilities  this would also increase costs and result in increased surveillance by the state survey agency 
to date  none of the deficiency re ports received by us has resulted in a suspension  fine or other disposition that has had a material adverse effect on our revenues 
however  the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements in the future could result in a material adverse effect to our business as a whole 
there are various extremely complex federal and state laws governing a wide array of referral relationships and arrangements and prohibiting fraud by health care providers  including those in the senior living industry  and governmental agencies are devoting increasing attention and resources to such anti fraud initiatives 
some examples are the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  the balanced budget act of  and the false claims act  which gives private individuals the ability to bring an action on behalf of the federal government 
the violation of any of these laws or regulations may result in the imposition of fines or other penalties that could increase our costs and otherwise jeopardize our business 
under the deficit reduction act of  or dra  every entity that receives at least million annually in medicaid payments must establish  by january   written policies for all employees  contractors or agents  providing detailed information about false claims  false statements and whistleblower protections under certain federal laws  including the federal false claims act  and similar state laws 
failure to comply with this new compliance requirement may potentially give rise to potential liability 
dra also creates an incentive for states to enact false claims laws that are comparable to the federal false claims act 
additionally  we provide services and operate facilities that participate in federal and or state health care reimbursement programs  which makes us subject to federal and state laws that prohibit anyone from presenting  or causing to be presented  claims for reimbursement which are false  fraudulent or are for items or services that were not provided as claimed 
similar state laws vary from state to state and we cannot be sure that these laws will be interpreted consistently or in keeping with past practice 
violation of any of these laws can result in loss of licensure  civil or criminal penalties and exclusion of health care providers or suppliers from furnishing covered items or services to beneficiaries of the applicable fede ral and or state health care reimbursement program 
loss of licensure may also cause us to default under our leases and or trigger cross defaults 
we are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers  such as the federal anti kickback law  the stark laws and certain state referral laws 
authorities have interpreted the federal anti kickback law very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral 
this could result in criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from government 
table of contents programs such as medicare and medicaid  which may also cause us to default under our leases and or trigger cross defaults 
adverse consequences may also result if we violate federal stark laws related to certain medicare and medicaid physician referrals 
while we endeavor to comply with all laws that regulate the licensure and operation of our business  it is difficult to predict how our revenues could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging such violations 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act  fair housing act and fire  safety and other regulations may require us to make unanticipated expenditures  which could increase our costs and therefore adversely affect our earnings  financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders 
all of our facilities are required to comply with the americans with disabilities act  or ada 
the ada has separate compliance requirements for public accommodations and commercial properties  but generally requires that buildings be made accessible to people with disabilities 
compliance with ada requirements could require removal of access barriers and non compliance could result in imposition of government fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we must also comply with the fair housing act  which prohibits us from discriminating against individuals on certain bases in any of our practices if it would cause such individuals to face barriers in gaining residency in any of our facilities 
additionally  the fair housing act and other state laws require that we advertise our services in such a way that we promote diversity and not limit it 
we may be required  among other things  to change our marketing techniques to comply with these requirements 
in addition  we are required to operate our facilities in compliance with applicable fire and safety regulations  building codes and other land use regulations and food licensing or certification requirements as they may be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies from time to time 
like other health care facilities  senior living facilities are subject to periodic survey or inspection by governmental authorities to assess and assure compliance with regulatory requirements 
surveys occur on a regular often annual or bi annual schedule  and special surveys may result from a specific complaint filed by a resident  a family member or one of our competitors 
we may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply wi th those requirements 
capital expenditures we have made to comply with any of the above to date have been immaterial  however  the increased costs and capital expenditures that we may incur in order to comply with any of the above would result in a negative effect on our earnings  financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders 
significant legal actions and liability claims against us in excess of insurance limits could subject us to increased operating costs and substantial uninsured liabilities  which may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results 
the senior living business entails an inherent risk of liability  particularly given the demographics of our residents  including age and health  and the services we provide 
in recent years  we  as well as other participants in our industry  have been subject to an increasing number of claims and lawsuits alleging that our services have resulted in resident injury or other adverse effects 
many of these lawsuits involve large damage claims and significant legal costs 
many states continue to consider tort reform and how it will apply to the senior living industry 
we may continue to be faced with the threat of large jury verdicts in jurisdictions that do not find favor with large senior living providers 
we maintain liability ins urance policies in amounts and with the coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience and industry standards 
we have formed a wholly owned captive insurance company for the purpose of insuring certain portions of our risk retention under our general and professional liability insurance programs 
for the year ended december   we did not have any claims that exceeded our policy limits 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will not have such claims in the future 
if a successful claim is made against us and it is not covered by our insurance or exceeds the policy limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in some states  state law may prohibit or limit insurance coverage for the risk of punitive 
table of contents damages arising from professional liability and general liability claims and or litigation 
as a result  we may be liable for punitive damage awards in these states that either are not covered or are in excess of our insurance policy limits 
also  the above deductibles  or self insured retention  are accrued based on an actuarial projection of future liabilities 
if these projections are inaccurate and if there are an unexpectedly large number of successful claims that result in liabilities in excess of our self insured retention  our operating results could be negatively affected 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract residents or expand our business and could require our management to devote time to matters unrelated to the day to day operation of our business 
we also have to renew our policies every year and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage  exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets  includ ing the possibility of rate increases 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain liability insurance in the future or  if available  that such coverage will be available on acceptable terms 
overbuilding  increased competition and increased operating costs may adversely affect our ability to generate and increase our revenues and profits and to pursue our growth strategy 
the senior living industry is highly competitive  and we expect that it may become more competitive in the future 
we compete with numerous other companies that provide long term care alternatives such as home healthcare agencies  therapy services  life care at home  facility based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing providers  including not for profit entities 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent living and assisted living segments of the senior living industry are not substantial 
we have experienced and expect to continue to experience increased competition in our efforts to acquire and oper ate senior living facilities 
consequently  we may encounter increased competition that could limit our ability to attract new residents  raise resident fees or expand our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
in addition  overbuilding in the late s in the senior living industry reduced the occupancy rates of many newly constructed buildings and  in some cases  reduced the monthly rate that some newly built and previously existing facilities were able to obtain for their services 
this resulted in lower revenues for certain of our facilities during that time 
while we believe that overbuilt markets have stabilized and should continue to be stabilized for the immediate future  we cannot be certain that the effects of this period of overbuilding will not effect our occupancy and resident fee rate levels in the future  nor can we be certain that another period of overbuilding in the future will not have the same effects 
moreover  whil e we believe that the new construction dynamics and the competitive environments in the states in which we operate are substantially similar to the national market  taken as a whole  if the dynamics or environment were to be significantly adverse in one or more of those states  it would have a disproportionate effect on our revenues due to the large portion of our revenues that are generated in those states 
risks related to our organization and structure if the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated  it may prevent you and other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest 
as of december   funds managed by affiliates of fortress beneficially own  shares  or approximately  of our common stock 
in addition  two of our directors are associated with fortress 
as a result  funds managed by affiliates of fortress are able to control fundamental and significant corporate matters and transactions  including the election of directors  mergers  consolidations or acquisitions  the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure  the amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated by laws  and the dissolution of the company 
fortress s interests  including its ownership of the north american operations of holiday retirement corp  may conflict with your interests 
their control of the company could delay  deter or prevent acts that may be favored by our other stockholders such as hostile takeovers  changes in control of the company and changes in management 
as a result of such actions  the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium for their shares in connection with a change of control of the company

additionally  our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that section of the delaware general corporation law  which restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders in certain situations  will not apply to us 
this may make it easier for a third party to acquire an interest in some or all of us with fortress approval  even though our other stockholders may not deem such an acquisition beneficial to their interests

future offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the future  we may attempt to increase our capital resources by offering debt or additional equity securities  including commercial paper  medium term notes  senior or subordinated notes  series of preferred shares or shares of our common stock 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and preferred shares  and lenders with respect to other borrowings  would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
preferred shares  if issued  could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  holders of our common stock bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their share holdings in us 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  shares of common stock authorized but unissued and not otherwise reserved for issuance under our stock incentive plans 
we may issue all of these shares without any action or approval by our stockholders 
we intend to continue to actively pursue acquisitions of senior living facilities and may issue shares of common stock in connection with these acquisitions 
any shares issued in connection with our acquisitions  or otherwise would dilute the holdings of our current stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets 
at march   there are  shares of our common stock outstanding 
all of the shares of our common stock are freely transferable  except for any shares held by our affiliates  as that term is defined in rule under the securities act of  as amended  or the securities act  or any shares otherwise subject to the limitations of rule pursuant to our stockholders agreement  fortress and certain of its related partnerships and permitted third party transferees have the right  in certain circumstances  to require us to register their shares of our common stock under the securities act for sale into the public markets 
upon the effectiveness of such a registration statement  all shares covered by the registration statement will be freely transferable 

table of contents in addition  following the completion of our initial public offering  we filed a registration statement on form s under the securities act to register an aggregate of  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under our stock incentive programs 
in accordance with the terms of the plan  the number of shares available for issuance increased by  shares on each of january  and january  on june   in connection with the initial  share increase and the shares we planned to issue to certain officers and employees of arc in connection with the arc merger  we filed an amendment to our registration statement on form s to register an additional  shares of our common stoc k to be reserved for issuance under our stock incentive programs 
subject to any restrictions imposed on the shares and options granted under our stock incentive programs  shares registered under the registration statement on form s and on the amendment to form s will be available for sale into the public markets 
the market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock if fortress  our largest stockholder  defaults under credit agreements secured by its holdings of shares of our common stock 
on june   fortress informed us of the following two affiliates of fortress  frit holdings llc and fit holdings llc entered into separate credit agreements  both dated june   with deutsche bank ag  london branch  or deutsche bank  as administrative agent and sole lender 
pursuant to these credit agreements  the affiliates have received an aggregate commitment of approximately billion from deutsche bank  and this amount has been secured by  among other things  a pledge by the borrowers and one other affiliate of fortress of a total of  shares of our common stock owned by such affiliates 
the  shares of common stock represented approximately of our issued and outstanding common stock as of june   and approximately as of decemb er  the credit agreements contain customary default provisions and also require prepayment or cash collateralization of a portion of the borrowings by the borrowers in the event the trading price of our common stock decreases below certain specified levels 
in the event of a default under the credit agreements by the borrowers  deutsche bank may foreclose upon any and all shares of our common stock pledged to it 
the sale of these pledged shares by the affiliates of fortress in the event of a default could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares 
the borrowers have agreed in the credit agreements that if a shelf registration statement is not effective and usable for resale of any portion of the pledged common stock by deutsche bank in the event of foreclosure as of june   the applicable affiliate will prepay or cash collateralize a related portion of the borrowings 
we have also agreed in the credit agreements that if ric coinvestment fund lp or any of its affiliates sell any shares of common stock received pursuant to the investment agreement the borrowers will prepay or cash collateralize a related portion of the borrowings 
in connection with our obligations under the stockholders agreement  we received a request from fortress to file a registration statement on form s to permit the registration of the sale of up to  shares of common stock that fortress or certain of its affiliates have pledged as collateral in connection with the credit agreements 
we filed the registration statement on form s on december  we are not a party to the credit agreements and have no obligations thereunder

doniger  the vice chairman of our board of directors  is a managing director of fortress 
fluctuation of market interest rates may have an adverse effect on the value of your investment in our common stock 
one of the factors that investors may consider in deciding whether to buy or sell our common stock is our dividend payment per share as a percentage of our share price relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective investors may desire a higher rate of return on our 
table of contents common stock and therefore may seek securities paying higher dividends or interest or offering a higher rate of return than shares of our common stock 
as a result  market interest rate fluctuations and other capital market conditions can affect the demand for and market value of our common stock 
for instance  if interest rates rise  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will decrease  because current stockholders and potential investors will likely require a higher dividend yield and rate of return on our common stock as interest bearing securities  such as bonds  offer more attractive returns

a significant majority of our owned properties are subject to mortgages 
corporate offices our main corporate offices are all leased  including our  square foot corporate headquarters facility in chicago  illinois  our  square foot facility in nashville  tennessee and our  not including space to be occupied in march square foot facility in milwaukee  wisconsin 
item legal proceedings in connection with the sale of certain facilities to ventas realty limited partnership ventas in  two legal actions have been filed 
the first action was filed on september   by current and former limited partners in investing partnerships in the united states district court for the eastern district of new york captioned david t 
atkins et al 
v 
apollo real estate advisors  lp  et al 
the action 
on march   a third amended complaint was filed in the action 
the third amended complaint is brought on behalf of current and former limited partners in investing partnerships 
it names as defendants  among others  the company  blc  a subsidiary of the company  gfb as investors  llc gfb as  a subsidiary of blc  the general partners of the investing partnerships  which are alleged to be subsidiaries of gfb as  fig  an affiliate of our largest stockholder  and our chief financial officer 
the nine count third amended complaint alleges  among other things  i that the defendants converted for their own use the property of the limited partners of partnerships  including through the failure to obtain consents the plaintiffs contend were required for the sale of facilities indirectly owned by those partnerships to ventas  ii that the defendants fraudulently persuaded the limited partners of three partnerships to give up a valuable property right based upon incomplete  false and misleading statements in connection with certain consent solicitations  iii that certain defendants  including gfb as  the general partners  and our chief fi nancial officer  but not including the company  blc  or fig  committed mail fraud in connection with the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the partnerships at issue in the action to ventas  iv that certain defendants  including gfb as and our chief financial officer  but not including the company  blc  the general partners  or fig  committed wire fraud in connection with certain communications with plaintiffs in the action and another investor in a limited partnership  v that the defendants  with the exception of the company  committed substantive violations of the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico  vi that the defendants conspired to violate rico  vii that gfb as and the general partners violated the partnership agreements of the investing partnerships  viii that gfb as  the general partners  and our chief financial officer breached fiduciary duties to the plaintiffs  and ix that the defendants were unjustly enriched 
the plaintiffs have asked for damages in excess of million on each of the counts described above  including treble damages for the rico claims 
on april   we filed a motion to dismiss the claims with prejudice  which remains pending before the court  and plan to continue to vigorously defend this action 
a putative class action lawsuit was also filed on march   by certain limited partners in four of the same partnerships involved in the action in the court of chancery for the state of delaware captioned edith zimmerman et al 
v 
gfb as investors  llc and brookdale living communities  inc the second action 
on november   an amended complaint was filed in the second action 
the putative class in the second action consists only of those limited partners in the four investing partnerships who are not plaintiffs in the action 
the second action 
table of contents names as defendants blc and gfb as 
the complaint alleges a claim for breach of fiduciary duty arising out of the sale of facilities indirectly owned by the investing partnerships to ventas and the subsequent lease of those facilities by ventas to subsidiaries of blc 
the plaintiffs seek  among other relief  an accounting  damages in an unspecified amount  and disgorgement of unspecified amounts by which the defendants were allegedly unjustly enriched 
on december   we filed an answer denying the claim asserted in the amended complaint and providing affirmative defenses 
on december   the plaintiffs moved to certify the action as a class action 
both the plaintiffs and defendants have served document production requests and the action is currently in the beginning stages of document discovery 
we also intend to vigorously defend this second action 
because these actions are in an early stage we cannot estimate the possible range of loss  if any 
in addition  we have been involved in other litigation and claims incidental to the conduct of our business which are comparable to other companies in the senior living industry 
certain claims and lawsuits allege large damage amounts and may require significant legal costs to defend and resolve 
similarly  our industry is continuously subject to scrutiny by governmental regulators  which could result in litigation related to regulatory compliance matters 
as a result  we maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles we believe are adequate  based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience and industry standards

prior to our initial public offering  we also paid a dividend of per share to our stockholders on september  the closing sale price of our common stock as reported on the nyse on march  was per share 
as of that date  there were approximately holders of record of our common stock 
dividend policy we intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends to the holders of our common stock 
however  our ability to pay and maintain cash dividends is based on many factors  including our ability to make and finance acquisitions  our ability to negotiate favorable lease and other contractual terms  anticipated operating expense levels  the level of demand for our units beds  the rates we charge and actual results that may vary substantially from estimates 
some of the factors are beyond our control and a change in any such factor could affect our ability to pay or maintain dividends 
we can give no assurance as to our ability to pay or maintain dividends 
we also cannot assure you that the level of dividends will be maintained or increase over time or that increases in demand for our units beds and monthly resident fees will increase our actual cash available for dividends to stockholders 
we expect to pay dividends that exceed our net income for the relevant period as calculated in accordance with gaap 
the failure to pay or maintain dividends would adversely affect our stock price 
recent sales of unregistered securities on july   pursuant to a previously executed investment agreement  we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to ric coinvestment fund lp  a delaware limited partnership the investor  which is a fund managed by an affiliate of fortress  our largest stockholder  for a cash price of per share  resulting in approximately million of gross proceeds to us 
the issuance of these securities was made pursuant to an exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of  as amended

earnings per share for periods prior to our formation on september  have been presented as if the common shares described in note to the consolidated and combined financial statements had been issued and were outstanding for the periods in which fig controlled blc  alterra  fit ren and fortress ccrc 
prior to september   non fig shareholders have been presented as minority interests 
prior to october   we qualified for hedge accounting on designated swap investments pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  with the effective portion of the change in fair value of the derivative recorded in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion included in the change in fair value of derivatives in the statement of operations 
on october   we elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the previously designated swap instruments 
consequently  the gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income at that date related to the previously designated swap instruments are being amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying hedged debt 
in the future  if the underlying hedged debt is extinguished or refinanced  the remaining unamortized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in net income 
although hedge accounting was discontinued on october   the swap instruments remain outstanding and are carried at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet and the change in fair value beginning october  has been included in the consolidated statement of operations

factors that could cause such differences include those described in risk factors and elsewhe re in this annual report on form k 
executive overview as of december   we are the largest operator of senior living facilities in the united states based on total capacity with facilities in states and the ability to serve over  residents 
we offer our residents access to a full continuum of services across all sectors of the senior living industry 
as of december   we operated four business segments in which we have independent living facilities with  units beds  assisted living facilities with  units beds  continuing care retirement communities  or ccrcs  with  units beds and facilities with  units beds for our management services 
as of december   our facilities were occupied 
we generate over of o ur revenues from private pay customers 
in addition  we control all financial and operational decisions regarding our facilities through property ownership and long term leases 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our debt and lease agreements 
we believe we operate in the most attractive sectors of the senior living industry with significant opportunities to increase our revenues through providing a combination of housing  hospitality services and health care services 
for the year ended december   of our revenues were generated from owned facilities  from leased facilities and from management fees from facilities we operate on behalf of third parties 
we were formed in june for the purpose of combining two leading senior living operating companies  brookdale living communities  inc  or blc  and alterra healthcare corporation  or alterra 
blc and alterra had been operating independently since and  respectively 
since december  blc and alterra were under the common control of fortress investment group fortress 
as of december   funds managed by affiliates of fortress beneficially own  shares  or approximately  of our common stock 
on november   we completed our initial public offering and on july   we completed a follow on equity offering in connection with the acquisition of arc 
on july   pursuant to a previously executed investment agreement  we sold shares of our common stock to ric coinvestment fund lp  which is a fund managed by an affiliate of fortress 
the proceeds from the sale were used to partially fund the acquisition of arc 
we plan to grow our revenue and operating income through a combination of i organic growth in our existing portfolio  ii acquisitions of additional operating companies and facilities  iii expansion of our ancillary service programs including therapy and home health services  iv expansion of our existing facilities  and v the realization of economies of scale 
given the size and breadth of our nationwide platform  we believe that we are well positioned to invest in a broad spectrum of assets in the senior living industry  including independent living  assisted living  ccrc and skilled nursing assets 
from january through december   we commenced leasing or acquired the ownership or management of senio r living facilities not including those facilities we acquired and subsequently disposed of with approximately  units beds 
since our initial public offering in november  we have purchased or committed to purchase approximately billion in senior housing assets representing facilities with approximately  units beds 
our senior living facilities offer residents a supportive home like setting  assistance with activities of daily living  or adls  and  in a few facilities  licensed skilled nursing services 
we also provide ancillary services  including therapy services  to our residents 
by providing residents with a 
table of contents range of service options as their needs change  we provide greater continuity of care  enabling seniors to age in place and thereby maintain residency with us for a longer period of time 
the ability of residents to age in place is also beneficial to our residents and their families who are burdened with care decisions for their elderly relatives 
overbuilding in the late s in the senior living industry put downward pressure on the occupancy rates and the resident fees of certain senior living providers 
the slowdown in construction and lack of construction financing since has led to a reduction in the supply of new units being constructed 
growing demand for senior living services has resulted in a recent trend towards increasing occupancy rates and resident fees for operators of existing facilities 
growing consumer awareness among seniors and their families concerning the types of services provided by independent and assisted living operators has further contributed to the opportunities in the senior living industry 
also  seniors currently possess greater financial resources than in the past  which makes it more likely that they are able to afford to live in market rate senior housing 
seniors in the geographic areas in which we operate tend to have a significant amount of assets generated from savings  pensions and  despite recent weakening in national housing markets  equity from the sale of private homes 
challenges in our industry include increased state and local regulation of the assisted living industry  which has led to an increase in the cost of doing business 
the regulatory environment continues to intensify in the number and types of laws and regulations affecting us  accompanied by increased enforcement activity by state and local officials 
in addition  like other companies  our financial results may be negatively impacted by increasing employment costs including salaries  wages and benefits  such as health care  for our employees 
increases in the costs of utilities and real estate taxes may also have a negative impact on our financial results 
historically  we have leased facilities under long term leases 
we intend to finance our future acquisitions primarily through a combination of traditional mortgage debt and equity and to reduce our use of sale leaseback transactions 
as a result  we expect the overall percentage of our revenues derived from our leased portfolio to decline 
from a business standpoint  there is no fundamental difference in the way we manage the operations of our leased versus owned facilities  while from a financial standpoint  financing future acquisitions with traditional mortgage financing and equity is expected to generate more cash flow to distribute to our stockholders and the opportunity to generate additional proceeds from future refinancin g opportunities 
due to the fact that we are an acquisition focused company  as we evaluate operating companies and facilities for potential acquisition  we incur costs both internally and for various third parties assistance  including in connection with due diligence  negotiation and structuring of these acquisitions 
these third party costs are capitalized once the acquisition is deemed probable 
if an acquisition is abandoned  these costs will be expensed 
if the acquisition is consummated  these third party costs will be capitalized as a part of the total purchase price 
acquisition of american retirement corporation on july   we completed the acquisition of arc 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we acquired all outstanding shares of arc for an aggregate purchase price of approximately billion  or per share  in cash  plus the assumption of million of debt and capitalized lease obligations the arc merger 
in connection with the arc merger  ric coinvestment fund lp  a fund managed by an affiliate of fortress investor  committed to purchase up to billion in the aggregate of our common stock at a price of per share 
prior to closing the arc merger  we exercised our right to reduce the investor s commitment to million and on july   issued the investor  of our common stock at per share for aggregate net proceeds of million 
the acquisition of arc was recorded using the purchase method and the purchase price was allocated to arc s assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values 
on july   in connection with the arc merger  we completed a follow on equity offering pursuant to which we issued and sold  primary shares  and an existing stockholder  health 
table of contents partners  which is an affiliate of capital z partners  sold  shares including  shares pursuant to the option granted by health partners to the underwriters to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock to cover over allotments 
the shares were issued at a price of per common share 
we did not receive any proceeds from the shares sold by health partners 
in connection with the acquisition of arc  certain executives of arc purchased  shares of our common stock at per share 
in connection with the follow on equity offering  we received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting an aggregate of million in underwriting discounts and commissions paid to the underwriters and million in other direct expenses incurred in connection with the offering 
funds managed by affiliates of fortress  which beneficially owned over of our common stock prior to the consummation of the offering  did not sell any shares in the offering and after completion of the offering continued to own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the arc merger and other acquisitions 
segments we currently have four reportable segments independent living  assisted living  retirement centers ccrcs  and management services 
these segments were determined based on the way that our chief operating decision makers organize our business activities for making operating decisions and assessing performance 
in connection with the integration of arc s operations into our business  which increased our resident capacity nearly  we have recently reorganized our operating divisions into the chicago operating group  the milwaukee operating group and the nashville operating group 
the chicago operating group is now primarily responsible for the operation of our independent living facilities  the milwaukee operating group is now primarily responsible for the operation of our freestanding assisted living facilities including memory care facilities and the nashville operating group is now primarily responsible for the operation of our retirement centers ccrc facilities 
in light of these organizational changes  we determined that it was necessary to revise our reportable segments to correspond to the new operating group structure 
we have retained the management services segment  as the organizational changes detailed above did not impact that segment 
our management services segment includes the results of facilities that we operate on behalf of third parties pursuant to management agreements 
independent living 
our independent living facilities are primarily designed for middle to upper income senior citizens age and older who desire an upscale residential environment providing the highest quality of service 
the majority of our independent living facilities consist of both independent living and assisted living units in a single facility  which allows residents to age in place by providing them with a continuum of senior independent and assisted living services 
our independent living facilities are large multi story buildings containing an average capacity of units beds 
as of december   our independent living segment operated independent living facilities  with an aggregate capacity of  units beds  representing approximately of the total unit bed capacity of our facilities 
assisted living 
our assisted living facilities offer housing and hour assistance with activities of daily life adls to mid acuity frail and elderly residents 
our assisted living facilities include both freestanding  multi story facilities with more than beds and smaller  freestanding single story facilities with less than beds 
we also operate memory care facilities  which are freestanding assisted living facilities specially designed for residents with alzheimer s disease and other dementias 
our memory care facilities have from to beds and some are part of a campus setting  which includes a freestanding assisted living facility 
as of december   our assisted living segment operated assisted living facilities including memory care facilities  with an aggregate capacity of  units beds  representing approximately of the total unit bed capacity of o ur facilities 
retirement centers ccrcs 
our retirement centers ccrcs are large communities that offer a variety of living arrangements and services to accommodate all levels of physical ability and health 

table of contents most of our retirement centers ccrcs are larger campuses that have independent living  assisted living and skilled nursing 
as of december   our retirement centers ccrcs segment operated facilities  with an aggregate capacity of  units beds  representing approximately of the total unit bed capacity of our facilities 
management services 
our management services segment includes facilities owned by third parties and affiliates and operated by us pursuant to management agreements 
under our management agreements for these facilities  we receive management fees as well as reimbursed expenses  which represent the reimbursement of certain expenses we incur on behalf of the owners 
as of december   these facilities had an aggregate capacity of  units beds  representing approximately of the total unit bed capacity of our facilities 
revenues we generate all of our revenues from resident fees including monthly service fees  amortization of entrance fees and ancillary services fees and management fees 
for the years ended december   and  approximately and  and  and and of our revenues were generated from resident fees and management fees  respectively 
resident fees 
we generate resident fee revenue on a monthly basis from each resident in each facility that we own and operate or lease and operate 
the rates we charge are highly dependent on local market conditions and the competitive environment in which the facilities operate 
substantially all of our independent and assisted living residency agreements allow for adjustments in the monthly fee payable thereunder not less frequently than every or months  or monthly  respectively  thereby enabling us to seek increases in monthly fees due to inflation  increased levels of care or other factors 
any such pricing increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy in the facilities 
in addition  regulations governing assisted living facilities in several states stipulate that each resident must have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reason able notice 
consistent with these regulations  a majority of our assisted living resident agreements allow residents to terminate their agreements upon to days notice 
our independent living facilities generally allow residents to terminate their leases upon the need for a higher level of care not provided at the facility or death 
upon termination of a lease  the resident is usually obligated to pay rent for the lesser of days after he or she vacates the unit or until the unit is rented by another resident 
we derive over of our resident fees from private pay sources 
our resident fees are generally paid on a monthly basis in advance  by residents  their families or other responsible parties  typically out of personal income  assets or other savings 
as a result  economic downturns or changes in demographics  among other things  could impact our ability to charge and collect resident fees 
charges for ancillary services provided to our residents are billed in arrears 
on average  for the years ended december   and  we generated resident fees  excluding amortization of entrance fees  of approximately   and  per unit bed per month  respectively  and approximately  million  million and million  respectively  in aggregate resident fee revenue 
the increases were primarily attributable to and acquisitions along with increases in occupancy rates and ancillary services 
ten of our retirement centers ccrcs are entrance fee communities  in which residents in the independent living apartment units pay a one time upfront entrance fee 
the non refundable portion of the entrance fee is recorded as deferred revenue and amortized over the estimated stay of the resident based upon an actuarial valuation 
the refundable portion is generally refundable upon the sale of the unit  or in certain agreements upon the resale of a comparable unit or months after the resident vacates the unit 
in certain facilities  the resident receives a percentage of the appreciation of the unit upon resale of the unit 
all refundable amounts due to residents at any time in the future are classified as current liabilities 
management fees 
management fees are monthly fees that we collect from owners of facilities for which we are the manager 
management fees typically range from to of the facility s 
table of contents total gross revenues 
all management fees are recognized as revenues when services are provided 
for the years ended december   and  we earned approximately million  million and million  respectively  in management fee revenue 
the terms of our management agreements generally range from one to three years and can be cancelled by the property owners for cause  sale of the facility or upon to days notice at renewal 
operating expenses we classify our operating expenses into the following categories i facility operating expenses  which include labor  food  marketing and other direct facility expenses  insurance and real estate taxes  ii general and administrative expenses  which primarily include the cost to staff and maintain our corporate headquarters  our regional and divisional operating infrastructure and other overhead costs  iii facility lease payments  and iv depreciation and amortization 
recent acquisition activity our financial results are impacted by the timing  size and number of acquisitions  leases and sale leasebacks we complete in a period 
from january through december  the number of facilities we owned  leased or managed increased by  which resulted in an increase of approximately  units beds  for an aggregate purchase price or lease value of approximately billion 
the following is a summary of our recent acquisition activity

this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in the fair value liability of the interest rate swaps from december  to december  liquidity and capital resources we had million of cash and cash equivalents at december   excluding cash and investments restricted and lease security deposits of million 
in addition  we had million available under our credit facility 
as discussed below  we had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million for the year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of million was primarily due to the arc merger and additional acquisitions during  a full year s operations of the acquisitions and improved operating results at our same store facilities 
changes in current assets and current liabilities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of collections of resident fees and payment of operating expenses  including salaries and wages  real estate taxes and insurance 
net cash used in investing activities was  million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during the year ended december  we used 
table of contents  million for acquisitions and to fund capital improvements at our existing facilities partially offset by the reduction in cash and investments restricted and lease security deposits

during the year ended december   we received million from issuance of common stock from our initial public offering  million of net proceeds from debt primarily as a result of the debt incurred in connection with the purchase of the fortress ccr c  prudential  capstead  omega and merrill gardens portfolios and refinancing of the five development facilities and million of equity contributed by fortress in connection with the purchase of the fortress ccrc portfolio and the prudential portfolio  partially offset by the repayment of million of debt  the payment of a million dividend to fortress by alterra and the payment of a million dividend in october to date we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations and both short and long term borrowings 
we financed our acquisitions with long term borrowings  draws on our credit facility  equity contributed by fortress  and proceeds from our public equity offerings 
in connection with the formation transactions  fortress contributed the prudential portfolio and the fortress ccrc portfolio to us in exchange for shares of our common stock 
at december   we had  million of debt outstanding  including capital lease obligations  excluding our line of credit  at a weighted average interest rate of  of which million is due in the next months 
in november we entered into a million amended and restated credit agreement  consisting of a million revolving loan facility with a million letter of credit sublimit  and an million letter of credit facility 
see credit facility below 
at december   million was drawn on the revolving loan facility and million of letters of credit have been issued 
our liquidity requirements have historically arisen from  and we expect they will continue to arise from  working capital  general and administrative costs  debt service and lease payments  acquisition costs  employee compensation and related benefits  capital improvements and dividend payments 
in the past  we have met our cash requirements for operations using cash flows from operating revenues  the receipt of resident fees and the receipt of management fees from third party managed facilities 
in addition to using cash flows from operating revenues  we use available funds from our indebtedness and long term leasing of our facilities to meet our cash obligations 
the primary use of our cash is for operating costs  which includes debt service and lease payments and capital expenditures 
we currently estimate that our existing cash flows from operations  together with existing working capital  and the proceeds of the credit facility we recently entered into will be sufficient to fund our short term liquidity needs 
for the year ending december   in addition to our normal recurring capital expenditures  we expect to spend approximately million for major capital projects and renovations at our existing and recently acquired facilities including projects related to the implementation of our ancillary services program 
we presently estimate that we will also spend approximately million for corporate branding  integration of corporate functions and enhancements of our infrastructure operations 
the source of these funds will be from operations and financings 
there can be no assurance that financing or refinancing will be available to us or available on acceptable terms 
we expect to fund the growth of our business through cash flows from operations and cash flows from financing activities  such as equity offerings  and through the incurrence of additional indebtedness or leasing arrangements 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we enter into an acquisition or strategic arrangement with another 
table of contents company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any such sale of additional equity securities will dilute the interests of our existing stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our business development activities  which could harm the growth of our business 
in addition  we may incur additional indebtedness or lease financing to fund future dividends 
our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements depend on numerous factors  including our operating results  our ability to acquire new facilities  general economic conditions and the cost of capital 
cash flows we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
these amounts exclude cash and investments restricted and lease security deposits totaling million  million and million  respectively  escrowed pursuant to the terms of our indebtedness  leases  interest rate swaps and residency agreements and insurance programs 
restricted cash amounts are generally available to pay real estate taxes and insurance premiums  reimbursements of capital improvements and refundable tenant security deposits  and to collateralize our debt  lease and self insured retention obligations

we have committed to fund the construction of a free standing assisted living community for an unrelated non profit entity 
we expect to finance this commitment through internal sources and a construction loan from a commercial bank 
company indebtedness  long term leases and hedging agreements indebtedness as of december   and  our outstanding property specific debt was approximately  million  million and million  respectively 
the increase from december  to december  was primarily due to debt incurred or assumed to fund our acquisitions of approximately million of indebtedness  including first mortgage loans 
the increase from december  to december  was primarily due to debt incurred to fund the acquisition of the fortress ccrc  prudential  omega  merrill gardens and chambrel portfolios and the refinancing of our million guaranty bank loan  partially offset by scheduled principal payments and repayment of debt from the proceeds of our initial public offering 
on november   we entered into the amended credit agreement 
see credit facility above 
we have secured our self insured retention risk under our workers compensation and general liability and professional liability programs and our lease security deposits with million and million of cash and letters of credit at december   respectively 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our outstanding debt  including those covenants measuring facility operating income to gauge debt coverage 

table of contents long term leases we have historically financed our acquisitions and current portfolio with a combination of mortgage financing and long term leases 
our strategy going forward is to generally finance acquisitions through traditional mortgage financing of up to of the cost of a facility  with the balance in the form of our equity 
the source of equity is expected to be from current cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations  lines of credit  refinancing of our existing facilities  joint ventures or additional equity offerings 
as of december   we have facilities under long term leases 
the leased facilities are generally fixed rate leases with annual escalators that are either fixed or tied to the consumer price index 
the following two leases have or had a floating rate debt component built into the lease payment we acquired the chambrel portfolio from capstead on december  prior to the acquisition  the chambrel portfolio lease payment was a pass through of debt service  which includes million of floating rate tax exempt debt that is credit enhanced by fannie mae and subject to interest rate caps at and million of fixed rate debt  and a stated equity return subject to annual escalation based on the cpi 
one lease contains million of variable rate mortgages  which includes million of floating rate tax exempt debt that is credit enhanced by freddie mac 
the payments under the lease are capped at a weighted average rate of 
the balance is hedged by an interest rate swap 
for the year ended december   our minimum annual lease payments for our capital and financing leases and operating leases was million and million  respectively 
this amount excludes the straight line rent expense associated with our annual escalators and the amortization of the deferred gains recognized in connection with the sale leasebacks 
for the year ended december   our minimum annual lease payments for our capital and financing leases and operating leases was million and million  respectively 
this amount excludes the straight line rent expense associated with our annual escalators and the amortization of the deferred gains recognized in connection with the sale leasebacks 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of our capital and operating leases  including those covenants measuring facility operating income to gauge debt coverage 
hedging in the normal course of business  we use a variety of financial instruments to hedge interest rate risk 
we have entered into certain interest rate protection and swap agreements to effectively cap or convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis  as well as hedge anticipated future financing transactions 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated and combined balance sheet at fair value

we also have million of interest rate caps at a strike price of that mature in we expect to either renew these interest rate caps or enter into interest rate swaps upon maturity of these interest rate caps 
in addition  we have million of floating rate lease expense that is capped at pursuant to the terms of the lease 
impacts of inflation resident fees from the facilities we own or lease and management fees from facilities we manage for third parties are our primary sources of revenue 
these revenues are affected by the amount of monthly resident fee rates and facility occupancy rates 
the rates charged are highly dependent on local market conditions and the competitive environment in which our facilities operate 
substantially all of our independent  assisted living  and retirement centers ccrcs residency agreements allow for adjustments in the monthly fee payable thereunder not less frequently than every or months thereby enabling us to seek increases in monthly fees due to inflation  increased levels of care or other factors 
any pricing increase would be subject to market and competitive conditions and could result in a decrease in occupancy in the facilities 
we believe  however  that our ability to periodically adjust the monthly fee serves to reduce the adverse affect of inflation 
in addition  employee compensation expense is a principal cost element of facility operations and is also dependent upon local market conditions 
there can be no assurance that resident fees will increase or that costs will not increase due to inflation or other causes 
at december   approximately  million of our indebtedness and debt underlying a single lease bore interest at floating rates 
we have mitigated  million of our exposure to floating rates by using million of interest rate swaps and million of interest rate caps under our debt lease arrangements 
inflation  and its impact on floating interest rates  could affect the amount of interest payments due on such debt 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate  or different estimates that could have been selected  could have a material impact on our combined results of operations or financial condition 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect significant estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and assumptions at entrance fee facilities our ten entrance fee facilities provide housing and healthcare services through entrance fee agreements with residents 
under certain of these agreements  residents pay an entrance fee upon entering into the contract and are contractually guaranteed certain limited lifecare benefits in the form of healthcare discounts 
the recognition of entrance fee income requires the use of various actuarial estimates 
we recognize this revenue by recording the nonrefundable portion of the residents 
table of contents entrance fees as deferred entrance fee income and amortizing it into revenue using the straight line method over the estimated remaining life expectancy of each resident or couple 
we periodically assess the reasonableness of these mortality tables and other actuarial assumptions  and measurement of future service obligations 
self insurance liability accruals we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
although we maintain general liability and professional liability insurance policies for our owned  leased and managed facilities under a master insurance program  our current policy provides for deductibles of million for each and every claim 
as a result  we are effectively self insured for most claims 
in addition  we maintain a self insured workers compensation program with excess loss coverage above million per individual claim and a self insured employee medical program with excess loss coverage above million to million per individual claim 
we are self insured for amounts below these excess loss coverage amounts 
we review the adequacy of our accruals related to these liabilities on an ongoing basis  using historical claims  actuarial valuations  third party administrator estimates  consultants  advice from legal counsel and industry data  and adjust accruals periodically 
estimated costs related to these self insurance programs are accrued based on known claims and projected claims incurred but not yet reported 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts that are expected to be realized 
as of december  and  we have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
when we determine that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made and reflected in either income or as an adjustment to goodwill 
this determination will be made by considering various factors  including our expected future results  that in our judgment will make it more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
lease accounting we determine whether to account for our leases as either operating or capital leases depending on the underlying terms 
as of december   we operated facilities under long term leases with operating  capital and financing lease obligations 
the determination of this classification is complex and in certain situations requires a significant level of judgment 
our classification criteria is based on estimates regarding the fair value of the leased facilities  minimum lease payments  effective cost of funds  the economic life of the facility and certain other terms in the lease agreements as stated in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
facilities under operating lea ses are accounted for in our statement of operations as lease expenses for actual rent paid plus or minus straight line adjustments for fixed or estimated minimum lease escalators and amortization of deferred gains 
for facilities under capital lease and lease financing obligation arrangements  a liability is established on our balance sheet and a corresponding long term asset is recorded 
lease payments are allocated between principal and interest on the remaining base lease obligations and the lease asset is depreciated over the shorter of its useful life or the term of the lease 
in addition  we amortize leasehold improvements purchased during the term of the lease over the shorter of their economic life or the lease term 
sale leaseback transactions are recorded as lease financing obligations when the transactions include a form of continuing involvement  such as purchase options 
one of our leases provides for various additional lease payments based on changes in the interest rates on the debt underlying the lease 
all of our leases contain fixed or formula based rent escalators 

table of contents to the extent that the escalator increases are tied to a fixed index or rate  lease payments are accounted for on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
in addition  we recognize all rent free or rent holiday periods in operating leases on a straight line basis over the lease term  including the rent holiday period 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  to represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million  and million as of december  and  respectively 
the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed on an ongoing basis  using historical payment trends  write off experience  analyses of receivable portfolios by payor source and aging of receivables  as well as a review of specific accounts  and adjustments are made to the allowance as necessary 
changes in legislation are not expected to have a material impact on collections  however  changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations 
approximately of our resident and healthcare revenues for the year ended december  were derived from services covered by various third party payor programs  including medicare and medicaid 
billings for services under third party payor programs are recorded net of estimated retroactive adjustments  if any  under reimbursement programs 
retroactive adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in future periods or as final settlements are determined 
we accrue contractual or cost related adjustments from medicare or medicaid when assessed without regard to when the assessment is paid or withheld  even if we have not agreed to or are appealing the assessment 
subsequent positive or negative adjustments to these accrued amounts are recorded in net revenues when known 
long lived assets  goodwill  and purchase accounting as of december   and  our long lived assets were comprised primarily of  million   million and million  respectively  of property  plant and equipment and leasehold interests 
in accounting for our long lived assets  other than goodwill  we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in connection with our formation transactions  for financial reporting purposes we recorded the non controlling stockholders interest at fair value 
acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and the purchase prices are allocated to acquired assets and liabilities based on their estimated fair values 
goodwill associated with the arc merger and our formation transactions was allocated to the carrying value of each facility and included in our application of the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
as of december  and  we had million and million of goodwill  respectively 
the determination and measurement of an impairment loss under these accounting standards requires the significant use of judgment and estimates 
the determination of fair value of these assets utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and cost levels  assumed capitalization and discount rates based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors  all of which involve the use of significant judgment and estimation 
future events may indicate differences from management s current judgments and estimates  which could  in turn  result in impairment 
future events that may result in impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which would impact discount rates  differences in projecte d occupancy rates and changes in the cost structure of existing communities 
hedging we periodically enter into certain interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or to hedge anticipated future financings 
amounts paid or received under these agreements are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense when such amounts are 
table of contents incurred or earned 
for effective cash flow hedges  settlement amounts paid or received in connection with settled or unwound interest rate swap agreements are deferred and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income 
for effective fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivative will be offset against the corresponding change in fair value of the hedged asset or liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be recognized in earnings 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded at fair value through earnings 
on october   we elected to discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the previously designated swap instruments 
consequently  the net gain accumulated in other comprehensive income at that date of approximately million related to the previously designated swap instruments is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying hedged debt 
in the future  if the underlying hedged debt is extinguished or refinanced  the remaining unamortized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income will be recognized in net income 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  in connection with initial grants of restricted stock effective august  which were converted into shares of our restricted stock on september  in connection with our formation transaction 
this statement requires measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock compensation based on the grant date fair value of the employee stock awards 
incremental compensation costs arising from subsequent modifications of awards after the grant date must be recognized when incurred 
certain of our employee stock awards vest only upon the achievement of performance targets 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of compensation cost only when achievement of performance conditions is considered probable 
consequently  our determination of the amount of stock compensation expense requires a significant level of judgment in estimating the probability of achievement of these performance targets 
additionally  we must make estimates regarding employee forfeitures in determining compensation expense 
subsequent changes in actual experience are monitored and estimates are updated as information is available 
recently issued accounting pronouncements eitf issue no

non gaap financial measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable gaap measure 
in this report  we define and use the non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda  cash from facility operations and facility operating income  as set forth below

management s use of adjusted ebitda we use adjusted ebitda to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful in identifying trends in our day to day performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on our day to day operations 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
adjusted ebitda provides us with a measure of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  straight line rent expense income  taxation and interest expense associated with our capital structure 
this metric measures our financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda is one of the metrics used by senior management and the board of directors to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis 
adjusted ebitda is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance of and v alue companies in our industry 
limitations of adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate adjusted ebitda  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income loss  include

depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our facilities  which affects the services we provide to our residents and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures 
an investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position 
we use non gaap financial measures to supplement our gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda is not an alternative to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to gaap net income loss  along with our consolidated and combined financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the adjusted ebitda measure  as presented in this report  may diff er from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

recurring capital expenditures 

table of contents recurring capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from cash from facility operations 
amounts excluded from recurring capital expenditures consist primarily of unusual or non recurring capital items and facility purchases and or major renovations that are funded using financing proceeds and or proceeds from the sale of facilities that are held for sale 
management s use of cash from facility operations we use cash from facility operations to assess our overall liquidity 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
this metric measures our liquidity based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cash from facility operations is one of the metrics used by our senior management and board of directors i to review our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities and long term leases  ii our ability to pay dividends to stockholders  iii our ability to make regular recurring capital expenditures to maintain and improve our facilities on a period to period basis  iv for planning purposes  including preparation of our annual budget and v in setting various covenants in our credit agreements 
these agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between and per unit bed per year 
historically  we have spent in excess of these per unit bed amounts  however  there is no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit bed amounts in the future 
if we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts  we would be in default of the applicable debt or lease agreement which could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding indebtedness and lease arrangements 
limitations of cash from facility operations cash from facility operations has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of cash flow from operations 
cash from facility operations does not represent cash available for dividends or discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
material limitations in making the adjustment to our cash flow from operations to calculate cash from facility operations  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap operating cash flows  include

spacer

the cash portion of interest expense  income tax benefit provision and non recurring charges related to gain loss on sale of facilities and extinguishment of debt activities generally represent charges gains  which may significantly affect our financial results  and

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
depreciation and amortization  though not directly affecting our current cash position  represent the wear and tear and or reduction in value of our facilities  which affects the services we provide to our residents and may be indicative of future needs for capital expenditures 
we believe cash from facility operations is useful to investors because it assists their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness  including our credit facilities and capital and financing leases  our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and our ability to make regular recurring capital expenditures to maintain and improve our facilities 
cash from facility operations is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cash from facility operations as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of cash from facility operations to gaap net cash provided by used in operating activities  along with our consolidated and combined financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in 
table of contents addition  because cash from facility operations is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the cash from facility operations measure  as presented in this report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
the calculation of cash from facility operations includes combination expenses and acquisition transition costs of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  year end december  includes cash bonuses in connection with a restricted stock grant

management s use of facility operating income we use facility operating income to assess our facility operating performance 
we believe this non gaap measure  as we have defined it  is helpful in identifying trends in our day to day facility performance because the items excluded have little or no significance on our day to day facility operations 
this measure provides an assessment of revenue generation and expense management and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals as well as to achieve optimal facility financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 

table of contents facility operating income provides us with a measure of facility financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  lease expense  taxation and interest expense associated with our capital structure 
this metric measures our facility financial performance based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
facility operating income is one of the metrics used by our senior management and board of directors to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis 
facility operating income is also used by research analysts and investors to evaluat e the performance of and value companies in our industry by investors  lenders and lessors 
in addition  facility operating income is a common measure used in the industry to value the acquisition or sales price of facilities and is used as a measure of the returns expected to be generated by a facility 
a number of our debt and lease agreements contain covenants measuring facility operating income to gauge debt or lease coverages 
the debt or lease coverage covenants are generally calculated as facility net operating income defined as total operating revenue less operating expenses  all as determined on an accrual basis in accordance with gaap 
for purposes of the coverage calculation  the lender or lessor will further require a pro forma adjustment to facility operating income to include a management fee generally of operating revenue and an annual capital reserve generally per unit bed 
as of december   we are in compliance with the financial covenants of all of our debt and lease agreements 
an in vestor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position  particularly on a facility by facility basis 
limitations of facility operating income facility operating income has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of earnings 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our earnings to calculate facility operating income  and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net income loss  include

an investor or potential investor may find this item important in evaluating our performance  results of operations and financial position on a facility by facility basis 
we use non gaap financial measures to supplement our gaap results in order to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
facility operating income is not an alternative to net income  income from operations or cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on facility operating income as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure
