patents  trademarks and other intellectual property the company believes that the success of its business depends more on the technical competence  creativity and marketing abilities of its employees than on any individual patent  trademark or copyright

in the aggregate  patents and trademarks are of considerable importance to the manufacture and marketing of many of gardner denver s products

environmental matters the company is subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage  handling  emission  disposal and discharge of materials into the environment 
the company believes that its existing environmental control procedures are adequate and it has no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area 
gardner denver has an environmental policy that confirms its commitment to a clean environment and to compliance with environmental laws 
gardner denver has an active environmental management program aimed at compliance with existing environmental regulations and developing methods to eliminate or significantly reduce the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws  which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  gardner denver was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense

item a 
risk factors we have exposure to economic downturns and operate in cyclical markets 
as a supplier of capital equipment to a variety of industries  we are adversely affected by general economic downturns 
demand for compressor and vacuum products is dependent upon capital spending by manufacturing and process industries 
many of our customers  particularly industrial customers  will delay capital projects  including non critical maintenance and upgrades  during economic downturns 
demand for some of our fluid transfer products is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs and oil and natural gas prices 
the energy market  in particular  is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for these commodities is depressed  the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
the markets for our products have historically experienced downturns in demand 
future downturns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
large or rapid increases in the costs of raw materials or substantial decreases in their availability and our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our primary raw materials are cast iron  aluminum and steel 
although we have some long term contracts with key suppliers and are seeking to enter into additional long term contracts  we do not have long term contracts with most of our suppliers 
consequently  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of raw materials 
we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings and other select engineered components 
from time to time in recent years  we have experienced a disruption to our supply deliveries and may experience further supply disruptions 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers and  therefore  our operating results 
we face robust competition in the markets we serve  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we actively compete with many companies producing the same or similar products 
depending on the particular product  we experience competition based on a number of factors  including quality  performance  price and availability 
we compete against many companies  including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets 
in particular  it is possible that our european and asian based competitors could seek to establish a greater presence in the united states market 
if we cannot compete successfully  our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses and fully realize the related anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements 
we have completed acquisitions since becoming an independent company in  with the three largest transactions occurring since january our continued success depends in part on our ability to effectively integrate acquired businesses into our operations 
we face significant challenges in consolidating functions and integrating procedures  personnel  product lines  and operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process can be complex and time consuming  may be disruptive to our existing and acquired businesses  and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  those businesses 
even if we can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into our operations  there is no assurance that anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements will be realized within the expected time frame  or at all 
our ability to realize anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors  including the following our ability to effectively eliminate redundant administrative overhead and rationalize manufacturing capacity is difficult to predict 
accordingly  the actual amount and timing of the resulting cost savings are inherently difficult to predict 
we may incur significant cash integration costs in achieving cost savings  and any cost savings or other synergies from acquisitions may be offset by such integration costs 
the cost savings and other synergies realized from acquisitions may be offset by increases in other expenses  by operating losses  or by problems unrelated to any specific acquisition 
our success depends on our executive officers and other key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  particularly our chairman  president and chief executive officer  ross j 
centanni  could have an adverse impact 
none of our executive officers has an employment agreement 
however  we have a common stock ownership requirement and provide certain benefits for our executive officers  including change in control agreements  which provide incentives for them to make a long term commitment to our company 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we may not be able to continue to make the acquisitions necessary for us to realize our growth strategy 
one of our growth strategies is to increase our sales and expand our markets through acquisitions 
we expect to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  our acquired companies may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our business 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states 
we have manufacturing facilities in germany  the united kingdom  italy  sweden  china  finland  brazil and canada 
we anticipate that we may continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
non us operations and us export sales could be adversely affected as a result of nationalization of private enterprises  political or economic instability in certain countries  differences in foreign laws  including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights  changes in the legal and regulatory policies of foreign jurisdictions  credit risks  currency fluctuations  exchange controls  changes in tariff restrictions  royalty and tax increases  export and import restrictions and restrictive regulations of foreign governments  potential problems obtaining supply of raw materials  shipping products during times of crisis or war  and other factors inherent in foreign operations 
the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims  which could harm our business 
customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property  equipment or the environment 
in addition  our products are integral to the production process for some end users and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects 
we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size 
however  we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred 
we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable 
we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
under such laws and regulations  we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions and or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and regulations 
we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are  or have been  used for industrial purposes 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws 
an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs which are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters 
if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations  we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with regulatory requirements relating to environmental matters  and many environmental laws impose joint and several liability for remediation for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination  or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos and silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources  and typically we are one of approximately or more named defendants 
in our experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility 
we believe that the pending lawsuits will not  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  could cause a different outcome 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility 
we have debt of approximately million at december   and our indebtedness could have an adverse future effect on our business 
for example we may have a limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes  a portion of our cash flow may be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other purposes  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  the various covenants contained in our senior credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes  and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to some of our competitors  and borrowings under the senior credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates 
if we remain in compliance with the covenants set forth in the documents governing our indebtedness  we and or our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness 
if we or any of our subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness  the related risks that we now face may intensify 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality provisions  contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  from time to time we may receive notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be costly and time consuming  and can divert management s attention and other resources 
depending on the resolution of such claims  we may be barred from using a specific technology or other right  may be required to redesign or re engineer a product  or may become liable for significant damages 
our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages or other labor difficulties 
as of january  we have approximately  full time employees 
a significant number of our employees  including a large portion of the employees outside of the united states  are represented by works councils and labor unions 
although we do not anticipate future work stoppages by our union employees  there can be no assurance that work stoppages will not occur 
although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages  we cannot be assured that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements  that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor or that a breakdown in such negotiations will not result in the disruption of our operations 
the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and or decreased operating results 
our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income are dependent upon assumptions used in calculating such amounts and actual results of investment activity 
pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and expense or income are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts and actual results of investment activity 
these assumptions include discount rate  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates 
while we believe that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or future changes in assumptions may affect our obligations  future expense and funding requirements 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
as of december   goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or of our total assets 
goodwill is generated in an acquisition when the cost of such acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
goodwill and certain other identifiable intangible assets are subject to impairment analyses at least annually 
we could be required to recognize reductions in our net income caused by the impairment of goodwill and other intangibles  which  if significant  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations

management s discussion and analysis the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview and description of business the company believes it is one of the leading designers  manufacturers and marketers of engineered stationary air compressors  liquid ring pumps and blowers for various industrial and transportation applications and of pumps used in the petroleum and industrial markets and other fluid transfer equipment serving chemical  petroleum and food industries 
since becoming an independent company in  gardner denver has completed acquisitions  growing its revenues from approximately million in to approximately billion in of the acquisitions  the three largest  namely thomas  nash elmo and syltone  were completed since january  on january   the company acquired syltone  previously a publicly traded company listed on the london stock exchange 
for the twelve months ended september   syltone generated revenues in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united kingdom of million

nash elmo is primarily split between two businesses  liquid ring pumps and side channel blowers 
both businesses products are complementary to the compressor and vacuum products segment s product portfolio 
nash elmo  previously headquartered in trumbull  connecticut  has primary manufacturing facilities located in bad neustadt and nuremberg  germany  zibo  china  and campinas  brazil 
nash elmo s largest markets are in europe  asia and north america 
on july   the company acquired thomas  previously a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange 
thomas  previously headquartered in louisville  kentucky  was a leading supplier of pumps  compressors and blowers to original equipment manufacturer oem applications such as medical equipment  gasoline vapor and refrigerant recovery  automotive and transportation applications  printing  packaging  and laboratory equipment 
thomas designed  manufactured  marketed  sold and serviced these products through worldwide operations 
for the year ended december   thomas revenues and operating income were million and million  respectively 
operating income for this period included million from thomas interest in the genlyte thomas group llc  a joint venture formed with the genlyte group incorporated in  and a million one time gain on the sale of this joint venture in july gardner denver has five operating divisions compressor  blower  engineered products  thomas products and fluid transfer 
these divisions comprise two reportable segments compressor and vacuum products and fluid transfer products 
the compressor  blower  engineered products and thomas products divisions are aggregated into one reportable segment compressor and vacuum products since the long term financial performance of these businesses is affected by similar economic conditions  coupled with the similar nature of their products  manufacturing processes and other business characteristics 
in the first quarter of  the company made certain organizational changes that resulted in a realignment of its reportable segments 
the operations of the company s line of specialty bronze and high alloy pumps for the general industrial and marine markets acquired in july as part of thomas and the operations of its line of self sealing couplings acquired in january as part of syltone were transferred from the compressor and vacuum products segment to the fluid transfer products segment 
accordingly  the results of these two operations have been included in the fluid transfer products segment results 
results for the years ended december  and have been restated to reflect this realignment 
in addition  operating results of todo have been included in the fluid transfer products segment from the date of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  the company reorganized the composition of three of the operating divisions within the compressor and vacuum products segment and renamed its liquid ring pump division as the engineered products division to better reflect the nature and diversity of products offered by this division following the reorganization 
in the compressor and vacuum products segment  the company designs  manufactures  markets and services the following products and related aftermarket parts for industrial and commercial applications rotary screw  reciprocating  linear  diaphragm sliding vane and centrifugal compressors  positive displacement  centrifugal and side channel blowers  and liquid ring pumps and engineered systems 
stationary air compressors are used in manufacturing  process applications and materials handling  and to power air tools and equipment 
blowers are used primarily in pneumatic conveying  wastewater aeration  numerous applications in industrial manufacturing and engineered vacuum systems

higher shipment volume  especially from the petroleum related fluid transfer products such as drilling and well stimulation pumps  increased revenues by approximately million 
in addition  revenues increased approximately as a result of price increases and due to favorable foreign currency translation 
international revenues were of total revenues in  down slightly from in revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased to  million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to acquisitions completed in and organic growth  including increased shipment volume and price increases 
favorable currency translation also increased revenues 
fluid transfer products segment revenues increased to million in compared to million in this improvement in revenues was primarily driven by organic growth  including increased shipment volume in most product lines  but in particular drilling and well stimulation pumps 
price increases accounted for an additional of the revenue growth  while acquisitions and foreign currency translation increased revenues by and  respectively 
costs and expenses cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues improved to in from in this improvement was attributable to cost reduction initiatives and leveraging fixed and semi fixed costs over higher production volume 
favorable sales mix also contributed to the year over year improvement as included a higher percentage of drilling and replacement pump parts shipments compared to these products have cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization percentages below the company s average 
cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization in was negatively impacted by approximately million of non recurring costs attributable to inventory step up adjustments relating to recording the inventory of thomas and bottarini at fair value on the acquisition dates 
decreases in manufacturing productivity related to product line relocations associated with acquisition integration projects in and material and other cost increases partially offset these improvements 
depreciation and amortization increased million to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to the incremental effect of acquisitions completed in in addition  the year over year increase reflects a million net charge to depreciation and amortization  recorded in the second quarter of  as a result of the finalization of the fair value of the thomas tangible and amortizable intangible assets  of which million was associated with the six month period ended december  selling and administrative expenses increased million or  to million in  compared to million in the majority of the increase was due to the incremental effect of acquisitions  which contributed approximately million of additional selling and administrative expenses  and million of incremental stock based compensation expense associated with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r effective january  increases in selling and administrative expenses were partially offset by cost reductions realized through integration activities  net of inflationary factors such as salary increases 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to for the twelve month period of from in  due to increased leverage of these expenses over additional volume and the completion of various integration activities and cost reduction initiatives

contributions from cost reductions  favorable sales mix and price increases accounted for the majority of the improvement 
these positive factors were partly offset by increased material costs and compensation related expenses 
the operating margin in was also reduced by approximately million of non recurring costs for inventory step up adjustments relating to recording the inventory of thomas and bottarini at fair value on the acquisition dates 
the fluid transfer products segment generated operating earnings of million and operating margin of in  compared to million and  respectively  in see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating earnings to consolidated income before income taxes 
this improvement was primarily due to increased revenue volume  the positive impact of increased leverage of the segment s fixed and semi fixed costs over additional production volume and price increases 
improved productivity  benefits from capital investments  favorable sales mix associated with a higher proportion of drilling pump and replacement pump parts shipments  and acquisitions also contributed to the improvement 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to this increase was primarily due to additional funds borrowed to finance the acquisition of thomas and higher average interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate  including the amortization of debt issuance costs  was during  compared to during the higher weighted average interest rate in was primarily attributable to increases in market rates on floating rate debt and the greater relative weight of the interest rate on the million senior subordinated notes as floating rate debt with lower interest rates was retired in see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these increases were partially offset by debt reduction of approximately million during other income  net  in included approximately million of interest income earned on the investment of financing proceeds  prior to their use to complete the thomas acquisition  and proceeds from litigation related settlements of million that did not recur in other income  net  is excluded from segment operating earnings because such transactions occur infrequently and are generally not controlled by operating management at the segment level 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in compared to million in  as a result of incremental income before income taxes and a higher effective income tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate increased to in  compared to in the higher tax rate is principally due to incremental income before income taxes generated by the company s operations in higher tax rate jurisdictions the united states and germany in  and incremental tax expense incurred on repatriated earnings 
consolidated net income for totaled million  which represents an increase of million  or  compared to consolidated net income of million in diluted earnings per share were in  which represents an increase compared to diluted earnings per share of in the results for include incremental net income of approximately million from the acquisitions of thomas  bottarini and todo 
the increase in diluted earnings per share was partly offset by higher average shares outstanding as a result of impact of the issuance of million shares of the company s common stock during may adjusted for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend that was completed on june  
year ended december   compared with year ended december  revenues revenues increased million to  million in  compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisitions of thomas  nash elmo and bottarini  which contributed approximately million of additional revenues and organic growth million  or 
increased volume of shipments  especially from petroleum related fluid transfer products such as drilling and well stimulation pumps  and price increases also contributed to the growth in revenues 
these increases were partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates  mainly due to the strengthening of the u 
s dollar during against the british pound and the euro 
revenues outside the united states  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to in  compared to in  primarily due to acquisitions and volume increases in europe and china 
revenues for the compressor and vacuum products segment increased million to million in compared to million in of this increase  million was attributable to acquisitions completed in and and the balance was attributable to organic growth  consisting of increased volume of compressor and blower shipments in the us  europe and china  and price increases  partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
fluid transfer products segment revenues increased million to million in  compared to million in this improvement was driven by increased shipments in all product lines  but in particular  drilling and well stimulation pumps and water jetting systems 
price increases and the effect of acquisitions also contributed to the year over year sales growth 
costs and expenses cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to of sales in this reduction was primarily attributable to the increased fixed and semi fixed cost leverage over a higher revenue base  and favorable sales mix 
additionally  cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues for acquired businesses was less than that of the company s previously existing businesses 
these positive factors were partially offset by higher material costs due to surcharges stemming from increases in scrap iron and other metal prices  and some supply chain inefficiencies that affected material availability 
in addition  cost of sales excluding depreciation and amortization for and was negatively affected by the inclusion of million and million  respectively  of inventory step up adjustments relating to recording the inventory of acquired businesses at fair value on the acquisition dates 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million  compared to million in  primarily due to the thomas and nash elmo acquisitions 
selling and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the majority of the increase was due to the acquisitions of thomas  nash elmo and bottarini  which contributed approximately million of additional selling and administrative expenses compared to higher compensation and fringe benefit costs also contributed to this increase 
as a percentage of revenues  selling and administrative expenses decreased to for the twelve month period of from in  due to the leverage of incremental revenue volume and the completion of various integration activities and cost reductions 
the compressor and vacuum products segment generated operating earnings of million and operating margin of in  compared to million and  respectively  in see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating earnings to consolidated income before taxes 
contributions from acquisitions net of cost reductions realized with operating margins higher than the company s previously existing businesses  volume increases  cost reductions and favorable sales mix accounted for the majority of the increase 
these positive factors were partially offset by increased material costs and compensation related expenses 
the fluid transfer products segment generated operating earnings of million and operating margin of in  compared to million and  respectively  in see note segment information in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of segment operating earnings to consolidated income before taxes 
this improvement was primarily attributable to volume increases  the positive effect of increased cost leverage over a higher revenue base and price increases 
capital investments to improve productivity and production efficiency combined with favorable product mix associated with a higher proportion of drilling pump shipments in as compared to  also contributed to the improvement in operating margin 
interest expense increased million to million in  compared to this increase was primarily due to additional funds borrowed to finance the acquisition of thomas and higher average interest rates 
the weighted average interest rate  including the amortization of debt issuance costs  was during  compared to during the higher weighted average interest rate in was primarily attributable to increases in market rates on floating rate debt and the issuance of million of senior subordinated notes in the second quarter of see note debt in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income  net increased million in to million  compared to the previous year 
this change was primarily due to litigation related settlements  a gain from the sale of a distribution facility and interest income earned on the investment of financing proceeds prior to their use to complete the acquisition of thomas 
the litigation related settlements and gain from the sale of a distribution facility were excluded from segment operating earnings because such transactions occur infrequently and are generally not controlled by management at the segment level 
the provision for income taxes increased by million to million in  compared to million in  as a result of incremental income before taxes and a slightly higher effective tax rate 
the company s effective tax rate was in  compared to in the higher tax rate is principally due to a nonrecurring favorable tax audit settlement in of million 
the tax rate in also was slightly higher as a result of accruing an additional million of tax related to the repatriation of certain non us earnings in at a reduced income tax rate pursuant to the american jobs creation act of this slight increase was largely offset by deriving a higher proportion of earnings in from lower taxed non us jurisdictions 
consolidated net income for totaled million  which represents an increase of million  or  compared to net income of million in diluted earnings per share were in  which represents a increase compared to diluted earnings per share of earned in the results for include incremental net income of approximately million from the acquisition of nash elmo  compared to the previous year  and million from the acquisition of thomas 
the increase in net income was partially offset by higher average shares outstanding for the twelve month period of  as compared to  as a result of the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock in may outlook in general  demand for compressor and vacuum products tends to correlate to the rate of manufacturing capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial equipment production because air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process 
over longer time periods  demand also follows economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gross domestic product around the world 
generally  demand for the company s products used in industrial applications lags economic cycle changes by approximately six months 
at present  manufacturing capacity utilization rates in the us  as published by the federal reserve board  remain above  which has historically indicated a good demand environment for industrial equipment such as compressors and blowers 
however  the company expects the industrial production rate of growth to slow in the us throughout the company continues to see growing industrial demand in europe and on going strength in asia 
as a result of these growth expectations and increasing demand anticipated in the us for environmental applications  the company believes that the industrial portion of its business will continue to grow in  although at a slower rate than realized in the company continues to have good visibility of the demand for its oil and natural gas well drilling and servicing products 
based on input from its customers  the company anticipates demand for well servicing pumps to grow in  compared to  and the company has invested in key machine tools in order to increase its production capacities accordingly 
at this point  the company is uncertain about the level of drilling pump demand in the second half of  but has the flexibility to reduce the levels of previously outsourced production if demand were to decline 
in  orders for compressor and vacuum products were  million  compared to  million in the incremental impact on orders from acquisitions completed during for this segment was approximately million for the year ended december  excluding the impact of acquisitions  the increase in orders compared to the prior year was primarily due to an overall improvement in industrial demand  pricing and incremental market share gains in europe and china 
order backlog for the compressor and vacuum products segment was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the increase is primarily attributable to the increase in orders and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
demand for petroleum related fluid transfer products has historically corresponded to market conditions and expectations for oil and natural gas prices 
orders for fluid transfer products were million in  compared to million in compared to the prior year  the increase in orders is primarily attributable to continued strong demand for drilling pumps  well stimulation pumps and petroleum pump parts  as a result of the continued high prices for oil and natural gas  price increases and the incremental impact of todo and thomas acquisitions 
order backlog for the fluid transfer products segment was million at december   compared to million at december   representing a increase 
future increases in demand for these products will likely be dependent upon rig counts and oil and natural gas prices  which the company cannot predict 
the company has launched several initiatives aimed at integrating recent acquisitions and streamlining manufacturing operations 
the company has substantially completed its plan to transfer the manufacturing of standard liquid ring pumps from a production facility in nuremberg  germany to other existing company facilities in china and brazil 
construction of the facility expansion in china was finished during the third quarter of and shipments of products previously manufactured in germany have commenced from both facilities 
in addition  management has rationalized the company s european blower product lines and manufacturing facilities 
through this project  the company s separate blower manufacturing operations located in schopfheim  germany were merged  and the company relocated the mobile blower product line from schopfheim to a gardner denver facility in the united kingdom  where other european mobile equipment is currently manufactured 
as part of this project  management has also rationalized the side channel blower product lines acquired as part of the nash elmo and thomas acquisitions and centralized production of standard side channel blowers in the company s manufacturing facility in bad neustadt  germany 
liquidity and capital resources operating working capital during  operating working capital defined as accounts receivable plus inventories  less accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased million to million 
this increase was driven by higher accounts receivable resulting from the revenue growth during compared to  higher inventory levels required to support the planned increase in production volume and shipments in the first half of and the effect of foreign currency exchange rates 
these increases were partially offset by the realization of benefits from the implementation of lean manufacturing initiatives in resulting in an increase in inventory turns to in from in and a reduction in days sales outstanding from in to in net working capital defined as total current assets less total current liabilities was million at december   compared with million at december  cash flows during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  a increase compared to million generated in this increase was primarily due to higher net income and depreciation and amortization expense  partially offset by volume related increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in financing activities of million in primarily reflected the use of available cash and cash generated from operating activities to repay long term borrowings 
during  the company used approximately million in excess cash from its non us subsidiaries to reduce debt 
as of december   the company s debt to total capital was  compared to on december  capital expenditures and commitments capital projects designed to increase operating efficiency and flexibility  expand production capacity and bring new products to market resulted in capital expenditures of approximately million in  compared to million in the higher spending in was primarily due to spending related to cost reduction initiatives  manufacturing capacity improvements and incremental spending at acquired businesses 
unspent amounts on approved capital projects at december  were approximately million 
in  capital spending is expected to be approximately to million 
capital expenditures related to environmental projects have not been significant in the past and are not expected to be significant in the foreseeable future 
in october  the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of the company s common stock to be used for general corporate purposes  of which  shares remain available for repurchase under this program as of december  the company has also established a stock repurchase program for its executive officers to provide a means for them to sell the company s common stock and obtain sufficient funds to meet income tax obligations which arise from the exercise or vesting of incentive stock options  restricted stock or performance shares 
the company s board of directors has authorized up to  shares for repurchase under this program  and of this amount   shares remain available for repurchase as of december  as of december   a total of  shares have been repurchased at a cost of approximately million under both repurchase programs 
liquidity the company s primary source of debt funding is its amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides the company with access to senior secured credit facilities  including a term loan in the original principal amount of million  and a million revolving line of credit 
the term loan has a final maturity of july   and the principal balance outstanding at december  was million 
the term loan requires quarterly principal payments aggregating approximately million  million  million  and million in through  respectively 
the revolving line of credit also matures on july  loans under this facility may be denominated in us dollars or several foreign currencies and may be borrowed by the company or two of its foreign subsidiaries as outlined in the credit agreement 
on december   the revolving line of credit had an outstanding principal balance of million  leaving million available for letters of credit or for future use  subject to the terms of the revolving line of credit 
the interest rates applicable to loans under the credit agreement are variable and will be  at the company s option  the prime rate plus an applicable margin or libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin percentages are adjustable quarterly  based upon financial ratio guidelines defined in the credit agreement 
the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge some of its exposure to variability in future libor based interest payments on variable rate debt see note off balance sheet risk  concentrations of credit risk and fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s obligations under the credit agreement are guaranteed by the company s existing and future domestic subsidiaries  and are secured by a pledge of certain subsidiaries capital stock 
the company is subject to customary covenants regarding certain earnings  liquidity and capital ratios 
the company also raised debt funding by issuing million of senior subordinated notes the notes in the notes have a fixed annual interest rate of and are guaranteed by certain of the company s domestic subsidiaries 
at any time prior to may   the company may redeem all or part of the notes issued under the indenture at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the notes redeemed plus an applicable premium in the range of to of the principal amount  and accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
in addition  at any time prior to may   the company may  on one or more occasions  redeem up to of the aggregate principal amount of the notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any  with the net cash proceeds of one or more equity offerings  subject to certain conditions 
on or after may   the company may redeem all or a part of the notes at varying redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
upon a change of control  as defined in the indenture  the company is required to offer to purchase all of the notes then outstanding for cash at of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidated damages  if any 
the indenture contains events of default and affirmative  negative and financial covenants customary for such financings  including  among other things  limits on incurring additional debt and restricted payments 
during  the company used approximately million in excess cash from its non us subsidiaries and cash generated from operating activities to pay down debt 
overall  the company reduced its borrowings by approximately million in debt to total capital was as of december   compared to as of december  management currently expects the company s future cash flows to be sufficient to fund its scheduled debt service and provide required resources for working capital and capital investments for at least the next twelve months 
the company was in compliance with all covenants related to its credit facilities during contractual obligations and commitments the following table and accompanying disclosures summarize the company s significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods dollars in millions payments due by period less than more than contractual cash obligations total year years years years debt estimated interest payments capital leases operating leases purchase obligations total estimated interest payments for long term debt were calculated as follows for fixed rate debt and term debt  interest was calculated based on applicable rates and payment dates  for variable rate debt and or non term debt  interest rates and payment dates were estimated based on management s determination of the most likely scenarios for each relevant debt instrument 
management expects to settle such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and or short term borrowings 
purchase obligations consist primarily of agreements to purchase inventory or services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated as of december  for this reason  these numbers will not provide a complete and reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the total pension and other postretirement benefit liability recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  was million and represents the funded status of the company s defined benefit plans at the end of the total pension and other postretirement benefit liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line items accrued liabilities  postretirement benefits other than pensions and other liabilities 
this amount is impacted by  among other items  plan funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets 
because this liability does not represent expected liquidity needs  the company did not include this amount in the contractual obligations table above 
the company funds its us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the company is committed to making the required minimum contributions and expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its us qualified pension plans during furthermore  the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its us postretirement health care benefit plans during future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets  benefit payment experience and changes  if any  to current funding requirements 
therefore  no amounts were included as contractual cash obligations in the above table 
the company generally expects to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
the company s non us pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its non us qualified pension plans during no amounts have been included in the contractual cash obligations table due to the same reasons noted above 
disclosure of amounts in the contractual cash obligations table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
however  in order to inform the reader about expected benefit payments for these plans over the next several years  the company anticipates annual benefit payments to be in the range of approximately million to million for the us plans and million to million for the non us plans in and to remain at or near these annual levels for the next several years 
during the third quarter of  the company implemented certain revisions to the gardner denver  inc pension plan  which became effective november  see note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
net deferred income tax liabilities were million as of december  this amount is not included in the contractual cash obligations table because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
as a result  scheduling deferred income tax liabilities as payments due by period could be misleading  because this scheduling would not relate to liquidity needs 
in the normal course of business  the company or its subsidiaries may sometimes be required to provide surety bonds  standby letters of credit or similar instruments to guarantee its performance of contractual or legal obligations 
as of december   the company had million in such instruments outstanding and had pledged million of cash to the issuing financial institutions as collateral for such instruments 
contingencies the company is a party to various legal proceedings  lawsuits and administrative actions  which are of an ordinary or routine nature 
in addition  due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and other primary defendants  among other things  the company has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of silicosis personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which the company bears responsibility 
predecessors to the company sometimes manufactured  distributed and or sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silicosis litigation lawsuits the products 
however  neither the company nor its predecessors ever mined  manufactured  mixed  produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand  the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits 
moreover  the asbestos containing components of the products were enclosed within the subject products 
the company has entered into a series of cost sharing agreements with multiple insurance companies to secure coverage for asbestos and silicosis lawsuits 
the company also believes some of the potential liabilities regarding these lawsuits are covered by indemnity agreements with other parties 
the company s uninsured settlement payments for past asbestos and silicosis lawsuits have been immaterial 
the company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silicosis lawsuits will not  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  based on the company s anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters  the limited potential asbestos exposure from the components described above  the company s experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which the company otherwise bears responsibility  various potential defenses available to the company with respect to such matters  and the company s prior disposition of comparable matters 
however  due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  could cause a different outcome  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under federal superfund or similar state laws  which impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  the company was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense 
the company is also addressing three on site cleanups for which it is the primary responsible party 
two of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and the third is in the implementation stage 
the company is also participating in a voluntary cleanup program with other potentially responsible parties on a fourth site which is in the assessment stage 
based on currently available information  the company does not anticipate that any of these sites will result in material additional costs beyond those already accrued on its balance sheet 
the company has an accrued liability on its balance sheet to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for its remaining financial obligations for these matters 
based upon consideration of currently available information  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations  or cleanup costs relating to the sites discussed above

will have on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosure requirements 
critical accounting policies management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
management believes that the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements related to these areas are based on their best judgments and estimates  although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions 
inventories and warranty reserves inventories  which consist of materials  labor and manufacturing overhead  are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
as of december   million of the company s inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out fifo basis with the remaining million accounted for on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the company establishes reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
the company s products typically carry a one year warranty 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
goodwill and other intangibles intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  generally to years 
intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization  but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
this testing requires comparison of carrying values to fair values 
when appropriate  the carrying value of impaired assets is reduced to fair value 
the company estimates fair value using available information regarding expected future cash flows and a discount rate that is based upon the cost of capital specific to the company 
goodwill impairment is tested at the operating division level 
during the second quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment tests and determined that the carrying values of intangible assets not subject to amortization and goodwill were not impaired 
pension and other postretirement benefits gardner denver offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to employees 
the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
these assumptions include the discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations  future rate of compensation increases  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare trend rates 
the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  and were derived by examining the rates of high quality  fixed income securities whose cash flows or duration match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments under a plan 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized through net periodic benefit cost over future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost 
please refer to note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to gardner denver s benefit plans  including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations 
income taxes the calculation of gardner denver s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
as part of the company s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors us and international tax developments in order to evaluate the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments utilized in determining the income tax provision  and records adjustments as necessary 
contingencies contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of the potential loss 
the most significant contingencies impacting the company s financial statements are those related to product warranty  personal injury lawsuits  environmental remediation and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
for additional information on these matters  see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates  as well as european and other foreign currency exchange rates  and selectively uses derivative financial instruments  including forwards and swaps  to manage these risks 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the value of market risk sensitive derivatives and other financial instruments is subject to change as a result of movements in market rates and prices 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to evaluate these impacts 
as a result of recent acquisitions  a significant amount of the company s net income is earned in foreign currencies 
therefore  a strengthening in the us dollar across relevant foreign currencies  principally the euro  british pound and chinese yuan  would have a corresponding negative impact on the company s future earnings 
all derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
for each derivative instrument designated as a cash flow hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until recognized in earnings with the underlying hedged item 
for each derivative instrument designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative instrument and the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item are recognized immediately in earnings 
currency fluctuations on non us dollar borrowings that have been designated as hedges on the company s investment in a foreign subsidiary are included in other comprehensive income 
to effectively manage interest costs  the company utilizes interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments 
including the impact of interest rate swaps outstanding  the interest rates on approximately of the company s total borrowings were effectively fixed as of december  also as part of its hedging strategy  the company utilizes purchased option and forward exchange contracts to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions  cash flows and firm commitments 
these contracts for the sale or purchase of european and other currencies generally mature within one year 
notional transaction amounts and fair values for the company s outstanding derivatives  by risk category and instrument type  as of december  and  are summarized in note  off balance sheet risk  concentrations of credit risk and fair value of financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements
