table of contents viad sold certain undeveloped land for million in cash  resulting in a gain of million viad repurchased  shares of its common stock for million ges revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million  an increase of percent over segment operating income exhibitgroup revenues of million  a decrease of percent over revenues segment operating loss of million compared to segment operating income in of  travel and recreation services revenues of million  an increase of percent over revenues segment operating income of million  an increase of percent over segment operating income non gaap measure the following discussion includes a presentation of adjusted ebitda  which is utilized by management to measure the profit and performance of viad s operations and to facilitate period to period comparisons 
adjusted ebitda is defined by viad as net income before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations 
adjusted ebitda is considered a useful operating metric as potential variations arising from taxes  depreciation  debt service costs  impairment losses and recoveries  changes in accounting principles and the effects of discontinued operations are eliminated  thus resulting in an additional measure considered to be indicative of viad s ongoing operations 
adjusted ebitda is also used by management to assess viad s ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures and finance growth 
the presentation of adjusted ebitda is supplemental to results presented under gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies 
this non gaap measure should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  other measures of financial performance and liquidity reported in accordance with gaap 
management believes that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding viad s results of operations for trending  analyzing and benchmarking the performance and value of viad s business 
management uses adjusted ebitda primarily as a performance measure and believes that the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to this non gaap measure is net income 
although adjusted ebitda is used as a financial measure to assess the performance of the business  the use of adjusted ebitda is limited because it does not consider material costs  expenses and other items necessary to operate the business 
these items include debt service costs  non cash depreciation and amortization expense associated with long lived assets  expenses related to us federal  state  local and foreign income taxes  impairment losses or recoveries  and the effects of accounting changes and discontinued operations 
because adjusted ebitda does not consider the above items  a user of viad s financial information should consider net income as an important measure of financial performance because it provides a more complete measure of the company s performance 
a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income loss is as follows in thousands adjusted ebitda impairment losses  net interest expense income tax expense depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations  net of tax net income loss the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from compared to was primarily driven by favorable operating income at ges and the travel and recreation services businesses  as well as by higher interest income 
this was partially offset by unfavorable operating results at exhibitgroup 
the increase in adjusted ebitda of million from compared to was driven by favorable operating income at exhibitgroup as well as by higher interest income and favorable restructuring and corporate costs 

table of contents results of operations vs 
revenues for increased percent to million from million in the increase was a result of strong growth at ges and solid performance by the travel and recreation businesses 
income before income taxes and minority interests was million for compared to million for income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  up from million  or per diluted share  in during  viad recorded an intangible asset impairment loss of million million after tax related to the write off of the remaining book value of the trademark intangible asset at exhibitgroup 
viad recorded net impairment recoveries of million  after tax in related to insurance recoveries of million relating to assets that were damaged as a result of hurricane katrina partially offset by an impairment loss of  related to the reduction in value of a non core asset 
in  viad recorded impairment losses of   after tax related to assets that were damaged as a result of hurricane katrina 
the increase in income from continuing operations was largely due to tax benefits of million versus million in related to the favorable resolution of tax matters  an increase in net interest income  improved operating results and gains from the sale of corporate assets 
the increase in net impairment losses partially offset these favorable items 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  consisting of million million pre tax related to the expiration of product warranty liabilities associated with a previously sold manufacturing operation and million primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax and other matters related to previously sold operations 
net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  also relating to the favorable resolution of tax and other matters related to previously sold operations 
ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
the increase was primarily due to strong same show growth  an increase in exhibitor discretionary revenue and continued growth in the exhibition and event industry 
base same show growth  which is revenue growth generated from shows that occur in the same city and same quarter each year  was percent as compared to percent in segment operating income increased percent to million in from million in  primarily as a result of the revenue increase 
operating margins were percent in both years 
as compared to  ges s operating results reflect higher costs for performance based incentives  as ges was successful in achieving strong growth over  and for headcount that was added to drive the revenue growth and improved profitability in ges s shows throughout in addition  viad received million related to the final settlement of its ges business interruption insurance claim resulting from hurricane katrina  which was recorded in ges s operating income 
certain claims related to exhibitgroup remain pending with viad s insurance carriers and the amounts of recoveries related to exhibitgroup  if any  remain uncertain 
in general  the exhibition and event industry is experiencing signs of modest growth in terms of square footage and number of exhibitors 
management believes that further improvements in the economy and corporate earnings could lead to increased show spending 
the prospects for individual shows tend to be driven by the success of the industry related to those shows 
ges has a diversified revenue base and is generally insulated from industry specific trends 
material handling revenue  a key driver in the official services contractor business model  can be affected by the weight of exhibits and products that are brought onto the show floor 
in prior years  ges experienced pressure on material handling margins due to a trend toward lighter weight exhibits and fewer products 
while this trend does not appear to have reversed  ges has experienced a stabilization of material handling revenue relative to increases or decreases in the mix of material handling revenue could affect future operating margins 
management continues to emphasize cost containment and productivity improvements  as well as revenue growth through service enhancements  greater market penetration into exhibitor discretionary spending  and the introduction of new products and technology 
management will also continue its petroleum surcharge program and pursue other targeted price increases 
ges and exhibitgroup are subject to multiple collective bargaining agreements that affect labor costs  approximately one third of which expire each year 
although labor relations between the companies and labor are currently stable  disruptions during future contract negotiations could occur  with the possibility of an adverse impact on the operating results of ges and or exhibitgroup 
exhibitgroup 
revenue for exhibitgroup was million for  a decrease of percent from the amount of million 
segment operating loss for was million versus segment operating income of  in the decreases resulted primarily from the loss of revenue from certain clients who were not re signed and from existing client spending in that did not recur in exhibitgroup did not realize revenue growth from other clients that was sufficient to offset these 
table of contents negative factors 
operating results for include million in legal fees net of million in recoveries incurred to protect intellectual property rights in exhibitgroup s kiosk business 
exhibitgroup s operating results also reflected higher costs for performance based incentives as compared to exhibitgroup did not achieve its performance objectives in  but did in many large corporate clients continue to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than place orders for new construction 
the mix of construction revenue including kiosk construction in as compared to remained in the range of to percent of exhibitgroup s total revenue  well below the historical norms of to percent 
with the decline in overall revenue  the decline in exhibit construction revenue has led to excess production capacity at exhibitgroup s manufacturing locations 
the overall capacity utilization has declined from to management is currently evaluating exhibitgroup s sales and production processes  as well as the organizational and cost structure of the business 
visibility over future revenues continues to be poor and a sustained increase in customer marketing spending on new exhibit construction has not materialized to date 
in response to a challenging exhibit market  management is focused on repositioning exhibitgroup as a marketing services firm to capture a greater share of clients marketing budgets by delivering comprehensive  innovative  value added solutions that enable clients to generate a higher return on their face to face marketing investments 
management is also focused on improving the sales pipeline and win rate to drive profitable revenue growth  as well as cost control and productivity enhancements in order to improve profitability in future years 
management expects operating results to decline in as a result of costs associated with the initiatives to reposition exhibitgroup for future growth 
travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation services segment were million for  an increase of percent from million in segment operating income was million for  an increase of percent from million for operating margins increased to percent for from percent in as discussed below  results in this segment were favorably impacted by exchange rates during in addition  brewster saw growth in passenger volume at the banff gondola  an increase in occupancy at the mount royal hotel and increased revenue per passenger at its columbia icefield attraction 
additionally  glacier park saw strong occupancy at its inns and lodges and an increase in room revenue during during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of operating income generated in viad s travel and recreation services segment was derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation  and accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  and therefore  revenue and operating income in the travel and recreation services segment 
the operating results related to viad s canadian subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of and for and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s consolidated results of operations have been favorably impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations 
decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into us dollars 
glacier park operates the concession portion of its business under concession contracts with the us national park service the park service for glacier national park and with the canadian government for waterton lakes national park 
glacier park s year lease with the canadian government expires in  with glacier park having an option to renew for two additional terms of years each 
glacier park s original year concession contract with the park service that was to expire on december   was extended for two one year periods and now expires on december  the park service  in its sole discretion  may also extend glacier park s concession contract for up to one additional year 
when this contract ultimately expires  glacier park will either negotiate a new or longer term extended concession contract or cease its concession services to the park service 
if glacier park does negotiate a new or extended contract  possible terms would be for  or years  with years being the most likely 
if a new concessionaire is selected by the park service  glacier park s business would consist of the operations at waterton lakes national park and east glacier  montana 
in such a circumstance  glacier park would be entitled to an amount equal to its possessory interest  which generally means the value of the structures acquired or constructed  fixtures installed and improvements made to the concession property at glacier national park during the term of the concessions contract 
this value would be based on the reconstruction cost of a new unit of like kind  less physical depreciation  but not to exceed fair market value 
glacier park generated percent of travel and recreation services full year operating income 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense decreased  from to this decrease was primarily related to a reduction in travel related costs  certain insurance related costs and other administrative costs  partially offset by an increase in share based compensation expense and a decrease in interim services expense reimbursements from moneygram international  inc moneygram  a former subsidiary of viad that was spun off in 
table of contents gains on sale of corporate assets 
in january  viad sold a percent interest in its corporate aircraft to moneygram for million in cash resulting in no gain or loss in connection with the transaction 
in january  viad sold its remaining percent interest in the aircraft along with related equipment to moneygram for million  resulting in a gain of million 
also in january  viad sold certain undeveloped land in phoenix  arizona for million to an unrelated third party  resulting in a gain of million 
net interest income 
net interest income of million for increased from million for the increase was due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances and higher yields on those balances in as compared to income taxes 
the effective tax rate on income before income taxes and minority interests for was percent compared to percent for the relatively low effective tax rates compared to the statutory rate were primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of tax matters totaling of million and million in and  respectively 
vs 
revenues for increased percent to million from million in growth in ges s exhibitor discretionary revenue and continued improvement in the exhibition and event industry as well as increases in the travel and recreation services segment contributed to the increase 
income before income taxes and minority interests was million for compared with a loss before income taxes and minority interests of million for income from continuing operations for was million  or per diluted share  up from a loss of million  or per diluted share  in during  viad recorded asset impairment and related losses of   after tax related to damage caused by hurricane katrina to ges s new orleans facility 
in  the company recorded an impairment charge of million million after tax representing the entire carrying amount of exhibitgroup s goodwill and a charge of million million after tax representing a partial write down of the trademark intangible asset at exhibitgroup 
excluding these items  the increase in income from continuing operations was primarily driven by improved operating income at exhibitgroup  and to a lesser extent  an increase in net interest income combined with favorable restructuring costs and lower corporate activities costs 
in addition  viad recorded tax benefits of million in continuing operations in related to the favorable resolution of tax matters as compared to million in net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for net income for includes income from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share  primarily related to the favorable resolution of tax and other matters related to previously sold operations  compared to million in  or per diluted share 
ges 
revenues for ges were million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
the increase was primarily due to a percent increase in base same show growth over  which is revenue growth generated from shows that occur in the same city and same quarter each year 
this growth was attributed to continued improvement in the exhibition and event industry and to increased efforts of the products and services group  which provides discretionary services to exhibitors 
segment operating income increased slightly to million in from million in operating margins decreased to percent in from percent in as a result of the change in revenue mix from material handling revenue to exhibitor discretionary revenue 
exhibitors were using lighter weight exhibits and brought fewer products to the show floor  which put pressure on higher margin material handling revenue 
higher petroleum costs and the disruption of exhibition activity caused by hurricane katrina also had a negative impact on ges s operating margins 
during the third quarter of  viad recorded asset impairment and related losses of   after tax related to damage caused by hurricane katrina to ges s new orleans facility 
ges s new orleans operation has historically generated less than five percent of its annual revenue and at the time of the hurricane  ges had already realized a majority of the revenue budgeted for new orleans 
exhibitgroup 
revenue for exhibitgroup was million for  an increase of percent from the amount of million 
segment operating income for was  versus a segment operating loss of million in operating results for include million in legal fees net of million in recoveries incurred to protect intellectual property rights in exhibitgroup s kiosk business 
despite these costs  there was significant improvement in operating results due to management s continued focus on initiatives to increase sales and gross margins and to drive cost savings  process and quality service improvements 
exhibitgroup s operating results also benefited somewhat from a slight improvement in the mix of construction revenue  particularly in the third and fourth quarters 
while the mix of construction revenue including kiosk construction improved slightly in as compared to  it remained in the range of to percent of exhibitgroup s total revenue 
this range was well below the historical norms of to percent  as many exhibitors continued to reuse or refurbish existing exhibits rather than place orders for new construction 

table of contents travel and recreation services 
revenues of the travel and recreation services segment were million for  an increase of percent from million in mostly related to favorable exchange rates as discussed below 
the improvement was also due to increased occupancy at brewster s mount royal hotel and at glacier park s inns and lodges  as well as a percent increase in passenger volume at the banff gondola 
segment operating income was million for  compared with million for operating margins decreased to percent for from percent in due to higher fuel costs and certain maintenance expenses 
during  approximately percent of revenue and percent of operating income generated in viad s travel and recreation services segment was derived through its canadian operations 
these operations are largely dependent on foreign customer visitation  and accordingly  increases in the value of the canadian dollar compared to other currencies could adversely affect customer volumes  and therefore  revenue and operating income in the travel and recreation services segment 
the operating results related to viad s canadian subsidiaries were translated into us dollars at weighted average exchange rates of and for and  respectively 
accordingly  viad s consolidated results of operations have been favorably impacted by the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar as it relates to the translation of its canadian operations 
decreases in the exchange rates may adversely impact overall expected profitability and historical period to period comparisons when operating results are translated into us dollars 
corporate activities 
corporate activities expense decreased million from to this was primarily related to a reduction in certain insurance related costs of approximately  and an increase in interim services expense reimbursements from moneygram of approximately  a majority of the services provided in the interim services agreement were terminated in september net interest income expense 
net interest income of million for improved from net interest expense of million for the increase was due to higher average cash and cash equivalent balances and higher yields on those balances in as compared to income taxes 
the effective tax rate on income before income taxes and minority interests for was percent compared to a tax benefit of percent for the relatively low effective tax rate in compared to the statutory rate was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of tax matters of million 
the rate in was impacted by the goodwill and intangible asset write offs during the year and the favorable resolution of tax matters of million 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million as of december  as compared to million as of december   with the increase primarily due to cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the company s sale of percent of its corporate aircraft and the sale of certain undeveloped land as discussed below  partially offset by share repurchases 
management believes that viad s existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund operations and capital commitments for at least the next months

viad authorized a stock repurchase program in for the purpose of replacing common stock issued upon exercise of stock options and in connection with other stock compensation plans  with the intended effect of reducing dilution caused by the issuance of these shares of viad common stock 
this program was on hold for most of and all of  and in february and again in july  viad announced its intent  under an authorization by its board of directors  to repurchase up to one million shares for a total of two million shares of the company s common stock from time to time at prevailing prices in the open market 
as of december   viad had repurchased  common shares for million under these authorizations

represents remaining amount to be redeemed per viad s notice of redemption to the holders of the company s mandatorily redeemable preferred stock undertaken in connection with the completion of the moneygram spin off 
viad and certain of its subsidiaries are plaintiffs or defendants to various actions  proceedings and pending claims  some of which involve  or may involve  compensatory  punitive or other damages 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties and it is possible that some of the legal actions  proceedings or claims could be decided against viad 
although the amount of liability as of december  with respect to these matters is not ascertainable  viad believes that any resulting liability  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on viad s business  financial position or results of operations 

table of contents viad is subject to various us federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing the prevention of pollution and the protection of the environment in the jurisdictions in which viad has or had operations 
if the company has failed to comply with these environmental laws and regulations  civil and criminal penalties could be imposed and viad could become subject to regulatory enforcement actions in the form of injunctions and cease and desist orders 
as is the case with many companies  viad also faces exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters relating to its past operations 
although it is a party to certain environmental disputes  viad believes that any resulting liabilities  after taking into consideration amounts already provided for  including insurance coverage  will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements viad does not have any off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated special purpose or other entities that would affect the company s financial position  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
furthermore  viad does not have any relationships with special purpose or other entities that provide off balance sheet financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support  or engage in leasing or other services that expose the company to liability or risks of loss that are not reflected in viad s consolidated financial statements 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
the sec has defined a company s most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations  and that require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on these criteria  viad has identified and discussed with its audit committee the following critical accounting policies and estimates pertaining to viad  and the methodology and disclosures related to those estimates goodwill and other intangible assets viad performs annual impairment testing of its goodwill based on the estimated fair value of its reporting units  which is estimated based on discounted expected future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital rate 
additionally  an assumed terminal value is used to project future cash flows beyond base years 
the estimates and assumptions regarding expected cash flows  terminal values and the discount rate require considerable judgment and are based on historical experience  financial forecasts and industry trends and conditions 
viad s policy is to test goodwill for impairment annually as of october of each year 
as of december   viad had recorded goodwill of million and million related to ges and travel and recreation services  respectively 
during  viad recorded an impairment loss of million representing the entire carrying amount of goodwill at exhibitgroup 
viad also performs annual impairment testing of its intangible assets not subject to amortization 
in  viad recorded an aggregate impairment charge of million related to the trademark intangible at exhibitgroup 
the fair value of the trademark intangible was estimated based on expected future cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  viad re examined the value of that trademark and recorded an additional impairment charge of million to write off the remaining book value 
viad s policy is to test intangible assets not subject to amortization for impairment annually as of october of each year 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further disclosures regarding viad s goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes viad is required to estimate and record provisions for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
accordingly  the company must estimate its actual current income tax liability  and assess temporary differences arising from the treatment of items for tax purposes as compared to the treatment for accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in viad s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
as of december  and  viad had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in  viad recorded a valuation allowance of  related to certain state deferred tax assets at exhibitgroup 
with respect to all other deferred tax assets  management believes that recovery from future taxable income is more likely than not 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
viad is subject to regular and recurring audits by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which the company conducts or had previously conducted significant operations 
accordingly  the company has recorded accrued liabilities associated with specific us federal  state  local and foreign tax audit exposures expected to arise in connection with such audits 
as of december  and  viad had million and million  respectively  accrued for these exposures  which includes accrued interest 
if amounts accrued are less than amounts ultimately assessed by the taxing authorities  viad would record additional income tax expense in the period in which the assessment is determined 
to the extent that the company has favorable 
table of contents settlements  or determines that reserves are no longer needed  due to a lapse of the applicable statute of limitations or other reasons  such liabilities would be reversed as a reduction of income tax expense net of federal tax effects  if applicable  or in some cases through discontinued operations  in the period such determination is made 
viad s policy is to retain amounts accrued for tax audit exposures until final resolution or settlement with the appropriate taxing authority 
based on tax audits in process and other factors  management currently estimates that tax issues of approximately million exclusive of any federal tax effects could potentially be resolved or settled during resulting in a decrease of accrued income taxes 
to the extent these tax resolutions or settlements occur  they would result in cash payments and or the reversal of accrued income taxes which may include amounts related to previously discontinued operations 
during the years ended december   and  viad recorded tax benefits related to the favorable resolution of tax matters in continuing operations of million  million and million  respectively 
these settlements resulted in a decrease to income tax expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tax matters related to discontinued operations 
in addition to the specific tax audit exposures for which viad has recorded loss liabilities  there are other known tax audit exposures which have been identified in recent and ongoing tax audits for which viad has not recorded contingent liabilities as potential losses related to those specific issues are not deemed probable 
to the extent that the facts and circumstances related to these known tax audit exposures indicate that an unfavorable outcome is probable and can be reasonably estimated  viad would record accrued liabilities and additional income tax expense in the period for which that assessment is determined 
for the specific issues for which viad can reasonably estimate a range of possible loss  the aggregate decrease to net income could range from  to million 
in the first quarter of  viad will adopt the provisions of fin related to accounting for uncertain tax positions 
the adoption of fin could have a material effect on the amounts accrued related to viad s tax audit exposures 
see impact of recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion 
insurance liabilities viad is self insured up to certain limits for workers compensation  automobile  product and general liability and property loss claims 
the aggregate amount of insurance liabilities related to viad s continuing operations was million as of december  of this total  million related to workers compensation liabilities and the remaining million related to general auto liability claims 
viad has also retained and provided for certain insurance liabilities in conjunction with previously sold businesses totaling million as of december   primarily related to workers compensation liabilities 
provisions for losses for claims incurred  including estimated claims incurred but not yet reported  are made based on viad s historical experience  claims frequency and other factors 
a change in the assumptions used could result in an adjustment to recorded liabilities 
viad has purchased insurance for amounts in excess of the self insured levels  which generally range from  to  on a per claim basis 
viad does not maintain a self insured retention pool fund as claims are paid from current cash resources at the time of settlement 
viad s net cash payments in connection with these insurance liabilities were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
pension and other postretirement benefits viad s pension plans use traditional defined benefit formulas based on years of service and final average compensation 
funding policies provide that payments to defined benefit pension trusts shall be at least equal to the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
the company presently anticipates contributing  to its funded pension plans and  to its unfunded pension plans in viad and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit postretirement plans that provide medical and life insurance for certain eligible employees  retirees and dependents 
the related postretirement benefit liabilities are recognized over the period that services are provided by employees
