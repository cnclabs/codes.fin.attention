the company intends to grow responsibly  focusing on the markets with the best potential for sales and return on investment 
a total of new restaurants were opened in current plans call for a total of to new company and franchise restaurant units to open in the primary focus will be on core operations of wendy s in north america  with the majority of units being standard sites 
another element of the company s strategic plan is the evaluation of potential acquisitions of franchised restaurants  the sale of company stores to franchisees and vertical integration opportunities that could add to the company s long term earnings growth 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as of december  and january  as that term is described by the sec 
revenue recognition wendy s has a significant number of company operated restaurants at which revenue is recognized as customers pay for products at the time of sale 
franchise revenues consist of royalties  rents  gains from the sales of properties to franchisees  and various franchise fees 
royalty revenues are normally collected within two months after a period ends 
the timing of revenue recognition for both retail sales and franchise revenues does not involve significant contingencies and judgments other than providing adequate reserves against collections of franchise related revenues 
the application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on 
table of contents the results of operations of the company 
the earnings reporting process is covered by the company s system of internal controls  and generally does not require significant management estimates and judgments 
however  estimates and judgments are inherent in the calculations of royalty and other franchise related revenue collections  legal obligations  pension and other postretirement benefits  income taxes  insurance liabilities  various other commitments and contingencies  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of goodwill  other intangibles and other long lived assets and the estimation of the useful lives of fixed assets and other long lived assets 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from these assumptions 
it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using different assumptions 
the company collects royalties  and in some cases rent  from franchisees 
the company provides for estimated losses for revenues that are not likely to be collected 
although the company generally enjoys a good relationship with franchisees  and collection rates are currently very high  if average sales or the financial health of franchisees were to deteriorate  the company might have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
the company is self insured for most domestic workers compensation  health care claims  general liability and automotive liability losses 
the company records its insurance liabilities based on historical and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
outside actuaries are used to assist in estimating casualty insurance obligations 
since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in recording insurance liabilities  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to these liabilities 
workers compensation insurance can particularly involve significant time before the ultimate resolution of claims 
wendy s had accrued million and million at year end and  respectively  for domestic workers compensation liabilities  domestic general liability  domestic automotive liability and other property liabilities 
in canada  workers compensation benefits are part of a government sponsored plan and although the company and its employees make contributions to that plan  management is not involved in determining these amounts 
pension and other retirement benefits  including all relevant assumptions required by generally accepted accounting principles  are evaluated each year with the oversight of the company s retirement committee 
due to the technical nature of retirement accounting  outside actuaries are used to provide assistance in calculating the estimated future obligations 
market interest rates are reviewed to establish pension plan discount rates and expected returns on plan assets are based on the mix of investments and expected market returns 
since there are many estimates and assumptions involved in retirement benefits  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and assumptions could result in adjustments to pension expenses and obligations 
if the company were to change its discount rate by  this would change annual pension costs by million 
if the company were to change its long term return on assets rate by  this would change annual pension costs by million 
in the normal course of business  the company must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
the company records income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
when considered necessary  the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when the company determines that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 

table of contents due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
the company uses an estimate of its annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method in amounts adequate to amortize costs over the following estimated useful lives buildings and leasehold improvements and property under capital leases  the lesser of the useful life of the asset up to years or the lease term  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended  restaurant equipment  up to years  and other equipment  up to years 
the company estimates useful lives on buildings and equipment based on historical data and industry trends 
the company capitalizes certain internally developed software costs which are amortized over a period of up to years 
the company monitors its capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
intangibles separate from goodwill are amortized on a straight line basis over periods of up to years 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives  or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
long lived assets are grouped into operating markets and tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates that an impairment may exist 
the company tests for impairment using the cash flows of the operating markets 
a significant deterioration in the cash flows of an operating market or other circumstances may trigger impairment testing 
if an impairment is indicated  the fair value of the fixed assets is estimated using the discounted cash flows or third party appraisals of the operating market 
the interest rate used in preparing discounted cash flows is management s estimate of the weighted average cost of capital 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or in interim periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit  as measured by discounted cash flows and market multiples based on earnings  to the carrying value to determine if there is an indication that a potential impairment may exist 
one of the most significant assumptions is the projection of future sales 
the company reviews its assumptions each time goodwill is tested for impairment and makes appropriate adjustments  if any  based on facts and circumstances available at that time 
in the fourth quarter of  the company tested goodwill for impairment and determined that no impairment was required 
prior to january   the company used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation as defined in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  because stock options granted prior to january  had no intrinsic value at date of grant  compensation expense related to stock options was recognized using the black scholes method only when stock option awards were modified after the grant date 
during the fourth quarter of  the company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding options  excluding those held by outside directors of the company 
prior to january   compensation expense recognized related to restricted shares was measured based on the market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
the company generally satisfies share based exercises and vesting through the issuance of authorized but previously unissued shares of company stock 
restricted shares are generally net settled with new company shares withheld  and not issued  to meet the employee s minimum statutory withholding tax requirements 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  which requires share based compensation cost to be recognized based on the grant date estimated fair value of each award  net of estimated cancellations  over the employee s requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
the company elected to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  which requires compensation expense to be recorded for all unvested share based awards beginning in the first quarter of adoption 
accordingly  the prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing stock options 
also  because the value used to measure compensation expense for restricted shares is the same for apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
r and because substantially all of the company s stock option grants were fully vested prior to january   the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on the company s operating income  pretax income or net income 
the adoption did require the company to classify million in tax benefits as a financing activity versus an operating activity in the consolidated statements of cash flows

 accounting for income taxes 
an uncertain tax position will be recognized if it is determined that it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation is to be reported as a separate adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  upon adoption  management estimates that there will not be a significant adjustment to retained earnings for a change in reserves for uncertain tax positions and is in the process of finalizing its analysis

these factors include competition within the quick service restaurant industry  which remains extremely intense  both domestically and internationally  with many competitors pursuing heavy price discounting  changes in economic conditions  changes in consumer perceptions of food safety  harsh weather  particularly in the first and fourth quarters  changes in consumer tastes  labor and benefit costs  legal claims  risk inherent to international development including currency fluctuations  the continued ability of the company and its franchisees to obtain suitable locations and financing for new restaurant development  governmental initiatives such as minimum wage rates  taxes and possible franchise legislation  changes in applicable accounting rules  the ability of the company to successfully complete transactions designed to improve its return on investment  or other factors set forth in item a and exhibit hereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk inflation financial statements determined on a historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for the company 
inventories approximate current market prices  there is some ability to adjust prices and liabilities are repaid with dollars of reduced purchasing power 
foreign exchange risk the company s exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations in the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
the impact of foreign exchange rates on the company s income statement is predominately related to canadian wendy s operations  since exposure outside of north america is limited to royalties paid by franchisees 
the exposure to canadian dollar exchange rates on the company s cash flows primarily includes imports paid for by canadian operations in us dollars and payments from the company s canadian operations to the company s us operations 
in aggregate  cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were in excess of million in after the spin off of thi  the company s exposure to canadian dollar foreign currency risk is not material 

table of contents the company seeks to manage its cash flows and balance sheet exposure to changes in the value of foreign currencies 
the company may use derivative products to reduce the risk of a significant negative impact on its us dollar cash flows or income 
the company does not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
the company has a policy forbidding trading or speculating in foreign currency and does not hedge foreign currency translation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company defers unrealized gains and losses arising from foreign currency derivatives until the impact of the related transactions occur 
fair values are determined from quoted market prices 
at the level of annual operating income generated from canada  if the canadian currency rate changes us  or compared to the average exchange rate  for an entire year  the annual impact on the company s diluted eps would be less than one half cent per share 
at current royalty levels outside of north america  if all foreign currencies moved during each royalty collection period in the same direction  at the same time  the annual impact on the company s diluted eps would be approximately one half cent per share 
the company has not hedged its exposure to currency fluctuations related to royalty collections outside north america because it does not believe the risk is material 
interest rate risk the company s debt is denominated in us dollars  at fixed interest rates 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk impacting its net borrowing costs 
the company may seek to manage its exposure to interest rate risk and to lower its net borrowing costs by managing the mix of fixed and floating rate instruments based on capital markets and business conditions 
to manage interest rate risk  the company entered into an interest rate swap in  effectively converting some of its fixed interest rate debt to variable interest rates 
by entering into the interest rate swap  the company agreed  at specified intervals  to receive interest at a fixed rate of and pay interest based on the floating libor bba interest rate  both of which are computed based on the agreed upon notional principal amount of million 
the company does not enter into speculative swaps or other financial contracts 
the interest rate swap matured in december and met specific conditions of sfas no 
to be considered a highly effective fair value hedge of a portion of the company s long term debt 
accordingly  gains and losses arising from the swap were completely offset against gains or losses of the underlying debt obligation 
commodity risk the company purchases certain products in the normal course of business  which are affected by commodity prices 
therefore  the company is exposed to some price volatility related to weather and various other market conditions outside the company s control 
however  the company employs various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally these techniques can include setting fixed prices with suppliers generally for one year  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future sometimes referred to as buying forward  and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over a period of time 
the company has not used financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of the contract pricing utilized 
while price volatility can occur  which would impact profit margins  there are generally alternative suppliers available and  if the pricing problem is prolonged  the company has some ability to increase selling prices to offset a rise in commodity price increases 
in instances such as reported cases of mad cow disease and illnesses from the e 
coli bacteria  it is possible the company may be exposed to risks other than price risk 
the recent reported cases of mad cow disease and illnesses from the e 
coli bacteria in north america  however  did not significantly impact the company s sales or earnings 
there can be no assurance  however  that a future case of mad cow disease or illness from the e 
coli bacteria or another food borne illness would not have a significant impact on the company s sales and earnings 

table of contents concentration of credit risk the company has cash balances in various domestic bank accounts above the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic guarantee limits 
the company subscribes to a bank rating system and only utilizes high grade banks for accounts that might exceed these limits 
at year end  the amount in domestic bank accounts above fdic limits was approximately million
