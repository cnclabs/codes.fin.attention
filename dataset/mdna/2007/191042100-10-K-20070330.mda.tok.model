strong demand for cobra s new band models and expanded placement at wal mart were mainly responsible for the increase in detection 
these increases were offset in part by an approximate percent decline in two way radio net sales in north america  which reflected slightly lower unit sales and a percent drop in average selling prices due to overall higher household penetration as these markets mature  and lower citizens band radio net sales resulting from a decline in purchases by radio shack as well as the negative effect of high fuel prices on the discretionary income of professional drivers

accordingly  the results of operations discussed below are those of that one business segment 
the million increase in net sales in from million to million  resulted primarily from higher sales in detection and citizens band radios 
detection sales benefited from the addition in of two major new radar customers  radio shack and sears  as well as strong sales to two of the company s largest existing detection customers  best buy and wal mart

ten meter radios  a new product line in  also contributed to the overall sales increase in offsetting these increases in part were lower unit sales of two way radios  mainly because of a major customer s declining two way business  and handheld gps models as the company was discontinuing this line at this time 
gross margin decreased to percent from percent in primarily due to lower net pricing on older mobile navigation models because of the introduction of the nav one and nav one with significant new features 
also contributing to the gross margin decline were lower margins on the sale of radar detectors to several customers which require minimal program dollars for advertising and sales promotion activities  thus offsetting the lower margin with lower variable selling expenses

depreciation and amortization included million of product software amortization mainly for cobra brand mobile navigation products   of amortization for erp internal software and  of ppl amortization of intangibles and other assets that resulted from the allocation of the purchase price for ppl in accordance with sfas no 
impairment of product software resulted from the impact of lower selling prices on first generation cobra brand handheld gps and mobile navigation products and an impairment adjustment for the obsolescence of intellectual property because the company acquired new intellectual property to support future mobile navigation products 
the decrease in receivables reflected the terms of sale for certain customers that had greater sales in than in deferred compensation increased because in there was a lump sum payment in settlement of the deferred compensation obligation to the estate of a former president and chief executive officer 
inventories increased because of an increase in ppl s inventory since the date of acquisition mainly because of products that had been delayed due to vendor issues and increases in detection inventory in anticipation of strong demand in the first quarter of and in mobile navigation inventory  mostly older models that will be sold early in intangible assets increased primarily because of costs incurred for product software development in connection with the company s development of cobra brand mobile navigation products 
the company expects that costs for mobile navigation product software development will continue in and beyond 
additionally  the amortization of these product software assets is also expected to increase in future years 
other assets increased because of higher expenditures on packaging and outside design for new products to be introduced in  particularly mobile navigation and detection products  as well as prepaid loan fees incurred in connection with the credit agreement that was restated and amended in late to provide funding for the acquisition of ppl 
working capital requirements are seasonal  with demand for working capital being higher later in the year as customers begin purchasing for the holiday selling season 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and from borrowings under its credit agreement will be sufficient in to fund its working capital needs

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions 
the accounting policies and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer estimated based on the average shipping time for all such customers  when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described below 
sales returns reserve 
the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reduction in accounts receivable and increases in inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales 
table of contents and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 
warranty reserve 
the company generally provides a one year consumer warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales and the unit standard cost of each model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in its estimate  as historical experience indicates that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical return rates and how the returned product will be disposed of  either by liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 
liquidation reserve 
the company maintains a liquidation reserve representing the write down of returned product from our customers to its net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for partial credit against similar  new models  this decision depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to the vendor  taking into consideration the liquidation prices expected to be received and the amount of vendor credit 
the amount of the reserve is determined by comparing the cost of each unit returned to the estimated amount to be realized upon each unit s disposition  either from returning the unit to the vendor for credit towards the cost of new  similar product or liquidating the unit 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 
net realizable value reserve 
the company maintains a net realizable value reserve to write down below cost  as necessary  certain inventory not previously sold to customers where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included in the reserve and the estimated net realizable value of such model ie  the per unit price that it is estimated can be received in the marketplace if the model was sold 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
advertising and sales promotion accrual 
the advertising and sales promotion accrual reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  generally agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary quarter to quarter depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of its planned program sales  negotiate changes to the term of the existing programs or add new ones  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in such customer s programs 
periodic adjustments may also be necessary for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation 
obligations under the deferred compensation plans most of which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the discount rate for and was percent 
the compensation increase assumptions are 
table of contents based on historical experience and anticipated future performance 
the company maintains life insurance policies for certain current and former executives to provide funding for future obligations 
as of december   the cash surrender value of the insurance policies in force for the company s president and chief executive officer was software related to products to be sold 
the company purchases and or incurs costs in connection with the development of software to be used in products that the company intends to sell  mainly mobile navigation products 
such costs are capitalized and deferred as intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
such costs consist of expenditures incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established either from a working model of the product developed  a detail design  or the purchase of computer software that has an alternative future use 
such costs which consist principally of coding and related costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the estimated product life cycle 
software related intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date for possible impairment as required by paragraph of sfas no 
 and  accordingly  if such review indicates that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or if impairment indicators exist 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of estimated fair value of ppl to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
the fair values used in the sfas evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections 
these cash flow projections are based on a number of assumptions  including risk adjusted discount rates  future sales volumes  price levels and rates of increase in operating expenses 
management believes that the assumptions made in projecting future cash flows for the evaluations described above are reasonable 
however  if future actual results do not meet expectations  the company may be required to record an impairment charge  the amount of which could be material to its results of operations 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires impairment testing whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist for an amortizable intangible asset  the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the asset are compared to the carrying value of the asset 
if the projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets  no impairment charge is recorded 
if the projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the intangible asset to its fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange risks and interest rates are inherent to the company s operations 
changes to these factors could cause fluctuations in the company s net earnings  cash flows and the fair values of financial instruments subject to market risks 
the company identifies theses risks and mitigates the financial impact with hedging and interest rate swaps 
debt incurred under a revolving loan agreement with a balance of million as of december  is priced at an interest rate that floats with the market 
therefore  this debt is not significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market 
also  the company has million of debt as of december  with a fixed rate of interest 
accordingly  fair value of this fixed rate debt can be significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market
