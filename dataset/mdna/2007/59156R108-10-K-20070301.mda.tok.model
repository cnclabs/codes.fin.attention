the management s discussion and analysis which follows isolates  in order to be meaningful  the results of the travelers acquisition in the period over period comparison as the travelers acquisition was not included in the results of the company until july  the travelers amounts which have been isolated represent the results of the travelers legal entities which have been acquired 
these amounts represent the impact of the travelers acquisition  however  as business currently transacted through the acquired travelers legal entities is transitioned to legal entities already owned by the company  some of which has already occurred  the identification of the travelers legal entity business will not necessarily be indicative of the impact of the travelers acquisition on the results of the company 
as a part of the travelers acquisition  management realigned certain products and services within several of the company s segments to better conform to the way it manages and assesses its business 
accordingly  all prior period segment results have been adjusted to reflect such product reclassifications 
also in connection with the travelers acquisition  management has utilized its economic capital model to evaluate the deployment of capital based upon the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in the company s existing and newly acquired businesses and has adjusted such allocations based upon this model 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  excluding the acquisition of travelers  which contributed million during the first six months of to the year over year increase  net income available to common shareholders increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to the period 
income from discontinued operations consisted of net investment income and net investment gains related to real estate properties that the company had classified as available for sale or had sold and  for the years ended december  and  the operations and gain upon disposal from the sale of ssrm holdings  inc ssrm on january  and for the year ended december   the operations of pt sejahtera metlife indonesia which was sold on september  income from discontinued operations  net of income tax  increased by  million  or  to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the comparable period 
this increase is primarily due to a gain of billion  net of income tax  on the sale of the peter cooper village and stuyvesant town properties in manhattan  new york  as well as a gain of million  net of income tax  related to the sale of ssrm during the year ended december  this increase was partially offset by gains during the year ended december  including  million  net of income tax  on the sales of the one madison avenue and park avenue properties in manhattan  new york  as well as gains on the sales of ssrm and metlife indonesia of million and million  respectively  both net of income tax 
in addition  there was lower net investment income and net investment gains from discontinued operations related to other real estate properties sold or held for sale during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net investment losses increased by million  net of income tax  to a loss of million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the comparable period 
excluding the impact of the acquisition of travelers  which contributed a loss of million during the first six months of to the year over year increase  net investment losses increased by million 
the increase in net investment losses was due to a combination of losses from the mark to market on derivatives and foreign currency transaction losses during  
table of contents largely driven by increases in us interest rates and the weakening of the dollar against the major currencies the company hedges  notably the euro and pound sterling 
dividends on the holding company s series a and series b preferred shares preferred shares issued in connection with financing the acquisition of travelers increased by million  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period  as the preferred stock was issued in june the remainder of the increase of million in net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  compared to the period was primarily due to an increase in premiums  fees and other revenues attributable to continued business growth across all of the company s operating segments 
also contributing to the increase was higher net investment income primarily due to an overall increase in the asset base  an increase in fixed maturity security yields  improved results on real estate and real estate joint ventures  mortgage loans  and other limited partnership interests  as well as higher short term interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in net investment income from securities lending results  and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
favorable underwriting results for the year ended december  were partially offset by a decrease in net interest margins 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in expenses primarily due to higher interest expense on debt  increased general spending  higher compensation and commission costs and higher expenses related to growth initiatives and information technology projects  partially offset by a reduction in travelers integration expenses  principally corporate incentives 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the company reported  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  compared to  million in net income available to common shareholders and diluted earnings per common share of for the year ended december  the acquisition of travelers contributed million to net income available to common shareholders for the year ended december  excluding the impact of travelers  net income available to common shareholders increased by  million in the period 
the years ended december  and include the impact of certain transactions or events  the timing  nature and amount of which are generally unpredictable 
these transactions are described in each applicable segment s discussion below 
these items contributed a benefit of million  net of income tax  to the year ended december  and a benefit of million  net of income tax  to the comparable period 
excluding the impact of these items  net income available to common shareholders increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to the prior period 
in  the company sold its one madison avenue and park avenue properties in manhattan  new york  which  combined  resulted in a gain of  million  net of income tax 
in addition  during  the company completed the sales of ssrm and metlife indonesia and recognized gains of million and million  respectively  both net of income tax 
in  the company completed the sale of the sears tower property resulting in a gain of million  net of income tax 
accordingly  income from discontinued operations and  correspondingly  net income  increased by  million for the year ended december  compared to the period primarily as a result of the aforementioned sales 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in net investment losses of million  net of income tax  for the year ended december  as compared to the corresponding period in the acquisition of travelers contributed a loss of million  net of income tax  to this decrease 
excluding the impact of travelers  net investment gains losses decreased by million  net of income tax  in the period 
this decrease is primarily due to losses on fixed maturity security sales resulting from continued portfolio repositioning in the period 
significantly offsetting these reductions is an increase in gains from the mark to market on derivatives in the derivative gains resulted from changes in the value of the dollar versus major foreign currencies  including the euro and pound sterling  and changes in us interest rates during the year ended december  the increase in net income available to common shareholders during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is partially due to the decrease in net income available to common shareholders in the prior year of million  net of income tax  as a result of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in 
table of contents recorded in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain nontraditional long duration contracts and for separate accounts sop 
in addition  during the second half of the year ended december   the holding company paid million in dividends on the preferred shares issued in connection with financing the acquisition of travelers 
the remaining increase in net income available to common shareholders of million is primarily due to an increase in premiums  fees and other revenues primarily from continued sales growth across most of the company s business segments  as well as the positive impact of the us financial markets on policy fees 
policy fees from variable life and annuity and investment type products are typically calculated as a percentage of the average assets in policyholder accounts 
the value of these assets can fluctuate depending on equity performance 
in addition  continued strong investment spreads are largely due to higher than expected net investment income from corporate joint venture income and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
partially offsetting these increases is a rise in expenses primarily due to higher interest expense  integration costs  corporate incentive expenses  non deferrable volume related expenses  corporate support expenses and dac amortization 
acquisitions and dispositions on september   the company completed the sale of metlife indonesia to a third party  resulting in a gain upon disposal of million  net of income tax 
as a result of this sale  the company recognized income loss from discontinued operations of million and million  net of income tax  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company reclassified the operations of metlife indonesia into discontinued operations for all years presented 
on september   the company completed the acquisition of citistreet associates  a division of citistreet llc  which is primarily involved in the distribution of annuity products and retirement plans to the education  healthcare  and not for profit markets  for million  of which million was allocated to goodwill and million to other identifiable intangibles  specifically the value of customer relationships acquired  which has a weighted average amortization period of years 
citistreet associates was integrated with metlife resources  a focused distribution channel of metlife  which is dedicated to provide retirement plans and financial services to the same markets 
on july   the holding company completed the acquisition of the travelers insurance company  excluding certain assets  most significantly  primerica  from citigroup inc citigroup  and substantially all of citigroup s international insurance businesses collectively  travelers for billion 
the results of travelers operations were included in the company s financial statements beginning july  as a result of the acquisition  management of the company increased significantly the size and scale of the company s core insurance and annuity products and expanded the company s presence in both the retirement savings domestic and international markets 
the distribution agreements executed with citigroup as part of the acquisition provide the company with one of the broadest distribution networks in the industry 
the initial consideration paid by the holding company for the acquisition consisted of billion in cash and  shares of the holding company s common stock with a market value of billion to citigroup and million in other transaction costs 
additional consideration of million was paid by the holding company to citigroup in as a result of the finalization by both parties of their review of the june  financial statements and final resolution as to the interpretation of the provisions of the acquisition agreement 
in addition to cash on hand  the purchase price was financed through the issuance of common stock  debt securities  common equity units and preferred stock 
see liquidity and capital resources the holding company liquidity sources 
on january   the company completed the sale of ssrm to a third party for million in cash and stock 
as a result of the sale of ssrm  the company recognized income from discontinued operations of million  net of income tax  comprised of a realized gain of million  net of income tax  and an operating expense related to a lease abandonment of million  net of income tax 
under the terms of the sale agreement  metlife will have an opportunity to receive additional payments based on  among other things  certain revenue retention and growth measures 
the purchase price is also subject to reduction over five years  depending on retention of certain metlife related business 
also under the terms of such agreement  metlife had the opportunity to receive additional consideration for the retention of certain customers for a specific period in upon 
table of contents finalization of the computation  the company received payments of million  net of income tax  in the second quarter of and million  net of income tax  in the fourth quarter of due to the retention of these specific customer accounts 
in the fourth quarter of  the company eliminated million of a liability that was previously recorded with respect to the indemnities provided in connection with the sale of ssrm  resulting in a benefit to the company of million  net of income tax 
the company believes that future payments relating to these indemnities are not probable 
the company reported the operations of ssrm in discontinued operations 
additionally  the sale of ssrm resulted in the elimination of the company s asset management segment 
the remaining asset management business  which is insignificant  is reported in corporate other 
the company s discontinued operations for the year ended december  included expenses of million  net of income tax  related to the sale of ssrm 
industry trends the company s segments continue to be influenced by a variety of trends that affect the industry 
financial environment 
the level of long term interest rates and the shape of the yield curve can have a negative impact on the demand for and the profitability of spread based products such as fixed annuities  guaranteed interest contracts gics and universal life insurance 
a flat or inverted yield curve and low long term interest rates will be a concern until new money rates on corporate bonds are higher than overall life insurer investment portfolio yields 
equity market performance can also impact the profitability of life insurers  as product demand and fee revenue from variable annuities and fee revenue from pension products tied to separate account balances often reflect equity market performance 
steady economy 
a steady economy provides improving demand for group insurance and retirement savings type products 
group insurance premium growth  with respect to life and disability products  for example  is closely tied to employers total payroll growth 
additionally  the potential market for these products is expanded by new business creation 
bond portfolio credit losses continue close to low historical levels due to the steady economy 
demographics 
in the coming decade  a key driver shaping the actions of the life insurance industry will be the rising income protection  wealth accumulation and needs of the retiring baby boomers 
as a result of increasing longevity  retirees will need to accumulate sufficient savings to finance retirements that may span or more years 
helping the baby boomers to accumulate assets for retirement and subsequently to convert these assets into retirement income represents an opportunity for the life insurance industry 
life insurers are well positioned to address the baby boomers rapidly increasing need for savings tools and for income protection 
the company believes that  among life insurers  those with strong brands  high financial strength ratings and broad distribution  are best positioned to capitalize on the opportunity to offer income protection products to baby boomers 
moreover  the life insurance industry s products and the needs they are designed to address are complex 
the company believes that individuals approaching retirement age will need to seek information to plan for and manage their retirements and that  in the workplace  as employees take greater responsibility for their benefit options and retirement planning  they will need information about their possible individual needs 
one of the challenges for the life insurance industry will be the delivery of this information in a cost effective manner 
competitive pressures 
the life insurance industry remains highly competitive 
the product development and product life cycles have shortened in many product segments  leading to more intense competition with respect to product features 
larger companies have the ability to invest in brand equity  product development  technology and risk management  which are among the fundamentals for sustained profitable growth in the life insurance industry 
in addition  several of the industry s products can be quite homogeneous and subject to intense price competition 
sufficient scale  financial strength and financial flexibility are becoming prerequisites for sustainable growth in the life insurance industry 
larger market participants tend to have the capacity to invest in additional distribution capability and the information technology needed to offer the superior customer service demanded by an increasingly sophisticated industry client base 

table of contents regulatory changes 
the life insurance industry is regulated at the state level  with some products and services also subject to federal regulation 
as life insurers introduce new and often more complex products  regulators refine capital requirements and introduce new reserving standards for the life insurance industry 
regulations recently adopted or currently under review can potentially impact the reserve and capital requirements of the industry 
in addition  regulators have undertaken market and sales practices reviews of several markets or products  including equity indexed annuities  variable annuities and group products 
pension plans 
on august   president bush signed the pension protection act of ppa into law 
this act is considered to be the most sweeping pension legislation since the adoption of the employee retirement income security act of erisa on september  the provisions of the ppa may have a significant impact on demand for pension  retirement savings  and lifestyle protection products in both the institutional and retail markets 
this legislation  while not immediate  may have a positive impact on the life insurance and financial services industries in the future 
impact of hurricanes on august   hurricane katrina made landfall in the states of louisiana  mississippi and alabama  causing catastrophic damage to these coastal regions 
metlife s cumulative gross losses from hurricane katrina were million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily arising from the company s homeowners business 
during the years ended december  and  the company recognized total net losses  net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables and including reinstatement premiums and other reinsurance related premium adjustments related to the catastrophe as follows auto home institutional total company years ended december  years ended december  years ended december  in millions net ultimate losses at january  total net losses recognized net ultimate losses at december  on october   hurricane wilma made landfall across the state of florida 
metlife s cumulative gross losses from hurricane wilma were million and million at december  and  respectively  primarily arising from the company s homeowners and automobile businesses 
during the years ended december  and  the company s auto home segment recognized total losses  net of income tax and reinsurance recoverables  of million and million  respectively  related to hurricane wilma 
additional hurricane related losses may be recorded in future periods as claims are received from insureds and claims to reinsurers are processed 
reinsurance recoveries are dependent upon the continued creditworthiness of the reinsurers  which may be affected by their other reinsured losses in connection with hurricanes katrina and wilma and otherwise 
in addition  lawsuits  including purported class actions  have been filed in louisiana and mississippi challenging denial of claims for damages caused to property during hurricane katrina 
metropolitan property and casualty insurance company mpc is a named party in some of these lawsuits 
in addition  rulings in cases in which mpc is not a party may affect interpretation of its policies 
mpc intends to vigorously defend these matters 
however  any adverse rulings could result in an increase in the company s hurricane related claim exposure and losses 
based on information known by management  it does not believe that additional claim losses resulting from hurricane katrina will have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
summary of critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and 
table of contents assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the most critical estimates include those used in determining i the fair value of investments in the absence of quoted market values  ii investment impairments  iii the recognition of income on certain investments  iv application of the consolidation rules to certain investments  v the fair value of and accounting for derivatives  vi the capitalization and amortization of dac and the establishment and amortization of voba  vii the measurement of goodwill and related impairment  if any  viii the liability for future policyholder benefits  ix accounting for income taxes and the valuation of deferred tax assets  x accounting for reinsurance transactions  xi accounting for employee benefit plans  and xii the liability for litigation and regulatory matters 
the application of purchase accounting requires the use of estimation techniques in determining the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed the most significant of which relate to the aforementioned critical estimates 
in applying these policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s businesses and operations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
investments the company s principal investments are in fixed maturity and equity securities  mortgage and consumer loans  policy loans  real estate  real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships  short term investments  and other invested assets 
the company s investments are exposed to three primary sources of risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks  stemming from such investment risks  are those associated with the determination of fair values  the recognition of impairments  the recognition of income on certain investments  and the potential consolidation of previously unconsolidated subsidiaries 
the company s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities are classified as available for sale  except for trading securities  and are reported at their estimated fair value 
the fair values for public fixed maturity securities and public equity securities are based on quoted market prices or estimates from independent pricing services 
however  in cases where quoted market prices are not available  such as for private fixed maturities  fair values are estimated using present value or valuation techniques 
the determination of fair values in the absence of quoted market prices is based on i valuation methodologies  ii securities the company deems to be comparable  and iii assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances 
the fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time  based on available market information and judgments about financial instruments  including estimates of the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of the issuer or counterparty 
factors considered in estimating fair value include coupon rate  maturity  estimated duration  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  credit rating  industry sector of the issuer  and quoted market prices of comparable securities 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
one of the significant estimates related to available for sale securities is the evaluation of investments for other than temporary impairments 
the assessment of whether impairments have occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three 
table of contents categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
additionally  management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations used by the company in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to i the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost or amortized cost  ii the potential for impairments of securities when the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  iii the potential for impairments in an entire industry sector or sub sector  iv the potential for impairments in certain economically depressed geographic locations  v the potential for impairments of securities where the issuer  series of issuers or industry has suffered a catastrophic type of loss or has exhausted natural resources  vi the company s ability and intent to hold the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of its value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost  vii unfavorable changes in forecasted cash flows on asset backed securities  and viii other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
the cost of fixed maturity and equity securities is adjusted for impairments in value deemed to be other than temporary in the period in which the determination is made 
these impairments are included within net investment gains losses and the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities is reduced accordingly 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
the determination of the amount of allowances and impairments on other invested asset classes is highly subjective and is based upon the company s periodic evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class 
such evaluations and assessments are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available 
management updates its evaluations regularly and reflects changes in allowances and impairments in operations as such evaluations are revised 
the recognition of income on certain investments eg loan backed securities including mortgage backed and asset backed securities  certain investment transactions  trading securities  etc 
is dependent upon market conditions  which could result in prepayments and changes in amounts to be earned 
additionally  when the company enters into certain structured investment transactions  real estate joint ventures and other limited partnerships for which the company may be deemed to be the primary beneficiary under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 it may be required to consolidate such investments 
the accounting rules for the determination of the primary beneficiary are complex and require evaluation of the contractual rights and obligations associated with each party involved in the entity  an estimate of the entity s expected losses and expected residual returns and the allocation of such estimates to each party 
the use of different methodologies and assumptions as to the determination of the fair value of investments  the timing and amount of impairments  the recognition of income  or consolidation of investments may have a material effect on the amounts presented within the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents derivative financial instruments the company enters into freestanding derivative transactions including swaps  forwards  futures and option contracts 
the company uses derivatives primarily to manage various risks 
the risks being managed are variability in cash flows or changes in fair values related to financial instruments and currency exposure associated with net investments in certain foreign operations 
to a lesser extent  the company also uses credit derivatives to synthetically replicate investment risks and returns which are not readily available in the cash market 
the company also purchases investment securities  issues certain insurance policies and engages in certain reinsurance contracts that have embedded derivatives 
fair value of derivatives is determined by quoted market prices or through the use of pricing models 
the determination of fair values  when quoted market values are not available  is based on valuation methodologies and assumptions deemed appropriate under the circumstances 
values can be affected by changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  financial indices  credit spreads  market volatility and liquidity 
values can also be affected by changes in estimates and assumptions used in pricing models 
such assumptions include estimates of volatility  interest rates  foreign exchange rates  other financial indices and credit ratings 
essential to the analysis of the fair value is a risk of counterparty default 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated derivative fair value amounts  as well as the amount of reported net income 
also  fluctuations in the fair value of derivatives which have not been designated for hedge accounting may result in significant volatility in net income 
the accounting for derivatives is complex and interpretations of the primary accounting standards continue to evolve in practice 
judgment is applied in determining the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment under these accounting standards 
if it is determined that hedge accounting designations were not appropriately applied  reported net income could be materially affected 
differences in judgment as to the availability and application of hedge accounting designations and the appropriate accounting treatment may result in a differing impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company from that previously reported 
measurements of ineffectiveness of hedging relationships are also subject to interpretations and estimations and different interpretations or estimates may have a material effect on the amount reported in net income 
additionally  there is a risk that embedded derivatives requiring bifurcation have not been identified and reported at fair value in the consolidated financial statements and that their related changes in fair value could materially affect reported net income 
deferred policy acquisition costs and value of business acquired the company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new and renewal insurance business 
the costs that vary with and relate to the production of new business are deferred as dac 
such costs consist principally of commissions and agency and policy issue expenses 
voba is an intangible asset that reflects the estimated fair value of in force contracts in a life insurance company acquisition and represents the portion of the purchase price that is allocated to the value of the right to receive future cash flows from the business in force at the acquisition date 
voba is based on actuarially determined projections  by each block of business  of future policy and contract charges  premiums  mortality and morbidity  separate account performance  surrenders  operating expenses  investment returns and other factors 
actual experience on the purchased business may vary from these projections 
the recovery of dac and voba is dependent upon the future profitability of the related business 
dac and voba are aggregated in the financial statements for reporting purposes 
dac for property and casualty insurance contracts  which is primarily composed of commissions and certain underwriting expenses  is amortized on a pro rata basis over the applicable contract term or reinsurance treaty 
dac and voba on life insurance or investment type contracts are amortized in proportion to gross premiums  gross margins or gross profits  depending on the type of contract as described below 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to non participating and non dividend paying traditional contracts term insurance  non participating whole life insurance  non medical health insurance  and traditional group life insurance over the entire premium paying period in proportion to the present value of actual historic and expected future gross premiums 
the present value of expected premiums is based upon the premium requirement 
table of contents of each policy and assumptions for mortality  morbidity  persistency  and investment returns at policy issuance  or policy acquisition  as it relates to voba  that include provisions for adverse deviation and are consistent with the assumptions used to calculate future policyholder benefit liabilities 
these assumptions are not revised after policy issuance or acquisition unless the dac or voba balance is deemed to be unrecoverable from future expected profits 
absent a premium deficiency  variability in amortization after policy issuance or acquisition is caused only by variability in premium volumes 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to participating  dividend paying traditional contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross margins 
the amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts 
the future gross margins are dependent principally on investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  mortality  persistency  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties  and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
for participating contracts dividend paying traditional contracts within the closed block future gross margins are also dependent upon changes in the policyholder dividend obligation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns  expenses  persistency  and other factor changes and policyholder dividend scales are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of dac and voba amortization 
each reporting period  the company updates the estimated gross margins with the actual gross margins for that period 
when the actual gross margins change from previously estimated gross margins  the cumulative dac and voba amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
when actual gross margins exceed those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the actual gross margins are below the previously estimated gross margins 
each reporting period  the company also updates the actual amount of business in force  which impacts expected future gross margins 
the company amortizes dac and voba related to fixed and variable universal life contracts and fixed and variable deferred annuity contracts over the estimated lives of the contracts in proportion to actual and expected future gross profits 
the amortization includes interest based on rates in effect at inception or acquisition of the contracts 
the amount of future gross profits is dependent principally upon returns in excess of the amounts credited to policyholders  mortality  persistency  interest crediting rates  expenses to administer the business  creditworthiness of reinsurance counterparties  the effect of any hedges used  and certain economic variables  such as inflation 
of these factors  the company anticipates that investment returns  expenses  and persistency are reasonably likely to impact significantly the rate of dac and voba amortization 
each reporting period  the company updates the estimated gross profits with the actual gross profits for that period 
when the actual gross profits change from previously estimated gross profits  the cumulative dac and voba amortization is re estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to current operations 
when actual gross profits exceed those previously estimated  the dac and voba amortization will increase  resulting in a current period charge to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the actual gross profits are below the previously estimated gross profits 
each reporting period  the company also updates the actual amount of business remaining in force  which impacts expected future gross profits 
separate account rates of return on variable universal life contracts and variable deferred annuity contracts affect in force account balances on such contracts each reporting period 
returns that are higher than the company s long term expectation produce higher account balances  which increases the company s future fee expectations and decreases future benefit payment expectations on minimum death benefit guarantees  resulting in higher expected future gross profits 
the opposite result occurs when returns are lower than the company s long term expectation 
the company s practice to determine the impact of gross profits resulting from returns on separate accounts assumes that long term appreciation in equity markets is not changed by short term market fluctuations  but is only changed when sustained interim deviations are expected 
the company monitors these changes and only changes the assumption when its long term expectation changes 
the effect of an increase decrease by basis points in the assumed future rate of return is reasonably likely to result in a decrease increase in the dac and voba balances of approximately million for this factor 
the company also reviews periodically other long term assumptions underlying the projections of estimated gross margins and profits 
these include investment returns  policyholder dividend scales  interest crediting rates  mortality  persistency  and expenses to administer business 
management annually updates assumptions used in the 
table of contents calculation of estimated gross margins and profits which may have significantly changed 
if the update of assumptions causes expected future gross margins and profits to increase  dac and voba amortization will decrease  resulting in a current period increase to earnings 
the opposite result occurs when the assumption update causes expected future gross margins and profits to decrease 
over the past two years  the company s most significant assumption updates resulting in a change to expected future gross margins and profits and the amortization of dac and voba have been updated due to revisions to expected future investment returns  expenses  in force or persistency assumptions and policyholder dividends on contracts included within the individual business segment 
the company expects these assumptions to be the ones most reasonably likely to cause significant changes in the future 
changes in these assumptions can be offsetting and the company is unable to predict their movement or offsetting impact over time 
the following chart illustrates the effect on dac and voba within the company s individual segment of changing each of the respective assumptions during the years ended december  and years ended december  in millions investment return expense in force persistency policyholder dividends and other total as of december  and  dac and voba for the individual segment were billion and billion  respectively  and for the total company were billion and billion  respectively 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed using the fair value approach  which requires the use of estimates and judgment  at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the operating segment or a business that is one level below the operating segment  if discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by management at that level 
for purposes of goodwill impairment testing  goodwill within corporate other is allocated to reporting units within the company s business segments 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  the excess is recognized as an impairment and recorded as a charge against net income 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined using a market multiple  a discounted cash flow model  or a cost approach 
the critical estimates necessary in determining fair value are projected earnings  comparative market multiples and the discount rate 
liability for future policy benefits the company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under insurance policies  including traditional life insurance  traditional annuities and non medical health insurance 
generally  amounts are payable over an extended period of time and related liabilities are calculated as the present value of future expected benefits to be paid  reduced by the present value of future expected premiums 
such liabilities are established based on methods and underlying assumptions in accordance with gaap and applicable actuarial standards 
principal assumptions used in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are mortality  morbidity  policy lapse  renewal  retirement  investment returns  inflation  expenses and other contingent events as appropriate to the respective product type 
these assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are intended to estimate the experience for the period the policy benefits are payable 
utilizing these assumptions  liabilities are established on a 
table of contents block of business basis 
if experience is less favorable than assumptions  additional liabilities may be required  resulting in a charge to policyholder benefits and claims 
liabilities for future policy benefits for disabled lives are estimated using the present value of benefits method and experience assumptions as to claim terminations  expenses and interest 
liabilities for unpaid claims and claim expenses for property and casualty insurance are included in future policyholder benefits and represent the amount estimated for claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported 
other policyholder funds include claims that have been reported but not settled and claims incurred but not reported on life and non medical health insurance 
liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated based upon the company s historical experience and other actuarial assumptions that consider the effects of current developments  anticipated trends and risk management programs 
with respect to property and casualty insurance  such unpaid claims are reduced for anticipated salvage and subrogation 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
future policy benefit liabilities for minimum death and income benefit guarantees relating to certain annuity contracts and secondary and paid up guarantees relating to certain life policies are based on estimates of the expected value of benefits in excess of the projected account balance and recognizing the excess ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
liabilities for universal and variable life secondary guarantees and paid up guarantees are determined by estimating the expected value of death benefits payable when the account balance is projected to be zero and recognizing those benefits ratably over the accumulation period based on total expected assessments 
the assumptions used in estimating these liabilities are consistent with those used for amortizing dac  and are thus subject to the same variability and risk 
the company offers certain variable annuity products with guaranteed minimum benefit riders 
these include guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit gmwb riders and guaranteed minimum accumulation benefit gmab riders 
gmwb and gmab riders are embedded derivatives  which are measured at fair value separately from the host variable annuity contract  with changes in fair value reported in net investment gains losses 
the fair values of gmwb and gmab riders are calculated based on actuarial and capital market assumptions related to the projected cash flows  including benefits and related contract charges  over the lives of the contracts  incorporating expectations concerning policyholder behavior 
these riders may be more costly than expected in volatile or declining equity markets  causing an increase in the liability for future policy benefits  negatively affecting net income 
the company periodically reviews its estimates of actuarial liabilities for future policy benefits and compares them with its actual experience 
differences between actual experience and the assumptions used in pricing these policies  guarantees and riders and in the establishment of the related liabilities result in variances in profit and could result in losses 
the effects of changes in such estimated liabilities are included in the results of operations in the period in which the changes occur 
income taxes income taxes represent the net amount of income taxes that the company expects to pay to or receive from various taxing jurisdictions in connection with its operations 
the company provides for federal  state and foreign income taxes currently payable  as well as those deferred due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company s accounting for income taxes represents management s best estimate of various events and transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
the realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction 
valuation allowances are established when management determines based on available information  that it is more likely than not that deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
significant 
table of contents judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be established as well as the amount of such allowances 
when making such determination  consideration is given to  among other things  the following i future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  ii future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  iii taxable income in prior carryback years  and iv tax planning strategies 
the company may be required to change its provision for income taxes in certain circumstances 
examples of such circumstances include when the ultimate deductibility of certain items is challenged by taxing authorities or when estimates used in determining valuation allowances on deferred tax assets significantly change or when receipt of new information indicates the need for adjustment in valuation allowances 
additionally  future events such as changes in tax legislation could have an impact on the provision for income tax and the effective tax rate 
any such changes could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements in the year these changes occur 
reinsurance the company enters into reinsurance transactions as both a provider and a purchaser of reinsurance for its life and property and casualty insurance products 
accounting for reinsurance requires extensive use of assumptions and estimates  particularly related to the future performance of the underlying business and the potential impact of counterparty credit risks 
the company periodically reviews actual and anticipated experience compared to the aforementioned assumptions used to establish assets and liabilities relating to ceded and assumed reinsurance and evaluates the financial strength of counterparties to its reinsurance agreements using criteria similar to that evaluated in the security impairment process discussed previously 
additionally  for each of its reinsurance contracts  the company determines if the contract provides indemnification against loss or liability relating to insurance risk  in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
the company reviews all contractual features  particularly those that may limit the amount of insurance risk to which the reinsurer is subject or features that delay the timely reimbursement of claims 
if the company determines that a reinsurance contract does not expose the reinsurer to a reasonable possibility of a significant loss from insurance risk  the company records the contract using the deposit method of accounting 
employee benefit plans certain subsidiaries of the holding company the subsidiaries sponsor pension and other postretirement plans covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
the obligations and expenses associated with these plans require an extensive use of assumptions such as the discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  healthcare cost trend rates  as well as assumptions regarding participant demographics such as rate and age of retirements  withdrawal rates and mortality 
management  in consultation with its independent consulting actuarial firm  determines these assumptions based upon a variety of factors such as historical performance of the plan and its assets  currently available market and industry data and expected benefit payout streams 
the assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to  among other factors  changing market and economic conditions and changes in participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial statements and liquidity 
litigation contingencies the company is a party to a number of legal actions and is involved in a number of regulatory investigations 
given the inherent unpredictability of these matters  it is difficult to estimate the impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
liabilities are established when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
liabilities related to certain lawsuits  including the company s asbestos related liability  are especially difficult to estimate due to the limitation of available data and uncertainty regarding numerous variables that can affect liability estimates 
the data and variables that impact the assumptions used to estimate the company s asbestos related liability include the number of future claims  the cost to resolve 
table of contents claims  the disease mix and severity of disease in pending and future claims  the impact of the number of new claims filed in a particular jurisdiction and variations in the law in the jurisdictions in which claims are filed  the possible impact of tort reform efforts  the willingness of courts to allow plaintiffs to pursue claims against the company when exposure to asbestos took place after the dangers of asbestos exposure were well known  and the impact of any possible future adverse verdicts and their amounts 
on a quarterly and annual basis the company reviews relevant information with respect to liabilities for litigation  regulatory investigations and litigation related contingencies to be reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
it is possible that an adverse outcome in certain of the company s litigation and regulatory investigations  including asbestos related cases  or the use of different assumptions in the determination of amounts recorded could have a material effect upon the company s consolidated net income or cash flows in particular quarterly or annual periods 
economic capital economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model  the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed 
the economic capital model accounts for the unique and specific nature of the risks inherent in metlife s businesses 
as a part of the economic capital process  a portion of net investment income is credited to the segments based on the level of allocated equity 
this is in contrast to the standardized regulatory risk based capital rbc formula  which is not as refined in its risk calculations with respect to the nuances of the company s businesses

excluding the impact of the acquisition of travelers  which contributed  million during the first six months of to the year over year increase  net investment income increased by million of which management attributes million to growth in the average asset base and million to an increase in yields 
this increase was primarily due to an overall increase in the asset base  an increase in fixed maturity security yields  improved results on real estate and real estate joint ventures  mortgage loans  and other limited partnership interests  as well as higher short term interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in investment income from securities lending results  and bond and commercial mortgage prepayment fees 
interest margin interest margin  which represents the difference between interest earned and interest credited to pabs  decreased in the institutional and individual segments for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
interest earned approximates net investment income on investable assets attributed to the segment with minor adjustments related to the consolidation of certain separate accounts and other minor non policyholder elements 
interest credited is the amount attributed to insurance products  recorded in policyholder benefits  and the amount credited to pabs for investment type products  recorded in interest credited to pabs 
interest credited on insurance products reflects the current period impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance or acquisition 
interest credited to pabs is subject to contractual terms  including some minimum guarantees 
this tends to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to competitive pressures and  therefore  generally does not introduce volatility in expense 
net investment gains losses net investment losses increased by  million to a loss of  million for the year ended december  from a loss of million for the comparable period 
excluding the impact of the acquisition of travelers  which contributed a loss of million during the first six months of to the year over year increase  net investment losses increased by million

interest credited on insurance products reflects the current period impact of the interest rate assumptions established at issuance or acquisition 
interest credited to pabs is subject to contractual terms  including some minimum guarantees 
this tends to move gradually over time to reflect market interest rate movements and may reflect actions by management to respond to competitive pressures and  therefore  generally does not introduce volatility in expense 
underwriting underwriting results were favorable within the life products in the individual and institutional segments  while underwriting results were unfavorable in the reinsurance segment and in the retirement savings and non medical health other products within the institutional segment

table of contents liquidity and capital resources the company capital rbc requirements are used as minimum capital requirements by the national association of insurance commissioners naic and the state insurance departments to identify companies that merit further regulatory action on an annual basis 
rbc is based on a formula calculated by applying factors to various asset  premium and statutory reserve items 
the formula takes into account the risk characteristics of the insurer  including asset risk  insurance risk  interest rate risk and business risk and is calculated on an annual basis 
the formula is used as an early warning regulatory tool to identify possible inadequately capitalized insurers for purposes of initiating regulatory action  and not as a means to rank insurers generally 
these rules apply to each of the holding company s domestic insurance subsidiaries 
as of the date of the most recent statutory financial statements filed with insurance regulators  the total adjusted capital of each of these subsidiaries was in excess of the most recently referenced rbc based amount calculated at december  the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles codification in to standardize regulatory accounting and reporting to state insurance departments 
however  statutory accounting principles continue to be established by individual state laws and permitted practices 
the new york state department of insurance the department has adopted codification with certain modifications for the preparation of statutory financial statements of insurance companies domiciled in new york 
modifications by the various state insurance departments may impact the effect of codification on the statutory capital and surplus of the holding company s domestic insurance subsidiaries

the company establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
in executing these asset liability matching strategies  management regularly reevaluates the estimates used in determining the approximate amounts and timing of payments to or on behalf of policyholders for insurance liabilities

under sfas  the projected pension benefit obligation pbo is defined as the actuarially calculated present value of vested and non vested pension benefits accrued based on future salary levels 
the accumulated pension benefit obligation abo is the actuarial present value of vested and non vested pension benefits accrued based on current salary levels 
the pbo and abo of the pension plans are set forth in the following section 
prior to december   sfas also required the recognition of an additional minimum pension liability and an intangible asset limited to unrecognized prior service cost if the market value of pension plan assets was less than the abo at the measurement date 
the excess of the additional minimum pension liability over the allowable intangible asset was charged  net of taxes  to accumulated other comprehensive income

unlike the pbo for pensions  the epbo is not recorded in the financial statements but is used in measuring the periodic expense 
the accumulated postretirement plan benefit obligations apbo represents the actuarial present value of future postretirement benefits attributed to employee services rendered through a particular date 
the apbo is recorded in the financial statements and is set forth below

r sfas  effective december  upon adoption  the company was required to recognize in the consolidated balance sheet the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
funded status is measured as the difference between the fair 
table of contents value of plan assets and the benefit obligation  which is the pbo for pension plans and the apbo for other postretirement plans 
the change to recognize funded status eliminated the additional minimum pension liability provisions of sfas in addition  the company recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income tax  those amounts of actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs and credits  and the remaining net transition asset or obligation that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as of the date of adoption 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a reduction of million  net of income tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included as a component of total consolidated stockholders equity

some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate used to determine the present value of future benefit payments  the expected rate of compensation increases and average expected retirement age 
assumptions used in determining pension plan obligations were as follows december  weighted average discount rate rate of compensation increase average expected retirement age the discount rate is determined annually based on the yield  measured on a yield to worst basis  of a hypothetical portfolio constructed of high quality debt instruments available on the valuation date  which would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the aggregate pbo when due 
the yield of this hypothetical portfolio  constructed of bonds rated aa or better by moody s investors services resulted in a discount rate of approximately and for the defined pension plans as of december  and  respectively 

table of contents a decrease increase in the discount rate increases decreases the pbo 
this increase decrease to the pbo is amortized into earnings as an actuarial loss gain 
based on the december  pbo  a basis point decrease increase in the discount rate would result in an increase decrease in the pbo of approximately million 
at the end of  total net actuarial losses were  million  as compared to  million in the majority of these net actuarial losses are due to lower discount rates in recent years 
these losses will be amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the benefit plans 
at the end of  the average remaining service period of active employees was years for the pension plans 
as the benefits provided under the defined pension plans are calculated as a percentage of future earnings  an assumption of future compensation increases is required to determine the projected benefit obligation 
these rates are derived through periodic analysis of historical demographic data conducted by an independent actuarial firm 
the last review of such data was conducted using salary information through and the company believes that no circumstances have subsequently occurred that would result in a material change to the compensation rate assumptions 
other postretirement benefit plan obligations the apbo is determined using a variety of actuarial assumptions  from which actual results may vary 
some of the more significant of these assumptions include the discount rate  the healthcare cost trend rate and the average expected retirement age 
the determination of the discount rate and the average expected retirement age are substantially consistent with the determination described previously for the pension plans 
the assumed healthcare cost trend rates used in measuring the apbo were as follows december  pre medicare eligible claims down to in down to in medicare eligible claims down to in down to in assumed healthcare cost trend rates may have a significant effect on the amounts reported for healthcare plans

the adoption of sfas resulted in a reduction of million  net of income tax  to accumulated other comprehensive income  which is included as a component of total consolidated stockholders equity 
as the company s measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans is already december there is no impact of adoption due to changes in measurement date

in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
sfas r requires that the cost of all stock based transactions be measured at fair value and recognized over the period during which a grantee is required to provide goods or services in exchange for the award 
the company had previously adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based awards as prescribed by sfas on a prospective basis effective january   and prior to january   accounted for its stock based awards to employees under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb the company did not modify the substantive terms of any existing awards prior to adoption of sfas r

sfas allowed forfeitures of stock based awards to be recognized as a reduction of compensation expense in the period in which the forfeiture occurred 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company changed its policy and now incorporates an estimate of future forfeitures into the determination of compensation expense when recognizing expense over the requisite service period 
the impact of this change in accounting policy was not significant to the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents additionally  for awards granted after adoption  the company changed its policy from recognizing expense for stock based awards over the requisite service period to recognizing such expense over the shorter of the requisite service period or the period to attainment of retirement eligibility 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company presented tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options within operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r requires tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options be classified and reported as a financing cash inflow upon adoption of sfas r

fixed maturity and equity security impairment 
the company classifies all of its fixed maturity and equity securities as available for sale and marks them to market through other comprehensive income  except for non marketable private equities  which are generally carried at cost and trading securities which are carried at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recognized in net investment income 
all securities with gross unrealized losses at the consolidated balance sheet date are subjected to the company s process for identifying other than temporary impairments 
the company writes down to fair value securities that it deems to be other than temporarily impaired in the period the securities are deemed to be so impaired 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors  as described in summary of critical accounting estimates investments  about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
the company s review of its fixed maturity and equity securities for impairments includes an analysis of the total gross unrealized losses by three categories of securities i securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by less than  ii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for less than six months  and iii securities where the estimated fair value had declined and remained below cost or amortized cost by or more for six months or greater 
while all of these securities are monitored for potential impairment  the company s experience indicates that the first two categories do not present as great a risk of impairment  and often  fair values recover over time as the factors that caused the declines improve 
the company records impairments as investment losses and adjusts the cost basis of the fixed maturity and equity securities accordingly 
the company does not change the revised cost basis for subsequent recoveries in value 
impairments of fixed maturity and equity securities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

these securities represented  or million in the aggregate  of the gross unrealized loss on fixed maturity securities and equity securities

these securities are concentrated  calculated as a percentage of gross unrealized loss  as follows december  sector us corporate securities residential mortgage backed securities foreign corporate securities us treasury agency securities commercial mortgage backed securities other total industry industrial mortgage backed government finance utility other total as described previously  the company performs a regular evaluation  on a security by security basis  of its investment holdings in accordance with its impairment policy in order to evaluate whether such securities are other than temporarily impaired 
one of the criteria which the company considers in its other than temporary impairment analysis is its intent and ability to hold securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery of their value to an amount equal to or greater than cost or amortized cost 
the company s intent and ability to hold securities considers broad portfolio management objectives such as asset liability duration management  issuer and industry segment exposures  interest rate views and the overall total return focus 
in following these portfolio management objectives  changes in facts and circumstances that were present in past reporting periods may trigger a decision to sell securities that were held in prior reporting periods 
decisions to sell are based on current conditions or the company s need to shift the portfolio to maintain its portfolio management objectives including liquidity needs or duration targets on asset liability managed portfolios 
the company attempts to anticipate these types of changes and if a sale decision has been made on an impaired security and that security is not expected to recover prior to the expected time of sale  the security will be deemed other than temporarily impaired in the period that the sale decision was made and an other than temporary impairment loss will be recognized 
based upon the company s current evaluation of the securities in accordance with its impairment policy  the cause of the decline being principally attributable to the general rise in rates during the holding period  and the company s current intent and ability to hold the fixed maturity and equity securities with unrealized losses for a period of time sufficient for them to recover  the company has concluded that the aforementioned securities are not other than temporarily impaired

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company must effectively manage  measure and monitor the market risk associated with its invested assets and interest rate sensitive insurance contracts 
it has developed an integrated process for managing risk  which it conducts through its corporate risk management department  alm committees and additional specialists at the business segment level 
the company has established and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures at both the corporate and business segment level to minimize the effects of potential market volatility 
the company regularly analyzes its exposure to interest rate  equity market and foreign currency exchange risk 
as a result of that analysis  the company has determined that the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets is materially exposed to changes in interest rates 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk as described below 
metlife generally uses option adjusted duration to manage interest rate risk and the methods and assumptions used are generally consistent with those used by the company in the company analyzes interest rate risk using various models including multi scenario cash flow projection models that forecast cash flows of the liabilities and their supporting investments  including derivative instruments 
the company uses a variety of strategies to manage interest rate  equity market  and foreign currency exchange risk  including the use of derivative instruments 
market risk exposures the company has exposure to market risk through its insurance operations and investment activities 
for purposes of this disclosure  market risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting from changes in interest rates  equity market prices and foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate changes results from its significant holdings of fixed maturity securities  as well as its interest rate sensitive liabilities 
the fixed maturity securities include us and foreign government bonds  securities issued by government agencies  corporate bonds and mortgage backed securities  all of which are mainly exposed to changes in medium and long term treasury rates 
the interest rate sensitive liabilities for purposes of this disclosure include gics and annuities  which have the same type of interest rate exposure medium and long term treasury rates as fixed maturity securities 
the company employs product design  pricing and asset liability management strategies to reduce the adverse effects of interest rate movements 
product design and pricing strategies include the use of surrender charges or restrictions on withdrawals in some products 
asset liability management strategies include the use of derivatives  the purchase of securities structured to protect against prepayments  prepayment restrictions and related fees on mortgage loans and consistent monitoring of the pricing of the company s products in order to better match the duration of the assets and the liabilities they support 
see also risk factors changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability 
equity market prices 
the company s investments in equity securities expose it to changes in equity prices  as do certain liabilities that involve long term guarantees on equity performance 
it manages this risk on an integrated basis with other risks through its asset liability management strategies 
the company also manages equity market price risk through industry and issuer diversification  asset allocation techniques and the use of derivatives 
foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar results from its holdings in non us dollar denominated fixed maturity securities  equity securities and liabilities  as well as through its investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the principal currencies that create foreign currency exchange rate risk in the company s investment portfolios are the euro  the canadian dollar and the british pound 
the company mitigates its fixed maturity securities foreign currency exchange rate risk through the utilization of foreign currency swaps and forward contracts 
through its investments in foreign subsidiaries  the company is primarily exposed to the canadian dollar  the mexican peso  the australian dollar  the argentinean peso  the south korean won  the chilean peso  the taiwanese dollar and the japanese yen 
the company has matched substantially all of its foreign currency liabilities in its foreign subsidiaries with their respective foreign currency assets  thereby reducing its risk to currency exchange rate fluctuation 
selectively  the company uses us dollar assets to support certain long duration foreign currency liabilities 
additionally  in some countries  local surplus is held entirely or in part in us dollar assets which further minimizes exposure to exchange rate fluctuation risk 
risk management corporate risk management 
metlife has established several financial and non financial senior management committees as part of its risk management process 
these committees manage capital and risk positions  approve asset liability management strategies and establish appropriate corporate business standards 
metlife also has a separate corporate risk management department  which is responsible for risk throughout metlife and reports to metlife s chief financial officer 
the corporate risk management department s primary responsibilities consist of implementing a board of directors approved corporate risk framework  which outlines the company s approach for managing risk on an enterprise wide basis  developing policies and procedures for managing  measuring and monitoring those risks identified in the corporate risk framework  establishing appropriate corporate risk tolerance levels  deploying capital on an economic capital basis  and reporting on a periodic basis to the governance committee of the holding company s board of directors and various financial and non financial senior management committees 
asset liability management 
the company actively manages its assets using an approach that balances quality  diversification  asset liability matching  liquidity and investment return 
the goals of the investment process are to optimize  net of income tax  risk adjusted investment income and risk adjusted total return while ensuring that the assets and liabilities are managed on a cash flow and duration basis 
the asset liability management process is the shared responsibility of the portfolio management unit  the financial management and oversight asset liability management unit  and the operating business segments under the supervision of the 
table of contents various product line specific alm committees 
the alm committees duties include reviewing and approving target portfolios on a periodic basis  establishing investment guidelines and limits and providing oversight of the asset liability management process 
the portfolio managers and asset sector specialists  who have responsibility on a day to day basis for risk management of their respective investing activities  implement the goals and objectives established by the alm committees 
see also risk factors changes in market interest rates may significantly affect our profitability 
each of metlife s business segments has an asset liability officer who works with portfolio managers in the investment department to monitor investment  product pricing  hedge strategy and liability management issues 
metlife establishes target asset portfolios for each major insurance product  which represent the investment strategies used to profitably fund its liabilities within acceptable levels of risk 
these strategies are monitored through regular review of portfolio metrics  such as effective duration  yield curve sensitivity  convexity  liquidity  asset sector concentration and credit quality 
to manage interest rate risk  the company performs periodic projections of asset and liability cash flows to evaluate the potential sensitivity of its securities investments and liabilities to interest rate movements 
these projections involve evaluating the potential gain or loss on most of the company s in force business under various increasing and decreasing interest rate environments 
department regulations require that metlife perform some of these analyses annually as part of metlife s review of the sufficiency of its regulatory reserves 
for several of its legal entities  the company maintains segmented operating and surplus asset portfolios for the purpose of asset liability management and the allocation of investment income to product lines 
for each segment  invested assets greater than or equal to the gaap liabilities less the dac asset and any non invested assets allocated to the segment are maintained  with any excess swept to the surplus segment 
the operating segments may reflect differences in legal entity  statutory line of business and any product market characteristic which may drive a distinct investment strategy with respect to duration  liquidity or credit quality of the invested assets 
certain smaller entities make use of unsegmented general accounts for which the investment strategy reflects the aggregate characteristics of liabilities in those entities 
the company measures relative sensitivities of the value of its assets and liabilities to changes in key assumptions utilizing company models 
these models reflect specific product characteristics and include assumptions based on current and anticipated experience regarding lapse  mortality and interest crediting rates 
in addition  these models include asset cash flow projections reflecting interest payments  sinking fund payments  principal payments  bond calls  mortgage prepayments and defaults 
common industry metrics  such as duration and convexity  are also used to measure the relative sensitivity of assets and liability values to changes in interest rates 
in computing the duration of liabilities  consideration is given to all policyholder guarantees and to how the company intends to set indeterminate policy elements such as interest credits or dividends 
each operating asset segment has a duration constraint based on the liability duration and the investment objectives of that portfolio 
where a liability cash flow may exceed the maturity of available assets  as is the case with certain retirement and non medical health products  the company may support such liabilities with equity investments or curve mismatch strategies 
hedging activities 
to reduce interest rate risk  metlife s risk management strategies incorporate the use of various interest rate derivatives to adjust the overall duration and cash flow profile of its invested asset portfolios to better match the duration and cash flow profile of its liabilities 
such instruments include financial futures  financial forwards  interest rate and credit default swaps  caps  floors and options 
metlife also uses foreign currency swaps and forwards to hedge its foreign currency denominated fixed income investments 
in  metlife initiated a hedging strategy for certain equity price risks within its liabilities using equity futures and options 
risk measurement sensitivity analysis the company measures market risk related to its holdings of invested assets and other financial instruments  including certain market risk sensitive insurance contracts  based on changes in interest rates  equity market prices and currency exchange rates  utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
this analysis estimates the potential changes in fair value  cash flows and earnings based on a hypothetical change increase or decrease in interest rates  equity market prices and currency exchange rates 
the company believes that a change increase or decrease in these market rates and prices is reasonably possible in the near term 
in performing this analysis  the company used market rates at december  to re price its invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity 
table of contents analysis separately calculated each of metlife s market risk exposures interest rate  equity market price and foreign currency exchange rate related to its trading and non trading invested assets and other financial instruments 
the sensitivity analysis performed included the market risk sensitive holdings described above 
the company modeled the impact of changes in market rates and prices on the fair values of its invested assets  earnings and cash flows as follows fair values 
the company bases its potential change in fair values on an immediate change increase or decrease in the net present values of its interest rate sensitive exposures resulting from a change increase or decrease in interest rates  the market value of its equity positions due to a change increase or decrease in equity prices  and the us dollar equivalent balances of the company s currency exposures due to a change increase or decrease in currency exchange rates 
earnings and cash flows 
metlife calculates the potential change in earnings and cash flows on the change in its earnings and cash flows over a one year period based on an immediate change increase or decrease in interest rates and equity prices 
the following factors were incorporated into the earnings and sensitivity analyses the reinvestment of fixed maturity securities  the reinvestment of payments and prepayments of principal related to mortgage backed securities  the re estimation of prepayment rates on mortgage backed securities for each change increase or decrease in interest rates  and the expected turnover sales of fixed maturity and equity securities  including the reinvestment of the resulting proceeds 
the sensitivity analysis is an estimate and should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance 
the company cannot assure that its actual losses in any particular year will not exceed the amounts indicated in the table below 
limitations related to this sensitivity analysis include the market risk information is limited by the assumptions and parameters established in creating the related sensitivity analysis  including the impact of prepayment rates on mortgages  for derivatives that qualify as hedges  the impact on reported earnings may be materially different from the change in market values  the analysis excludes other significant real estate holdings and liabilities pursuant to insurance contracts  and the model assumes that the composition of assets and liabilities remains unchanged throughout the year 
accordingly  the company uses such models as tools and not substitutes for the experience and judgment of its corporate risk and asset liability management personnel 
based on its analysis of the impact of a change increase or decrease in market rates and prices  metlife has determined that such a change could have a material adverse effect on the fair value of its interest rate sensitive invested assets 
the equity and foreign currency portfolios do not expose the company to material market risk 
the table below illustrates the potential loss in fair value of the company s interest rate sensitive financial instruments at december  in addition  the potential loss with respect to the fair value of currency exchange rates and the company s equity price sensitive positions at december  is set forth in the table below 
the potential loss in fair value for each market risk exposure of the company s portfolio was december  in millions non trading interest rate risk equity price risk foreign currency exchange rate risk trading interest rate risk

these increases are partially offset by a decrease of million due to growth in derivative usage and a decrease of million due to a decline in asset duration 
in addition to the analysis above  as part of its asset liability management program  the company also performs an analysis of the sensitivity to changes in interest rates  including both insurance liabilities and financial instruments 
as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates applied to the company s liabilities  insurance and associated asset portfolios would reduce the fair value of equity by million 
management does not expect that this sensitivity would produce a liquidity strain on the company
