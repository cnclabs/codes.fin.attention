item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview denny s revenues are primarily derived from two sources the sale of food and beverages at our company owned restaurants and the collection of royalties and fees from restaurants operated by our franchisees under the denny s name 
sales are affected by many factors including competition  economic conditions affecting consumer spending  weather and changes in customer tastes and preferences 
two primary sales drivers are changes in same store sales and the number of restaurants 
same store sales are comprised of the changes in guest check average and guest counts 
we continue to focus on identifying and closing low performing units 
as a result  company owned and franchise units decreased by and units  respectively  during netted in the unit decreases were the opening of three company owned and franchisee restaurants 
development of company owned restaurants will focus on flagship locations in denny s core markets 
we expect that the majority of new denny s restaurants will be developed by our franchisees 
our costs of company owned restaurant sales are exposed to volatility in two main areas product costs and payroll and benefit costs 
many of the products sold in our restaurants are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility 
this volatility is caused by factors that are fundamentally outside of our control and are often unpredictable 
in general  we purchase food products based on market prices  or we lock in prices in purchase agreements with our vendors 
in addition  some of our purchasing agreements contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing price ceilings and or floors 
while we will address commodity cost increases which are significant and considered long term in nature by adjusting menu prices  competitive circumstances can limit such actions 
payroll and benefit costs volatility results primarily from changes in wage rates and increases in labor related expenses such as medical benefit costs and workers compensation costs 
a number of our employees are paid the minimum wage 
accordingly  substantial increases in the minimum wage increases our labor costs 
additionally  declines in guest counts and investments in store level labor can cause payroll and benefit costs to increase as a percentage of sales 
franchise and license revenues are the revenues received by denny s from its franchisees and include royalties based on a percentage of sales of franchise operated restaurants  initial franchise fees and occupancy revenue related to restaurants leased or subleased to franchisees 
during  we sold franchise operated real estate properties 
occupancy revenue  included in franchise and license revenue in  related to the sold properties was approximately million 
our costs of franchise and license revenue include occupancy costs related to restaurants leased or subleased to franchisees and direct costs consisting primarily of payroll and benefit costs of franchise operations personnel  bad debt expense and marketing expenses net of marketing contributions received from franchisees 
occupancy costs  included in costs of franchise and license revenue in  related to the sold properties were approximately million 
franchise and licensing revenues are generally billed and collected from franchisees on a weekly basis which minimizes the impact of bad debts on our costs of franchise and license revenues 
interest expense has a significant impact on our net income loss as a result of our substantial indebtedness 
however  during we continued to reduce interest expense through a series of debt repayments and a refinancing of our credit facilities  contributing to an overall debt reduction of more than million 
we are subject to the effects of interest rate volatility since approximately of our debt has variable interest rates

the provision for income taxes was million compared with million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we have provided valuation allowances related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to our net operating losses generated in previous periods 
in establishing our valuation allowance  we had previously taken into consideration certain tax planning strategies involving the sale of appreciated properties 
the increased deferred tax provision of million for the year ended december  related to our reevaluation of our tax planning strategies in light of the sale of appreciated properties during the year 
in addition  during  we utilized certain state net operating loss carryforwards whose valuation allowance was established in connection with fresh start reporting on january  as a result  we recorded approximately million of state deferred tax expense with a corresponding reduction to the goodwill that was recorded in connection with fresh start reporting on january  as a result of adopting sfas r  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax of million in the first quarter of see note to our consolidated financial statements

we have provided valuation allowances related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to our net operating losses 
accordingly  no additional benefit from or provision for income taxes has been reported for the periods presented 
in establishing our valuation allowance  we have taken into consideration certain tax planning strategies involving the sale of appreciated properties in order to alter the timing of the expiration of certain net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards in the event they were to expire unused 
such strategies  if implemented in future periods  are considered by us to be prudent and feasible in light of current circumstances 
circumstances may change in future periods such that we can no longer conclude that such tax planning strategies are prudent and feasible  which would require us to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances 
without such tax planning strategies  our valuation allowance would have increased by approximately million in during  such strategies were implemented which required the recording of additional deferred tax valuation allowance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further explanation 
net loss was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  due to the factors noted above 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash generated from operations  borrowing under our credit facilities as described below and  in recent years  cash proceeds from the sale of surplus properties and the sale of real estate to franchisees 
principal uses of cash are operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt repayments 
the following table presents a summary of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the periods indicated fiscal year ended december  december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents we believe that our estimated cash flows from operations for  combined with our capacity for additional borrowings under our new credit facility defined below  will enable us to meet our anticipated cash requirements and fund capital expenditures through the end of net cash flows provided by investing activities were million for our principal capital requirements have been largely associated with remodeling and maintaining our existing company owned restaurants and facilities 
our capital expenditures for were million  of which million was financed through capital leases 
these capital expenditures included million related to the rollout of our new pos system  of which million was financed through capital leases 
capital expenditures in were offset by net proceeds of million from the disposition of assets  including company owned franchisee operated real estate properties and five surplus real estate properties 
as required by our credit facilities  much of the net proceeds  in addition to cash from operations  was used to prepay balances outstanding under our credit facilities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million for  which included more than million of prepayments and scheduled debt payments made through a combination of asset sale proceeds  as noted above  and surplus cash 
on december   our subsidiaries  denny s  inc and denny s realty  llc formerly denny s realty  inc the borrowers  refinanced our previous credit facilities old credit facilities and entered into a new senior secured credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of million 
the new credit facility consists of a million revolving credit facility including a million revolving letter of credit facility  a million term loan and an additional million letter of credit facility together  the new credit facility 
the revolving facility matures on december  the term loan and the million letter of credit facility matures on march  the term loan amortizes in equal quarterly installments at a rate equal to approximately per annum with all remaining amounts due on the maturity date 
the new credit facility is available for working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes 
we will be required to make mandatory prepayments under certain circumstances such as the sale of specified properties and may make certain optional prepayments under the new credit facility 
the new credit facility is guaranteed by denny s and its other subsidiaries and is secured by substantially all of the assets of denny s and its subsidiaries 
in addition  the new credit facility is secured by first priority mortgages on company owned real estate assets 
the new credit facility contains certain financial covenants ie  maximum total debt to ebitda as defined under the new credit facility ratio requirements  maximum senior secured debt to ebitda ratio requirements  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio requirements and limitations on capital expenditures  negative covenants  conditions precedent  material adverse change provisions  events of default and other terms  conditions and provisions customarily found in credit agreements for facilities and transactions of this type 
these covenants are substantially similar to those that were contained in the old credit facilities 
we were in compliance with the terms of the new credit facility as of december  interest on loans under the new revolving facility will be payable  initially  at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points and will adjust over time based on our leverage ratio 
interest on the new term loan and letter of credit facility will be payable at per annum rates equal to libor plus basis points 
the weighted average interest rate under the term loan was as of december  the weighted average interest rate under the first lien facility and the second lien facility was and  respectively  as of december  effective march   we amended the new credit facility to reduce the per annum interest rate on the term loan and letter of credit facility to libor plus basis points 
upon the event of a refinancing transaction  under certain circumstances within one year of the amendment  we would be required to pay the term loan and letter of credit facility lenders a prepayment premium in the transaction 
as a result of the prepayments noted above and the debt refinancing  we recorded million of losses on early extinguishment of debt resulting primarily from the write off of deferred financing costs 
these losses are included as a component of other nonoperating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
long term debt consists of the following at december  and december  december  december  in thousands notes and debentures senior notes due october   interest payable semi annually new credit facility revolver loans outstanding due december  term loans due march  old credit facilities first lien facility revolver loans outstanding due september  term loans due september  second lien facility other note payable  maturing january   payable in monthly installments with an interest rate of a notes payable secured by equipment  maturing over various terms up to years  payable in monthly installments with interest rates ranging from to b capital lease obligations less current maturities total long term debt a includes a note collateralized by a restaurant with a net book value of million at december  and december  b includes notes collateralized by equipment with a net book value of million at december  and december  at december   we had an outstanding term loan of million and outstanding letters of credit of million comprised of million under our letter of credit facility and million under our revolving facility 
there were no revolving loans outstanding at december  these balances result in availability of million under our letter of credit facility and million under the revolving facility 
our future contractual obligations and commitments at december  consist of the following payments due by period total less than year years years years and thereafter in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations a operating lease obligations interest obligations a pension and other defined contribution plan obligations b purchase obligations c total a interest obligations represent payments related to our long term debt outstanding at december  for long term debt with variable rates  we have used the rate applicable at december  to project interest over the periods presented in the table above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for balances and terms of the new credit facility and the notes due the notes at december  the capital lease obligation amounts above are inclusive of interest 
b pension and other defined contribution plan obligations are estimates based on facts and circumstances at december  amounts cannot currently be estimated for more than one year 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
c purchase obligations include amounts payable under purchase contracts for food and non food products 
in most cases  these agreements do not obligate us to purchase any specific volumes  and include provisions that would allow us to cancel such agreements with appropriate notice 
amounts included in the table above represent our estimate of purchase obligations during the periods presented  if we were to cancel these contracts with appropriate notice 
we would likely take delivery of goods under such circumstances 
at december   our working capital deficit was million compared with million at december  the working capital deficit decrease of million resulted primarily from a decrease in litigation reserves of approximately million and a decrease in accrued interest of approximately million due to our debt refinancing during fiscal we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations and most food service operations are conducted primarily on a cash and cash equivalent basis with a low level of accounts receivable  rapid turnover allows a limited investment in inventories  and accounts payable for food  beverages and supplies usually become due after the receipt of cash from the related sales 
off balance sheet arrangements in january  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our previous floating rate term loan debt 
we designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to payments of libor plus a fixed spread due on a related million notional debt obligation under the previous term loan facility 
under the terms of the swap  we paid a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and received payments from a counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on september  interest rate differentials paid or received under the swap agreement were recognized as adjustments to interest expense 
to the extent the swap was effective in offsetting the variability of the hedged cash flows  changes in the fair value of the swap were not included in current earnings but were reported as other comprehensive income loss 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the extinguishment of a portion of our debt on december   we discontinued hedge accounting treatment related to the interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap was sold for a cash price of million  resulting in a gain of million  which was recognized as a component of other nonoperating expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to self insurance liabilities  impairment of long lived assets  and restructuring and exit costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements self insurance liabilities 
we record liabilities for insurance claims during periods in which we have been insured under large deductible programs or have been self insured for our medical and dental claims and workers compensation  general product and automobile insurance liabilities 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence  ranges from to million per individual claim for workers compensation and for general product and automobile liability 
the liabilities for prior and current estimated incurred losses are discounted to their present value based on expected loss payment patterns determined by independent actuaries  using our actual historical payments 
these estimates include assumptions regarding claims frequency and severity as well as changes in our business environment  medical costs and the regulatory environment that could impact our overall self insurance costs 
total discounted insurance liabilities at december  and december  were million and million  respectively  reflecting a discount rate 
the related undiscounted amounts at such dates were million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the restaurant level on a quarterly basis or whenever changes or events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess impairment of restaurant level assets based on the operating cash flows of the restaurant and our plans for restaurant closings 
generally  all units with negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months at each quarter end are included in our assessment 
in performing our assessment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from similar asset sales  and other factors to determine both the recoverability and the estimated fair value of the respective assets 
if the long lived assets of a restaurant are not recoverable based upon estimated future  undiscounted cash flows  we write the assets down to their fair value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
during  and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  for underperforming restaurants  including restaurants closed 
these charges are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had a total of four restaurants with an aggregate net book value of approximately million  after taking into consideration impairment charges recorded  which had negative cash flows from operations for the most recent twelve months 
restructuring and exit costs 
as a result of changes in our organizational structure and in our portfolio of restaurants  we have recorded charges for restructuring and exit costs 
these costs consist primarily of the costs of future obligations related to closed units and severance and outplacement costs for terminated employees 
these costs are included as a component of operating gains  losses and other charges  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
discounted liabilities for future lease costs and the fair value of related subleases of closed units are recorded when the units are closed 
all other costs related to closed units are expensed as incurred 
in assessing the discounted liabilities for future costs of obligations related to closed units  we make assumptions regarding amounts of future subleases 
if these assumptions or their related estimates change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
exit costs recorded for each of the periods presented include the effect of such changes in estimates 
the most significant estimate included in our accrued exit costs liabilities relates to the timing and amount of estimated subleases 
at december   our total discounted liability for closed units was approximately million  net of million related to existing sublease agreements and million related to properties for which we expect to enter into sublease agreements in the future 
if any of the estimates noted above or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional exit costs or reduce exit costs previously recorded 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
implementation of new accounting standards effective december   the first day of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment sfas r 
this standard requires all share based compensation to be recognized in the statement of operations based on fair value and applies to all awards granted  modified  cancelled or repurchased after the effective date 
additionally  for awards outstanding as of december  for which the requisite service has not been rendered  compensation expense will be recognized as the requisite service is rendered 
the statement also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow 
we adopted this accounting treatment using the modified prospective transition method  therefore results for prior periods have not been restated 
sfas r supersedes sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas no 
 which had allowed companies to choose between expensing stock options or showing pro forma disclosure only 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and recognition of changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of the statement of financial position 
sfas is effective for recognition of the funded status of the benefit plans for fiscal years ending after december  and is effective for the measurement date provisions for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the recognition of the funded status and changes in the funded status of our benefit plans in the fourth quarter of the adoption had no impact on our consolidated balance sheet or statement of shareholders deficit 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for the first fiscal period beginning after november  we are required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material based on relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
we adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods  and expanded disclosure requirements 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements  however  we do not expect the impact to be significant 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf ratified eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of any taxes presented on a gross basis should be disclosed  if significant 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present sales net of sales taxes 
eitf does not impact the method for recording these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to certain instruments entered into for other than trading purposes 
specifically  borrowings under the term loan and revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor libor rate plus for the term loan and letter of credit facility and libor rate plus for the revolving credit facility  effective march   libor plus for the term loan and letter of credit facility 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our previous floating rate term loan debt 
we designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to payments of libor plus a fixed spread due on a related million notional debt obligation under the previous term loan facility 
under the terms of the swap  we paid a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and received payments from a counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on september  the swap effectively increased our ratio of fixed rate debt to total debt 
on december   we refinanced the old credit facilities containing the million notional amount hedged and we sold the interest rate swap 
as a result of the extinguishment of debt  we are required to discontinue hedge accounting 
the amount previously included as other comprehensive income loss was recognized as a component of other nonoperating expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  based on the levels of borrowings under the new credit facility at december   if interest rates changed by basis points our annual cash flow and income before income taxes would change by approximately million 
this computation is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the variable rate portion of the new credit facility at december  however  the nature and amount of our borrowings under the new credit facility may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
our other outstanding long term debt bears fixed rates of interest 
the estimated fair value of our fixed rate long term debt excluding capital lease obligations and revolving credit facility advances was approximately million compared with a book value of million  at december  this computation is based on market quotations for the same or similar debt issues or the estimated borrowing rates available to us 
specifically  the difference between the estimated fair value of long term debt compared with its historical cost reported in our consolidated balance sheets at december  relates primarily to market quotations for our notes 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also have exposure to interest rate risk related to our pension plan  other defined benefit plans  and self insurance liabilities 
a basis point increase in discount rate would reduce our projected benefit obligation related to our pension plan and other defined benefit plans by million and million  respectively  and reduce our net periodic benefit cost related to our pension plan by million 
a basis point decrease in discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation related to our pension plan and other defined benefit plans by million and million  respectively  and increase our net periodic benefit cost related to our pension plan by million 
the impact of a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate on periodic benefit costs related our other defined benefit plans would be less than million 
a basis point increase or decrease in discount rate related to our self insurance liabilities would result in a decrease or increase of million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase certain food products such as beef  poultry  pork  eggs and coffee  and utilities such as gas and electricity  which are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control and which are generally unpredictable 
changes in commodity prices affect us and our competitors generally and often simultaneously 
in general  we purchase food products and utilities based upon market prices established with vendors 
although many of the items purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  approximately of our purchasing arrangements are structured to contain features that minimize price volatility by establishing price ceilings and or floors 
we use these types of purchase arrangements to control costs as an alternative to using financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
we have determined that our purchasing agreements do not qualify as derivative financial instruments or contain embedded derivative instruments 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address commodity cost increases which are significant and appear to be long term in nature by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  competitive circumstances could limit such actions and  in those circumstances  increases in commodity prices could lower our margins 
because of the often short term nature of commodity pricing aberrations and our ability to change menu pricing or product delivery strategies in response to commodity price increases  we believe that the impact of commodity price risk is not significant 
we have established a policy to identify  control and manage market risks which may arise from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and other relevant rates and prices 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes
