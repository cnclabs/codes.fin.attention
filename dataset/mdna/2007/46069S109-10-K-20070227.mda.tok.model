item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
this discussion generally refers to elements within our consolidated financial statements on a pre tax basis unless otherwise stated 
except for historical information  the discussions in this section contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed below 
for further information regarding risks and uncertainties  see item a 
in this annual report on form k entitled risk factors 
overview we focus our design  manufacturing and marketing efforts on the high performance analog hpa segment of the semiconductor market 
digital and analog semiconductor components are the basic ingredient in today s electronic devices 
in contrast to the binary nature of digital components  analog components monitor  evaluate and modify electrical signals and strengths allowing them to deal with basic and essential properties such as heat  touch  light and sound 
the hpa segment is distinguished by its highly differentiated and technologically advanced products which can be building blocks for more complex circuits or highly integrated for specific applications 
historically  the hpa segment has yielded higher gross margins and suffers less competition than the digital and broader analog segments of the semiconductor market 
the hpa segment requires uniquely talented and experienced designers  engineers and specialized selling and marketing efforts to address the myriad of challenges associated with today s complex applications 
we began our transformation into an hpa company with the acquisition of elantec in and the divestiture of our wireless networking business in we further strengthened the transformation with the acquisition of xicor 
our transformation has required us to report our financial performance with restructurings  impairments  discontinued operations and write offs attendant to our acquisitions 
our first full year as a pure hpa company was fiscal since then  our focus has resulted in revenue growth that has been very broad based across our many analog products 
we have introduced hundreds of new products in each of the last few years including several new product families that have significantly expanded our served available market 
our investments to expand our product portfolio to almost product families appear to be successful  enabling us to reach our primary management goals of revenue growth with higher margins  growing operating income and increasing cash flow generation measured against the investment in the company

table of contents revenue and cost of revenue our revenue for was million  an increase of million or over this increase was driven by growth in all of our four end markets 
communication products saw the highest growth at  followed by computing products at  high end consumer products at and industrial products at 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased sales by approximately million  which was partially offset by a decline in average selling prices asps  which decreased sales by approximately million 
of this sales growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region  million from north america  and approximately million from europe 
higher sales units achieved were a function of our currently strong product offering in computing and consumer power management devices and consumer electronics 
declining sales prices has been a phenomenon of the semiconductor industry for much of its existence and is expected to continue into the foreseeable future 
our revenue for was million  an increase of million or over this increase was primarily due to a increase in high end consumer products  single digit percentage growth in computing and industrial products  and a partially offsetting decline of in our communications products 
in aggregate  higher unit demand increased sales by approximately million  which was partially offset by a decline in asps  which decreased sales by approximately million 
of this sales growth  approximately million came from our sales to customers in the asia pacific region and million from north america  which was partially offset by an approximately million sales decline to customers in europe 
we anticipate that our revenue from asia pacific region customers will continue to grow in percentage terms as that region s companies lead in the manufacture of the finished applications consumer electronics  computers  communications equipment that our products are used in 
end market demand for those applications is global and hence dependent on aggregate global economic metrics and conditions such as personal incomes and business activity and not necessarily on asian and pacific rim regional economic factors 
see business outlook elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations relating to expected revenues in the near term 
cost of revenue cost of revenues consists primarily of purchased materials and services  labor including stock based compensation  overhead and depreciation associated with manufacturing pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin improved by basis points in over compared to an increase of only basis points in over the basis point improvement was accomplished despite an increase of almost million approximately basis points of stock based compensation expense due to our adoption of sfas r in the increase in gross margin was partially due to our product mix in  as sales for our higher margin  general purpose products grew over and sales for some of our lower margin products grew over the increase in gross margins was also a function of lower wafer prices  improved yields and better pricing from our assembly and test partners in operating expenses research and development r d r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses including stock based compensation of employees engaged in product process research  design and development activities  as well as related subcontracting activities  prototype development  cost of design tools and technology license agreement expenses 
our r d expenses increased by to million in compared to million for and million for the increase of approximately million is made up of increased stock based 
table of contents compensation costs due to our adoption of sfas r in of million offset by miscellaneous other cost reductions 
our r d spending increased by in compared to due to additional r d spending associated with our acquisition of xicor in july selling  general and administrative sg a sg a expenses consist primarily of salaries and expenses including stock based compensation of employees engaged in selling and marketing our products as well as the salaries and expenses required to perform our human resources  finance  information systems  legal  executive and other administrative functions 
our sg a expenses increased by to million for compared to million for and million for the approximately million increase in compared to was made up of approximately million of additional stock based compensation costs due to our adoption of sfas r in and increased selling and marketing expenses associated with higher sales 
the increase in compared to was driven by increased selling expenses associated with higher sales and increased labor costs for a full year resulting from the acquisition of xicor during mid amortization of purchased intangibles  goodwill amortization of purchased intangibles for was million  approximately equal to that in of million 
amortization increased by to million for compared to million for the increase in compared to resulted from a full year of amortization of developed technology acquired with our purchase of xicor in july compared to only five months of amortization recognized during our purchased intangibles  which are definite lived assets  are amortized over their useful lives ranging from to years 
we review goodwill for impairment indicators quarterly and perform substantive impairment testing annually 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the value of our reporting units exceeded the goodwill value stated on our balance sheet and therefore  did not record any impairment to goodwill 
however  our goodwill value is dependent on many factors including future market demand for our products  our stock market valuation  valuation of our expected cash flow  relative values of our reporting units and many other factors 
we could have goodwill impairment in the future which would negatively impact our earnings 
in process research and development ipr d in connection with our acquisition of xicor in july  we allocated million of the purchase price to ipr d projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on risk adjusted cash flows related to the incomplete projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility and the ipr d had no alternative future uses and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as a charge to income in fiscal year by the end of fiscal  each of the projects reached some stage of commercial feasibility and were released to production 
developmental research spending ceased with commercialization and only sustaining engineering costs are currently being expended on these products 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein relating to the xicor acquisition consideration and allocation of purchase price  including that allocated to ipr d 
impairment of long lived assets during  we announced that we would move all internal volume of our micron wafer processing to an outside provider s manufacturing facility and our florida manufacturing capacity would be used to manufacture products using greater than micron proprietary processes 
in conjunction with this shift  we recorded an impairment of million million net of tax during the quarter ended april  on certain production equipment that was used to produce the micron wafers at our palm bay facility 
the impairment was calculated as the excess of the assets carrying value over their fair value as determined by the market prices of these types of assets 
these assets have been sold 
during and  we reversed and million  respectively  of the impairment on this equipment as the actual selling price of certain assets exceeded the impaired value by at least that amount 

table of contents restructurings we have formulated and completed two restructuring plans during the to time span as we executed our long term high performance analog business objectives 
the effects of these two restructurings have resulted in our estimate of approximately million in reduced annual operating costs and we believe they have streamlined our business operations and enabled measurable progress toward our business objectives 
severance related costs are expensed when incurred and substantially all of our severance agreements contain provisions for benefits upon notification of termination 
restructurings that reflect our xicor acquisition integration are described below july in july  we announced a restructuring plan to streamline our manufacturing and support functions and recorded million in restructuring expense 
approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated 
the affected positions included manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative employees 
all of the employees were located in the united states 
as of december   the affected positions had all been terminated 
march in march  we announced a restructuring plan to further streamline operations and to reduce costs 
we recorded million in restructuring expense 
approximately employees were notified that their employment would be terminated 
the affected positions included manufacturing  research and development  and selling  general and administrative employees 
as of december   the affected positions had all been terminated 
other gains losses during we recovered million for insured business interruption losses resulting from the hurricanes in during  our florida facilities were damaged by hurricanes resulting in million in reconstruction costs 
the remaining million contained in the other losses line resulted from the license agreement that the company entered into with a third party wherein we licensed sales rights that had been disputed relating to our ability to sell components for certain cellular technology applications 
other income and expenses gain on sale of certain operations in  we recorded an additional million million net of tax gain related to our sale of our discrete power product group 
this gain was the result of a reduction of accrued exit costs due to favorable contract negotiations with landlords and other vendors 
interest income  net our interest income increased to million in compared to million for and million for interest income increased in due primarily to increased interest rates earned on our investments compared to our invested cash balances in were comparable to those in available market interest rates in were higher than those in our interest income increased to million  also due primarily to higher interest rates earned on our investments compared to we net an immaterial amount of bank fees and charges against our interest income for presentation purposes 
our planned rate of increase in our stock repurchase program will reduce our financial resources available to invest in interest bearing securities in and cause a reduction in our interest income in fiscal  assuming no significant change in available interest rates 

table of contents gain loss on investments at year end  we had marketable securities that consisted of shares of a former related party s common stock that were classified as investments on the balance sheet 
they were recorded at fair value  which was determined based on quoted market prices 
as of january  we carried an unrealized gain on the investment of million  before taxes 
we held approximately of the company s shares outstanding  at january  during  we sold all of our holdings in the former related party for a realized gain of million million net of tax 
proceeds from the sale were million 
income tax expense benefit our income tax expense from continuing operations was million or of pretax income for compared to tax expense of million or of pretax income for and a tax benefit of million or of pretax income for the effective tax rate declined in primarily because of the million dividend repatriation in that did not occur in see below 
the benefit from the loss on the sale of our interest in a cost method investee was the other key driver in the tax rate decline 
our income tax expense for included a provision of million relating to our repatriation of million of foreign earnings 
see footnote in our consolidated financial statements for more information about our repatriation 
the tax benefit realized in was primarily due to a settlement of prior year income tax audits and an increase in our tax exempt interest income 
in determining net income  we must make certain estimates and judgments in the calculation of tax expense and tax liabilities and in the recoverability of deferred tax assets that arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate described above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
see footnote for our statutory to effective tax rate reconciliation for the three years ended december  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this pronouncement is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements

further  it provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition matters 
the company will adopt fin effective for its fiscal year we are still evaluating the effect fin will have on our consolidated statements of operations and consolidated balance sheets as implementation guidance is published 
discontinued operations in  we recorded an additional gain of million million net of tax primarily as a result of finalizing a contingent working capital adjustment with the buyer of our wireless networking product group  
table of contents which was sold in fiscal also  during  we reached a settlement with agere systems corporation on all pending litigations related to our wireless networking product group under mutually agreeable terms 
as part of the confidential agreement  we recorded an expense of million million net of tax 
in fiscal we settled a foreign tax liability relating to this sale  which made up the majority of our loss of million million net of tax from discontinued operations 
in fiscal we reached a settlement relating to remaining patent rights litigation connected with this sale 
after the settlement payment  the remaining accrual of million million net of tax was released and is classified and presented as discontinued operations 
backlog our sales are made pursuant to purchase orders that are booked up to six months in advance of delivery 
our standard terms and conditions of sale provide that these orders become non cancelable thirty days prior to the buyer s earliest requested delivery date for standard products and ninety days prior to our original committed delivery date for semi custom and custom products 
backlog is influenced by several factors  including market demand  pricing and customer order patterns in reaction to product lead times 
our year end backlog for was million  for it was million  and it was million 
although not always the case  we believe backlog can be an indicator of performance for approximately the next two quarters 
see business outlook 
business outlook as we announced via our fourth quarter earnings press release filed with our current report on form k  both as of january   we anticipated revenues for the first quarter to be between million and million due to inventory issues currently affecting our industry and seasonality in our consumer and computing markets 
based on this outlook  we expected earnings per diluted share of approximately to 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations as of december  in millions payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years future minimum operating lease commitments open capital asset purchase commitments open raw material purchase commitments standby letters of credit total our future minimum lease commitments consist primarily of leases for buildings and other real property 
open capital asset purchase commitments primarily include test  assembly and production equipment 
open raw material purchase commitments include purchase orders for million for externally produced wafers 
we utilize standby letters of credit primarily for security for various contracts or services such as workers compensation million  environmental items million  as well as for security for certain vendor relationships 
these standby letters of credit have annual renewals 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any guarantees that would affect our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 
we do not have any relationships with other parties that would have a material negative impact on our liquidity  cash flow or financial position 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on a variety of factors  including but not limited to  the rate of increase or decrease in our existing business base  the success  timing and amount of investment required to bring new products to market  revenue growth or decline  and potential acquisitions 
we believe that we have the financial resources necessary to meet business requirements for the next months  including our treasury share repurchase program  our dividend program  the requisite capital expenditures for the expansion or upgrading of worldwide manufacturing capacity  working capital requirements and potential future acquisitions or strategic investments 
as of december   our total shareholders equity was billion 
at that date we also had million in cash and short term securities  as well as million in long term investments 
we have no debt outstanding and believe we would be able to access debt capital of varying amounts and terms if  as and when a desire or need therefore was identified and approved by our board of directors 
our primary sources and uses of cash during the three fiscal years ended december  are presented in this summarized table fiscal years ended dec  dec  dec  millions sources of cash existing business performance and activities operating activities  including working capital changes proceeds from exercise of stock options  warrants and purchases under the employee stock purchase plan uses of cash business improvement investments business acquisitions and divestitures  net capital expenditures  net of sale proceeds returned to shareholders stock repurchases dividends paid cash investment management activities decrease increase in investments and foreign exchange effects net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents in each of the three years  our primary sources of cash have generated amounts ranging from over million to over million 
aggregately  over the three years presented above  our cash generation has been million 
we have returned a substantial amount of that cash to shareholders via our stock repurchase programs and our dividend payments  aggregately over the same three year period  million 
in we acquired xicor for a combination of cash and stock that represents a strategic growth investment to strengthen our power management products and our management 
the aim of the xicor acquisition  as with most acquisitions that we might pursue  is to increase future cash flows from operating activities 
the cash portion of the purchase price for xicor represents a significant portion of the million shown in the table above in fiscal for business acquisitions 

table of contents our aim of the company is to constantly improve the cash flows from our existing business activities against a relatively fixed investment and to return the majority of that cash flow to stockholders 
we will also continue to seek to maintain and improve our existing business performance with necessary capital expenditures and  potentially  acquisitions that may further improve our base business with prospects of a proper return 
acquisitions  should we undertake them to improve our business  might be made for either cash or stock consideration  or a combination of both 
volatility in the business environment we operate in may cause these amounts to vary from year to year 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments noted above  when combined with the lack of any outstanding long or short term debt obligations  give us the flexibility to continue to return much of our free cash flow to our stockholders while also pursuing business improvement opportunities for our future 
non cash working capital trade accounts receivable  less valuation allowances  decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease primarily reflects our increased emphasis on collection activity during since our year over year fourth quarter sales increased approximately in over inventories increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  our inventory levels reflect reduced turns in the fourth quarter of due to a further reduction in sales forecasted for our first quarter 
we believe our overall working capital investment can be managed to be relatively constant in relation to our volume of business activity measured by sales revenues and unit volumes for the foreseeable future 
our standard trade receivable terms range from net to net days 
from time to time  management has made exceptions to these standard terms for various business and competitive reasons and extended the terms up to days 
capital expenditures capital expenditures were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal in our expenditures focused on continuing our capacity expansion in test and packing equipment  in our expenditures focused on test packaging equipment and expenditures related to preparing for our campus consolidation in florida 
proceeds from exercises of stock options and our stock purchase plan in we enjoyed increased cash flow from stock plans exercises of stock options and sales under our espp 
at more than million for the fiscal year  cash collected from such exercises exceeded the million sum of the prior two years 
while the level of such cash inflow to us in future periods is subject to certain market forces we don t control  we believe that such proceeds will remain an important secondary source of cash  after operating cash flow  in fiscal stock repurchases and dividends we currently have in effect an active stock repurchase program and  announced in february  a per share dividend for the first quarter of fiscal both programs represent our major effort to return our operating cash flow to our shareholders and we currently intend to continue both programs for the foreseeable future 
transactions with related and certain other parties former related party intersil had a contract in place with a former related party  which expired in mid year fiscal  under which they provided a specified percentage of intersil s test and package services 
the terms of the contract were the result of arms length negotiations and  in the opinion of management  were no less favorable than those that could be obtained from non affiliated parties 
at the time the contract was entered into  the companies shared a common board member and intersil once held an equity position in the company 
although the company continues to procure a portion of its test and package services from this firm  it utilizes other vendors for these services as well 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have included our more subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimates  in addition to the inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimates  and the possible effects on our financial condition 
the six accounting estimation processes discussed below are the allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  distributor  oem and warranty allowances  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill accounting for income taxes  and fair value of stock based compensation these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create changes  including adverse ones  to our statement of operations and financial position 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
allowance for collection losses on trade receivables  or receivables allowance december  in millions december  in millions gross trade receivables receivables allowance other allowances net trade receivables our receivables allowance is used to state trade receivables at a net realizable value or the amount that we estimate will be collected on our gross receivables 
since the amount that we will actually collect on the receivables outstanding cannot be known until the future  we rely primarily on prior experience 
our historical collection losses have been typically infrequent with write offs of trade receivables being well below of sales 
in order to allow for future collection losses that arise from customer accounts that do not indicate the inability to pay but will have such an inability  we maintain an allowance based on a month rolling average of write offs  which as of december  equaled of our gross trade receivables balance 
we also maintain specific allowances for customer accounts that we know may not be collectible due to various reasons  such as bankruptcy and other customer liquidity issues 
we analyze our trade receivable portfolio based on the age of each customer s invoice 
in this way  we can identify the accounts that are more likely to have collection problems 
we then provide an allowance for a portion or all of the customer s balance 
distributor  oem and warranty allowances  or other allowances shown in the immediately foregoing table relating to receivables allowance as other allowances  are our allowances for various eventual customer credits 
this is a combination of distributor  original electronic manufacturer oem and warranty allowances 
distributor allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
revenue is recognized from sales to all other customers  excluding north american distributors  when a product is shipped 
sales to international distributors are made under agreements  which provide the distributors certain price protection on a percentage of unsold inventories they hold 
accordingly  distributor allowances are amounts within our trade receivable allowance section of the balance sheet that estimate the amount of price adjustments that will be encountered in the future on the inventory that is held by international distributors as of the balance sheet date 
as the amount of inventory 
table of contents held by international distributors that will be adjusted in the future cannot be known with certainty as of the date hereof  we rely primarily on historical international distributor transactions 
the international distributor allowances comprise two components that are reasonably estimable 
the first component of international distributor allowances is the price protection allowance  which protects the distributors gross margins in the event of falling prices which are common in semiconductors and other electronic components 
this allowance is based on the relationship of historical credits issued to distributors in relation to historical inventory levels and the price paid by the distributor as applied to current inventory levels 
the second component is a stock rotation allowance  which is based on the percentage of sales made to limited international distributors whereby the distributors can periodically receive a credit for unsold inventory they hold 
specific allowances for our oem customers  of which various types of returns are the largest component  totaled million at december   warranty allowances  returns for which there are product performance claims  totaled million as of december  allowances for excess or obsolete inventory  or inventory allowances we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market as described in the footnotes to the financial statements 
as the ultimate market value that we will recoup through sales on our inventory can not be known with exact certainty as of the date of this filing  we rely on past sales experience and future sales forecasts to project it 
in analyzing our inventory levels  we classify certain inventory as either excess or obsolete 
these classifications are maintained for all classes of inventory  although due to the commonality between our products  raw materials are seldom deemed excess or obsolete 
we classify inventory as obsolete if we have withdrawn it from the marketplace or if we have had no sales of the product for the past months and no sales forecasted for the next months 
we provide an allowance for of the standard cost of obsolete inventory 
it is our policy to scrap obsolete inventory 
reviews are conducted of excess inventory on a monthly basis 
we classify inventory as excess if we have quantities of product greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months 
we typically retain excess inventory until the inventory is sold or reclassified as obsolete 
we provide an allowance for approximately to of the standard cost of the excess inventory 
we believe that this allowance represents the portion we will not be able to recover when we attempt to sell this inventory due to our new product next generation introductions and other technological advancements 
for all items identified as excess or obsolete during the process described above  management reviews the individual facts and circumstances ie competitive landscape  industry economic conditions  product lifecycles and product cannibalization specific to that inventory 
inventory allowances totaled approximately million on gross inventory of million at december  and million on gross inventory of million at december  product demand estimates are a key element in determining inventory allowances 
our estimate of product demand requires significant judgment and is based in part on historical revenue 
historical sales may not accurately predict future demand 
if future demand is ultimately lower than our estimate  we could incur significant additional expenses to provide allowances for and scrap obsolete inventory 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill pursuant to our adoption of sfas in  we completed an initial impairment review of our goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives and found no impairment 
according to our accounting policy  we also perform an annual review during the fourth quarter of each subsequent year  and have found no impairment in any period to date 
we will perform a similar review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
goodwill is tested under the two step method for impairment at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit 
at december  we have five reporting units for purposes of this analysis 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to identify potential impairment  compares the calculated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no impairment of the goodwill of the reporting unit is indicated and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test will be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the purpose of which is to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill 
table of contents with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after a goodwill impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill will be its new accounting basis 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on goodwill since adopting sfas accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions  and significant judgment is required to determine worldwide income tax liabilities 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
our effective tax rate as well as the actual taxes ultimately payable could be adversely affected by changes in the split of earnings between countries with differing statutory tax rates  in the valuation of deferred tax assets  in tax laws or by material audit assessments  which could affect our profitability 
the aforementioned temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our net deferred tax asset amounted to million compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to the usage of net operating loss carryforwards nol s arising out of the xicor acquisition and research credit carryforwards 
fair value of stock based compensation under sfas r  the fair value of the grant compensation cost is calculated by us on the date of grant using the lattice method except for cost relating to grants made prior to the fourth quarter of for which we used the black scholes model 
the compensation cost is then amortized straight line over the period relating to service conditions vesting period 
generally  the lattice method will  all other computational inputs being equal  result in a lesser fair value per share than will the black scholes method 
additionally  however  it is generally believed that the lattice method is more appropriate for employee stock options that have longer terms and lack of marketability that is not well recognized by the black scholes method 
we adopted the lattice method when software was acquired that permitted the calculation and when it became clear that it would be acceptable under the pronouncement that later came to be known as sfas r 
calculating fair value requires us to estimate certain key assumptions in the valuation model 
these are expected stock price volatility  the expected risk free interest rate in the market  and expected forfeitures of options by employees due their termination before vesting is fully earned 
volatility is one of the most significant determinants of fair value 
our expected volatility is estimated from a blend of estimated price movement activity implied by our traded options and the actual historic volatility of our stock price 
our expected risk free interest rate is estimated by using the zero coupon us treasury rate at the time of the grant related to the expected term of the grant 
expected forfeitures must be estimated to reduce the gross calculation of fair value to an amount expected to be recorded in the financial statements 
we estimate forfeitures for the first year of vesting  based on historical information about turnover for the appropriate employee level 
thereafter  as vesting tiers within an option are more frequent until fully vested  the actual forfeiture or lack thereof determines the appropriate amount to be recorded in the financial statements 
calculating fair value for our options and deferred stock units that have a performance measurement element to them also requires us to estimate the likely actual performance before the performance is complete 
we do this by adjusting the forfeiture rate to include the expectation of actual performance at the time the 
table of contents calculation is made for purposes of amortizing the compensation appropriately 
such performance based instruments  depending upon the term of required performance  may need to be remeasured as frequently as quarterly 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information with regard to our performance based grants 
these estimates of key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding future expectations and are re examined on a regular basis 
when such re examinations of the key assumptions lead to significant changes to the calculation inputs  it can have a material affect on the amount of stock based compensation that will be recognized in aggregate or in any period 
this may mean more volatility in our reported earnings due to changed facts and circumstances surrounding the company s use of stock compensation

table of contents the company has filed two current reports on form k subsequent to its year ended december  the first  dated january   disclosed the operating results for the company s fourth fiscal quarter and full fiscal year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we  in the normal course of doing business  are exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments  entered into for purposes other than trading purposes  to manage our exposure to these risks 
the company s cash equivalents and short term investments are subject to two market risks credit risk and interest rate risk 
since a substantial majority of the sum of cash equivalents and short term investments are held in the form of auction rate securities with frequent rate resets see also notes and in our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein this annual report on form k and money market investments  we believe there is no material interest rate risk 
our interest income will therefore be more volatile and vary with short term rates more than if we had a larger commitment to long term investments 
our long term investments are subject to both interest rate risk and credit risk 
since our long term securities portfolio at december  was made up entirely of federal agency securities  we believe the credit risk is very low 
with regard to interest rate risk on our long term securities portfolio  we believe a point increase in long term rates basis points would result in a theoretical million unrealized loss on our approximately million portfolio at that date 
since our long term investments are classified as held to maturity  such a theoretical unrealized loss would not be recorded unless the investment was sold 
at december   we had open foreign exchange contracts with a notional amount of approximately million  which was to hedge forecasted foreign cash flow commitments up to six months 
as our hedges on forecasted foreign cash flow commitments do not qualify for deferral  gains and losses on changes in the fair market value of the foreign exchange contracts are recognized in income 
there was no net gain or loss on foreign exchange contracts for during  we purchased and sold million of foreign exchange forward contracts 
the derivatives were also recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value  which was immaterial  at december  the table below summarizes our foreign exchange contract activity over the past two years in millions fiscal year ended december  december  gain on foreign exchange contracts purchases and sales of foreign exchange contracts notional amount of open contracts at year end fair value of open contracts at year end our hedging activities provide only limited protection against currency exchange risks 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of our hedging programs include accuracy of sales estimates  volatility of currency markets and the cost and availability of hedging instruments 
a adverse change in currency exchange rates for our foreign currency derivatives held at december  will have a negligible impact on the fair values of these instruments 
this qualification of exposure to the market risk associated with foreign exchange financial instruments does not take into account the offsetting impact of changes in the fair values of foreign denominated assets  liabilities and firm commitments 
see also note in our consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein this annual report on form k 
a substantial majority of our revenues billed outside the us are billed and collected in us dollars 
therefore we do not believe we have material risk to revenues due to currency rate fluctuations between billing and collection of funds for those amounts billed in other currencies
