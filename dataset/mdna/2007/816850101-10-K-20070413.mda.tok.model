item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
as discussed in forward looking and cautionary statements earlier in this report  this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements  including as a result of the risks described in the cautionary statements in item a risk factors and elsewhere in this form k  in our other filings with the sec  and in material incorporated herein and therein by reference 
we undertake no duty to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
management s discussion and analysis set forth below reflects the restatement of prior year financial statements as described in the explanatory note 
as a result  the information set forth in this item may not be comparable to discussions and data in our previously filed reports 
financial statements and the related reports of our independent public accountants  earnings press releases  and similar communications issued prior to july  should no longer be relied upon and have been superseded by the information contained in the form k a  our quarterly reports on form q for the quarterly periods ended april   july   and october  which were filed concurrently with the form k a  and in reports filed with the sec subsequent to the filing of the form k a 
review of stock option practices in light of an informal inquiry from the sec in may  management undertook an internal review of the company s historical stock option practices and a special committee of independent directors was established to conduct a separate investigation 
these assessments extended back to the start of fiscal year and determined that certain stock options granted or modified primarily during fiscal years to were not properly accounted for under us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  generally due to the use of incorrect accounting measurement dates 
the pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense resulting from the revised measurement dates and other adjustments restatement adjustments made to correct the accounting was approximately million in the aggregate for fiscal years through  net of forfeitures related to employee terminations the net of tax amount is approximately million 
the additional non cash compensation expense was amortized over the required service period  generally over the vesting periods of the respective grants 
in march we filed an amendment form k a to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended january  to reflect the additional non cash stock based compensation expense 
the form k a includes a restatement of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the three years ended january  and selected consolidated financial data for the five years ended january   the cumulative after tax adjustment for fiscal years through is included in the restated fiscal year balance sheet as a reduction in stockholders equity 
the restatement adjustments had no impact on revenues  on net cash provided by operating activities  on investing or financing cash flows  or on the company s total cash balances 
see the form k a for detailed information about the restatement  its underlying circumstances  and associated matters 
the incorrect stock option accounting described above has an immaterial impact on fiscal year and future years  although we have incurred  and will continue to incur  significant accounting  consulting and legal fees related to the restatement and associated matters such as government inquiries and litigation 
these expenses are expected to be significant for some time 
in fiscal year we recognized million of expense related to the compensation of optionees who were prohibited from exercising expiring or lapsing stock options during the restatement process and we may incur significant expense with respect to this item in the future from other optionees

table of contents overview we design  develop and market a broad range of products that are sold principally to customers in the computer  consumer product  communications and industrial markets for a wide variety of end applications 
computer end market applications include notebook and desktop computers  computer graphics  and personal digital assistants pdas 
products within the communications market include products for set top boxes  local area networks  metro and wide area networks  cellular phones and base stations 
industrial and other applications include automated test equipment ate  power supplies  hearing aids and other medical devices  and meter reading and factory automation systems 
our end customers are primarily original equipment manufacturers and their suppliers  including apple  cisco  compal electronics  dell  hewlett packard  ibm  intel  lg electronics  motorola  nortel  phonak  quanta computer  samsung  siemens  and sony 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
product design and engineering revenue is recognized during the period in which services are performed 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of certain products to distributors where return privileges exist until the products are sold through to end users 
gross profit is equal to our net sales less our cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes materials  depreciation on fixed assets used in the manufacturing process  shipping costs  direct labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
our operating costs and expenses generally consist of selling  general and administrative sg a  product development and engineering costs r d  costs associated with acquisitions  and other operating related charges 
most of our sales to customers are made on the basis of individual customer purchase orders 
many customers include liberal cancellation provisions in their purchase orders 
trends within the industry toward shorter lead times and just in time deliveries have resulted in our reduced ability to predict future shipments 
as a result  we rely on orders received and shipped within the same quarter for a significant portion of our sales 
sales made directly to customers during fiscal year were of net sales 
the remaining of net sales were made through independent distributors 
we divide and operate our business based on two reportable segments standard semiconductor products and rectifier  assembly and other products 
we evaluate segment performance based on net sales and operating income of each segment 
we do not track segment data or evaluate segment performance on additional financial information 
we do not track balance sheet items by individual reportable segments 
as such  there are no separately identifiable segment assets nor are there any separately identifiable statements of income data below operating income 
the standard semiconductor products segment makes up the vast majority of overall sales and includes our power management  protection  test and measurement  and advanced communications and sensing ac s product lines 
it also includes the small human interface device hid product line  which we are exiting 
the rectifier  assembly and other products segment includes our line of power discrete products  such as assembly and rectifier devices 
this is the product line on which we were founded to supply the military and aerospace market 
our business involves reliance on foreign based entities 
most of our outside subcontractors and suppliers  including third party foundries that supply silicon wafers  are located in foreign countries  including china  taiwan  malaysia  korea  the philippines  germany  israel and canada 
for the fiscal year ended january   approximately of our silicon  in terms of cost of wafers purchased  was manufactured in china 
foreign sales for fiscal year constituted approximately of our net sales 
approximately of foreign sales in fiscal year were to customers located in the asia pacific region 
the remaining foreign sales were primarily to customers in europe  canada  and mexico 
acquisition on june   we acquired through our wholly owned swiss subsidiary  semtech international ag  all of the outstanding shares of xemics sa xemics in a cash for stock transaction pursuant to a share purchase and sales agreement 
following the acquisition we changed the name of the company from xemics sa to semtech neuchatel sa semtech neuchatel 
semtech neuchatel is a research and development intensive company based in switzerland that applies low power  low voltage design expertise across its core technologies  namely sensor interfacing data acquisition  bit risc 
table of contents microcontrollers  radio frequency transceivers and audio converters 
these capabilities are aimed at adding value in next generation  highly integrated battery powered wireless and sensing applications 
semtech neuchatel  which continues to operate from its switzerland location  is part of our advanced communication and sensing ac s product line and is included in the standard semiconductor products segment 
in addition to the million we paid to the selling shareholders of xemics in june  the acquisition contract provided for the possibility of additional payments of up to million if semtech neuchatel met certain performance objectives during an earn out period of approximately one year that ended on april  the objectives were not met during the earn out period and no purchase price adjustment is payable to the selling shareholders 
the former xemics shareholders made certain representations  warranties and covenants with respect to the financial condition of xemics and other matters 
a portion of the purchase price was not immediately disbursed to the selling shareholders but was held in escrow for fifteen months after the closing to ensure the availability of some funds in the event liability attached to the selling shareholders as a result of a breach of the representations and warranties 
this fifteen month escrow period ended in september no claims were made against this escrow account and the escrowed funds were released to the selling shareholders 
however  six of the selling shareholders continue to remain liable for five years after the closing as to certain representations related to organization  capital structure  and tax matters 
the share purchase and sales agreement provides for certain conditions and limitations on the selling shareholders liability 
we continue to monitor and assess whether there are any qualifying items in excess of the threshold for making a claim against the six selling shareholders 
any successful claim will be accrued as a reduction of the cost of the acquisition 
consistent with purchase accounting treatment of the acquisition  we included xemics results of operations subsequent to the close of the transaction on june  in our consolidated results of operations 
we also assumed the assets and liabilities of xemics as of the closing date 
during the second quarter of fiscal year a one time acquisition related charge to earnings of million was recorded for the write off of in process research and development 
from the close date of june  until the end of our fiscal year on january   we incurred  of expense for amortization of other intangible items 
the remaining million balance of other intangible items as of end the end of fiscal year will be amortized over future periods 
the amount amortized in fiscal year was million 
there are no tax related benefits from these acquisition related costs 
additional information regarding the acquisition is provided in this item under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates and in note to the financial statements included in this report 
insurance settlements in march  we announced that we resolved a customer dispute 
the terms of the settlement agreement included a provision that called for us to pay the customer million in cash 
at the time of the customer settlement  we stated that we would vigorously pursue insurance coverage for the full value of the settlement 
we subsequently filed lawsuits against three of our insurance companies and reached settlements with two of the three insurance companies in the second quarter of fiscal year we recorded a million gain in fiscal year for these insurance settlements 
in fiscal year  we also recorded million of related legal expenses under the operating expense category of selling  general and administrative 
the case against the remaining insurance company is still pending but no trial date has been set 
we are unable to predict if settlement will be reached prior to trial 
there is no assurance that we will prevail at trial or that the insurance company will not appeal if we do prevail 
the insurance recoveries and related legal fees and expenses for fiscal years  and are set forth on the consolidated statements of income as a separate line item titled insurance related legal expenses 
legal fees and expenses related to pursuit of the insurance recovery have been  and will continue to be  expensed in the period incurred 
if the settlement amount or amount awarded at trial is less than we seek  if we fail to prevail at trial  or if we or the insurance company appeal the decision  total legal expenses associated with the litigation since its inception may exceed the amount recovered from the insurance companies 

table of contents additional information regarding the insurance settlements is provided in note to the financial statements included in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate and discuss with our audit committee our estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  inventory reserves  asset impairments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
our critical accounting policies and estimates do not vary between our two reportable segments 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements accounting for temporary and long term investments our temporary and long term investments consist of government  bank and corporate obligations 
temporary investments mature within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
long term investments have maturities in excess of one year from the date of the balance sheet 
we classify our investments as available for sale because we expect to possibly sell some securities prior to maturity 
we include any unrealized gain or loss  net of tax  in the comprehensive income portion of our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the net receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment  the size and number of certain large accounts and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we defer revenue recognition on shipment of products to certain customers  principally distributors  where return privileges exist until these products are sold through to end users or the return privilege lapses 
the estimated deferred gross margin on these sales  where there are no outstanding receivables  are recorded on the balance sheet under the heading of deferred revenue 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
we base these estimates on historical sales returns and other known factors 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
inventory valuation our inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and consist of materials  labor and overhead 
we determine the cost of inventory by the first in  first out method 
at each balance sheet date  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of 
table of contents future demand 
in order to state our inventory at lower of cost or market  we maintain reserves against our inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  a write down of inventory may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
contingencies and litigation we are involved in various disputes and litigation matters as a claimant and as defendant 
we record any amounts recovered in these matters when collection is certain 
we record liabilities for claims against us when the losses are probable and estimable 
any amounts recorded are based on reviews by outside counsel  in house counsel and management 
actual results may differ from estimates 
stock based compensation in fiscal years through  we included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements a pro forma disclosure of the impact stock options would have on net income loss using the fair value stock option expense recognition method  as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
and using an intrinsic value method  as prescribed by accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
a revised standard  sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all companies to measure compensation cost for all share based payments including stock options at fair value  is effective beginning with a company s first interim or annual reporting period of the first fiscal year beginning on or after june  this means sfas r is effective for us beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year  which began on january  the adoption of sfas r requires us to apply a valuation model  which includes estimates and assumptions on the rate of forfeiture and expected life of options and stock price volatility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the adoption of sfas r 
if any of the assumptions used in the valuation model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period and actual results may differ from estimates 
goodwill and intangible assets the company accounts for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill is recorded at the time of an acquisition and is calculated as the difference between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
if the assumptions and estimates used to allocate the purchase price are not correct  or if business conditions change  purchase price adjustments or future asset impairment charges could be required 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas  the company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if the company believes indicators of impairment exist 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i any future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii a significant slowdown in the worldwide economy and the semiconductor industry or iv any failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets  including purchased intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we primarily use the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of the assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the 
table of contents discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analysis  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges in a future period 
the company accounts for other purchased intangible assets  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment  such as reductions in demand or significant economic slowdowns in the semiconductor industry  are present 
reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset is impaired  based on comparisons to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if this comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to fair value  which is typically calculated using i quoted market prices and or ii discounted expected future cash flows utilizing a discount rate consistent with the guidance provided in fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
impairment is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets 
in process research and development related to acquisition of xemics in june in process research and development ipr d expense totaled million during fiscal year the amount allocated to ipr d was determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and was expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying project had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  as clarified by fin no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
to business combinations accounted for by the purchase method  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 amounts assigned to ipr d meeting the above stated criteria were charged to expense as part of the allocation of the purchase price 
the fair value of the acquired ipr d was determined using the income approach 
under this approach  the expected future cash flows for the project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development were considered 
future cash flows were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  market penetration and growth rates 
the following table summarizes the key assumptions of the acquired ipr d project as of the acquisition date development project wireless sensing chips and protocols average estimated percent complete average estimated time to complete years estimated cost to complete in millions risk adjusted discount rate ipr d in millions as of the acquisition date  the cost to complete development was estimated to be million and revenue related to the acquired ipr d was projected to begin in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of a shift in strategic market positioning  r d priorities were revised and related resources were reallocated 
this shift resulted in the cancellation of some development activities and a reduced allocation of development resources to others  resulting in a delay in projected release to market of certain ipr d related products 
revenue related to the acquired ipr d is now projected to begin late in fiscal year the shift in priorities is expected to reduce cash flow from ipr d related projects by approximately million over the next three years which will be partially offset by reduced development costs related to the cancelled development activities 
the assumptions consist primarily of expected completion dates  estimated cost to complete  and revenue and expense projections for the product once it enters the market 

table of contents accounting for income taxes the sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated condensed financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
generally  to the extent we change the valuation allowance in a period  the change is recorded through the tax provision in the statement of operations 
if a valuation allowance relates to benefits from stock option exercise activity  any adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded to paid in capital in the period of the adjustment 
any release of a valuation allowance established against a pre acquisition xemics net operating loss carryforward will be recorded to goodwill 
management continually evaluates our deferred tax assets to assess whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax impact is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
we maintain a contingency reserve of million to reflect this exposure 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
in addition to the risks to the effective tax rate discussed above  the effective tax rate reflected in forward looking statements is based on current enacted tax law 
significant changes in enacted tax law could materially affect these estimates 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales 
net sales for fiscal year were million  an increase of from million for fiscal year included in net sales for fiscal year and were million and million  respectively  of incremental sales as a result of the june acquisition of xemics 
semiconductor and electronics industry conditions weakened in the second half of fiscal year compared to the first half of fiscal year fiscal year was characterized by a strong second half  but a weaker first half of fiscal year our quarterly sales levels reflected these periods of strength and weakness

sales in the communications category were most impacted by a decline in sales of products used in cellular handsets 
sales in networking and communications infrastructure applications were relatively flat 
the increase in the industrial end market category reflected a increase in sales into the automated test equipment ate market and a increase in other industrial other applications primarily as a result of a full year of sales related to the june xemics acquisition  which contributed only eight months of sales to fiscal year 
standard semiconductor products represented of net sales in fiscal year  with the rectifier  assembly and other products segment contributing the remaining

production volumes were impacted by the overall slowdown in the semiconductor market in the second half of fiscal year and also by the decline in our power management business 
our strategy is to develop new products that offer more advanced or more complex features than the competition  which in turn generally provides for higher gross margin 
however  margin improvements may be offset by price erosion due to competition and other factors tied to industry conditions

in order to develop  design and manufacture new products  we have incurred significant expenditures during the past five years 
we expect to continue these investments aimed at developing new products  including the hiring of many design and applications engineers and related purchase of equipment 
our intent is to continue to invest in those areas that have shown potential for viable and profitable market opportunities 
certain of these expenditures  particularly the addition of design engineers  do not generate significant payback in the short term 
we plan to finance these expenditures with cash generated by operations and investments 
a meaningful portion of our capital resources  and the related liquidity they represent  are held by our foreign subsidiaries 
as of january   approximately million of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were held in switzerland  compared to million held in switzerland as of january  if we needed these funds for investment in domestic operations  any repatriation could have negative tax implications 
for all periods presented  the purchases of new capital equipment were made to expand our test capacity  support other engineering functions  including product design and qualification and information technology equipment needed to run our business 
these purchases were funded from our operating cash flows and cash reserves 
we believe that operating cash flows together with cash reserves are sufficient to fund operations and capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as those arrangements are defined by the sec  that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources

they are not recorded as liabilities on our balance sheet as of january   as we have not yet received the related goods or taken title to the property 
we maintain a deferred compensation plan for certain officers and key executives that allows participants to defer a portion of their compensation for future distribution at various times permitted by the plan 
we match a portion of the employee s deferral  with the match subject to a vesting period 
charges under this plan in fiscal year were approximately  however  we also received a credit of approximately  in fiscal year as a result of previously accrued compensation expense under this plan that was forfeited as a result of termination of certain plan participants  resulting in a net expense for fiscal year of approximately  compensation expense under this plan totaled  in fiscal year and  in fiscal year our liability for deferred compensation under this plan was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other long term liabilities on the balance sheet and in the table above

the cash surrender value of our company owned life insurance was million as of january  and million as of january   and is included in other assets 
inflation inflationary factors have not had a significant effect on our performance over the past several years

recently issued accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter the amendments made by sfas no 
clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges and require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the pronouncement is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years after november  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on our financial condition  the results of operations or liquidity in fiscal year on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which supersedes apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee 
table of contents stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
the provisions of sfas r are effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and we adopted it beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year  which began on january  we adopted the new standard using the modified prospective transition method 
the impact of adopting this pronouncement is discussed in note  under the heading stock based compensation in our notes to financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin provides detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions upon its initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
we will adopt fin effective for our fiscal year  which began on january  we are still evaluating the potential impact of adopting this pronouncement but expect  based on currently available guidance  that the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operation or liquidity 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas no 
applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except statement no 
r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
it is expected to expand the use of fair value measurements which is consistent with the financial accounting standards board s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas is effective for our first fiscal year that begins after november   which is our fiscal year that begins in january we are evaluating the effect that adoption of this pronouncement might have on our consolidated financial condition  results of operation or liquidity to determine whether to electively adopt its provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of market risks  such as the foreign exchange and interest rate risks that are detailed below 
many of the factors that can impact on our market risk are external to the company  and so we are unable to fully predict them 
foreign currency risk as a global enterprise  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and we could experience currency gains or losses 
because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure  we generally do not use forward contracts to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
our foreign currency exposures may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the non us dollar denominated 
table of contents currencies are principally the euro  swiss francs and british pounds sterling 
additionally  certain of our current and long term liabilities are denominated principally in british pounds sterling currency  which is also sensitive to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
substantially all of our foreign sales  which amounted to million in fiscal year  are denominated in united states dollars 
currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business could harm our business by resulting in pricing that is not competitive with prices denominated in local currencies 
for the fiscal year ended january   we had approximately million of expenses that were settled in british pound sterling  approximately million of expenses that were settled in swiss francs  million of expenses that were settled in euros and million of expenses that were settled in mexican pesos 
had rates of these various foreign currencies been higher relative to the us dollar in fiscal year  our costs would have increased approximately  related to expenses settled in british pound sterling  approximately  related to expenses settled in swiss francs   related to expenses settled in euros and  related to expenses settled in mexican pesos 
as of the end of fiscal year  we held as part of cash and cash equivalents million of british pound sterling  million of swiss francs   of euros and  of mexican pesos 
if rates of these foreign currencies were to move higher or lower by some percentage  it would have equal effect on the relative us dollar value of the balances we hold 
in fiscal year  we entered into a forward contract to purchase million swiss francs in fiscal year in exchange for million 
the forward contract was entered into as a partial hedge against future tax payments in swiss francs and shortly after maturity was used to help settle such tax liabilities 
as of january  we had no foreign exchange hedge contracts in place 
interest rate and market risk as of january   we had no long term debt outstanding 
we do not currently hedge any potential interest rate exposure 
interest rates affect our return on excess cash and investments 
as of january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of temporary and long term investments 
a majority of our cash and cash equivalents and investments generate interest income based on prevailing interest rates 
investments and cash and cash equivalents generated interest income of million in fiscal year a significant change in interest rates would impact the amount of interest income generated from our excess cash and investments 
it would also impact the market value of our investments 
as of january   we estimate that our pool of investments had an effective duration of day weighted average days to maturity  which implies that a increase in the prevailing interest rate could result in approximately million of additional unrealized loss on our investments 
our investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by us 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality and maturity and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with relatively short term maturities
