item business general overview and history varian  inc  together with its subsidiaries collectively  the company  designs  develops  manufactures  markets  sells and services scientific instruments including related software  consumable products  accessories and services and vacuum products and related accessories and services 
for financial reporting purposes  our operations are grouped into two corresponding segments scientific instruments and vacuum technologies 
these segments  their products and the applications in which they are used are described below 
varian  inc became a separate  public company on april  until that date  our business was operated as the instruments business of varian associates  inc vai 
the instruments business which 
table of contents included the business units that designed  developed  manufactured  marketed  sold and serviced scientific instruments and vacuum technologies  and a business unit that provided contract electronics manufacturing services was contributed by vai to us 
on that date  vai distributed to holders of its common stock one share of our common stock and one share of common stock of varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc vsea  which was formerly operated as the semiconductor equipment business of vai  for each share of vai common stock outstanding on april  the distribution 
vai retained its health care systems business and changed its name to varian medical systems  inc vms 
these transactions were accomplished under the terms of an amended and restated distribution agreement dated as of january  by and among us  vai and vsea the distribution agreement 
until march   we operated an electronics manufacturing business the electronics manufacturing business  which was a contract manufacturer of electronic assemblies and subsystems such as printed circuit boards for original equipment manufacturers oems 
on that date  the electronics manufacturing business was sold to jabil circuit  inc as a result  our former electronics manufacturing business has been treated as a discontinued operation throughout this annual report on form k and is therefore excluded from all disclosures pertaining to our continuing operations

table of contents marketing and sales we market and sell most of our products through our own direct sales organizations  although a few products and services are marketed and sold through independent sales representatives and distributors 
in certain countries and for certain products and services  sales are made through various sales representative and distributor arrangements 
to support this marketing and sales structure  we have sales and service offices in numerous locations around the world 
we compete for the most part on a global basis 
sales outside of north america accounted for  and of sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
as a result  our customers increasingly require service and support on a worldwide basis 
we have sales and service offices located throughout north america  europe  asia pacific and latin america 
we have invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of our customers worldwide 
demand for our products depends on many factors  including the level of capital expenditures of our customers  the rate of economic growth in our major markets and competitive considerations 
no single customer accounted for or more of our sales in fiscal year  or we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in the first fiscal quarter october to december 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many government and research related customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including the timing of revenue recognition on large systems  general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr  mr imaging and ftms systems and superconducting magnets 
we believe that we differentiate our products from those of our competitors by our responsiveness to customer requirements  as determined through market research 
although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications  customers generally demand superior performance  ease of use  high quality  high productivity and low cost of ownership 
we have responded to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets we serve 
backlog our recorded backlog was million at september   million at september  and million at september  the decrease in backlog from september  to september  was primarily due to a net reduction in unfulfilled orders for mr imaging systems and to a lesser extent for vacuum products 
these decreases were partially offset by strong order volume for analytical instruments and to a lesser extent the impact of the weaker us dollar on orders denominated in other currencies 
for the period from september  to september   backlog increased primarily due to stronger order volume in our scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments 
in particular  increased orders for mr imaging systems  newer analytical instruments and vacuum products  as well as acquisitions made during fiscal year  drove the increase in backlog 
we include in backlog purchase orders or production releases under blanket purchase orders that have firm delivery dates 
recorded backlog in us dollars is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  recorded backlog might not result in sales because of cancellations or other factors 
most of our products are shipped soon after they are ordered by customers  with the time between order receipt and shipment being as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
however  other products  in particular certain magnet based products  can have significantly longer lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
significant shipments often occur in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how customers place orders and schedule shipments 

table of contents we believe that approximately of orders included in our backlog at september  will result in revenue before the end of fiscal year competition competition in markets we serve is primarily based upon the performance capabilities of products  technical support and after market service  the manufacturer s reputation as a technological leader and product pricing 
we believe that performance capabilities are the most important of these criteria 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive and are characterized by the application of advanced technology 
there are numerous companies that specialize in  and a number of larger companies that devote a significant portion of their resources to  the development  manufacture  sale and service of products that compete with those that we manufacture  sell or service 
many of our competitors are well known manufacturers with a high degree of technical proficiency 
in addition  competition is intensified by the ever changing nature of the technologies in the industries in which we are engaged 
the markets for our products are characterized by specialized manufacturers that often have strength in narrow segments of these markets 
while the absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to determine our relative market position in our industry segments  we are one of the principal manufacturers in our primary fields 
we compete with many companies 
our scientific instruments segment competes primarily with agilent  bruker  jeol  perkinelmer  shimadzu  thermo fisher scientific  waters and other smaller suppliers 
our vacuum technologies segment competes primarily with adixen alcatel  edwards  inficon  oerlikon leybold  pfeiffer  ulvac and other smaller suppliers 
manufacturing our principal manufacturing activities consist of precision assembly  test  calibration and certain specialized machining activities 
for most of our products  we subcontract a portion of the assembly and machining  but perform all other assembly  test and calibration functions 
we believe that the ability to manufacture reliable products in a cost effective manner is critical to meeting the just in time delivery and other demanding requirements of our oem and end user customers 
we monitor and analyze product lead times  warranty data  process yields  supplier performance  field data on mean time between failures  inventory turns  repair response times and other indicators so that we can continuously improve our manufacturing processes 
as of september   we operated significant manufacturing facilities located throughout the world 
our scientific instruments segment had manufacturing facilities in palo alto  california  walnut creek  california  lake forest  california  ft 
collins  colorado  randolph  massachusetts  cary  north carolina  melbourne  australia  grenoble  france  middelburg  netherlands  church stretton  united kingdom  and yarnton  united kingdom 
our vacuum technologies segment had manufacturing facilities in lexington  massachusetts  and turin  italy 
all of our significant manufacturing facilities have been certified as complying with the international organization for standardization series quality standards iso 
raw materials our manufacturing operations require a wide variety of raw materials  electronic and mechanical components  chemical and biochemical materials and other supplies  some of which are occasionally in short supply 
in addition  use of certain of our products requires reliable and cost effective supply of certain raw materials 
for example  end users of our magnet based products require helium to operate those products 
helium can be  and at various times has been  difficult to source and is becoming more expensive 
if we or our customers cannot obtain sufficient quantities of helium  it could prevent us from shipping and installing superconducting magnets  which could result in our inability to recognize revenues on magnet based products 
in addition  shortages of helium could result in even higher helium prices  and thus higher operating costs for magnet based products  which could impact demand for those products 

table of contents changes in the availability or price of certain other key raw materials or components could increase our costs or our customers costs to acquire and operate our products  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we manufacture some components used in our products 
other components  including certain consumables materials and electronic components and subassemblies  are purchased from other manufacturers 
most of the raw materials  components and supplies we purchase are available from a number of different suppliers  however  a number of items such as wire used in superconducting magnets and electronic subassemblies used in scientific instruments are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipment of our products or increases in our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
research and development we are actively engaged in basic and applied research  development and engineering programs designed to develop new products and to improve existing products 
during fiscal years  and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research  development and engineering activities 
over this period  the focus of our research and development activities has been shifting more toward information rich detection and consumable products 
we intend to continue to conduct extensive research and development activities  with a continued emphasis on information rich detection products such as magnet based products  mass spectrometers including vacuum products for use in oem mass spectrometers and certain consumable products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and market new products on a cost effective and timely basis  that such products will compete favorably with products developed by others or that our existing technology will not be superseded by new discoveries or developments 
customer service and support we believe that our customer service and support are an integral part of our competitive strategy 
as part of our support services  our applications and technical support staff provides individual assistance in supporting customers specific applications needs  solving analysis problems and integrating vacuum components 
we offer training courses and periodically send our customers information on applications development 
our products generally include a day to one year warranty  but in some countries and for some products we offer longer warranties 
service contracts may be purchased by customers to cover equipment no longer under warranty 
service work not performed under warranty or service contract is generally performed on a time and materials basis 
we install and service our products primarily through our own field service organization  although certain distributors and sales representatives are able and contracted to perform some field services 
patent and other intellectual property rights we have a policy of seeking patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection in the us and other countries for developments  improvements and inventions originating within our organization that are incorporated in our products or that fall within our fields of interest 
as of september   we owned over patents in the us and over patents in other countries  and had numerous patent applications on file with various patent agencies worldwide 
we intend to continue to file patent applications as we deem appropriate 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trade secret and other legal  as well as contractual  restrictions on disclosure  copying and transferring title to protect our proprietary rights 
we have trademarks  both registered and unregistered  that are maintained and enforced to provide customer recognition for our products in the marketplace 
we also have agreements with third parties that provide for licensing of patented or proprietary technology 
these agreements frequently include royalty bearing licenses and technology cross licenses 

table of contents environmental matters our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the us  as well as laws in other countries  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  our compliance with these regulations is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
for additional information on environmental matters  see item a risk factors environmental matters and governmental regulations 
employees at september   we had approximately  full time and temporary employees and contract workers worldwide approximately  in north america   in europe  in asia pacific and in latin america

item a 
risk factors customer demand 
demand for our products depends upon  among other factors  the level of capital expenditures by current and prospective customers  the rate of economic growth in the markets in which we compete  the level of government funding for research and the competitiveness of our products and services 
changes in any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we must continue to assess and predict customer needs  regulatory requirements and evolving technologies 
we must develop new products  including enhancements to existing products  new services and new applications  successfully commercialize  manufacture  market and sell these products and protect 
table of contents our intellectual property in these products 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
variability of operating results 
we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in our first fiscal quarter october to december 
sales and earnings in our third fiscal quarter are usually flat to down sequentially compared to the second fiscal quarter  primarily because there are a number of holidays in the early part of the quarter  especially in europe  and the june quarter end has no significant customer year ends to influence orders 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many government and research related customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including the timing of revenue recognition on large systems  general economic conditions  acquisitions  new product introductions and products requiring long manufacturing and installation lead times such as nmr  mr imaging and ftms systems and superconducting magnets 
consequently  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
for most of our products  we operate on a short backlog  as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
we also make significant shipments in the last few weeks of each quarter  in part because of how our customers place orders and schedule shipments 
this can make it difficult for us to forecast our results of operations 
certain of our magnet based products including nmr  mr imaging and ftms systems  nmr probes  superconducting magnets and other related components sell on long lead times  sometimes in excess of one year 
certain of these systems and components sell for high prices  are complex  require development of new technologies and  therefore  significant research and development resources  are often intended for evolving research applications  often have customer specific features  capabilities and acceptance criteria  and can be difficult to manufacture and require long lead times 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  all of these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the gross profit on these products 
changes in our effective tax rate can also create variability in our operating results 
our effective tax rate can be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries having lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries having higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets or liabilities or by changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense 
should actual events or results differ from our current expectations  charges against or credits to our income tax reserves and expense may become necessary 
any such adjustments could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
all of this can make it difficult for us to forecast our effective tax rate 
competition 
the industries in which we operate are highly competitive 
we compete against numerous companies  both us and non us  most with global operations 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have  which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  achieve economies of scale and other cost reductions  compete on price  or devote greater resources to research and development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales or managerial activities 
others have greater name recognition and geographic and market presence or lower cost structures than we do 
in addition  weaker demand and excess capacity in our industries could cause greater price competition as our competitors seek to maintain sales volumes and market share 
for the foregoing reasons  competition could result in lower revenues due to lost sales or price reductions  lower margins and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
although no single customer accounted for or more of our sales in fiscal year  we do have important customers the loss of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents new product development 
technological innovation and new product development are important to maintain the competitive position of our products and to grow our sales and profit margins 
we have historically dedicated a significant portion of our resources to research and development efforts as a means of generating new products and improving existing products  and intend to continue to conduct extensive research and development activities  with an emphasis on information rich detection products such as magnet based products  mass spectrometers including vacuum products for use in mass spectrometers and certain consumable products 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to improve existing products and or develop new products on a cost effective and timely basis  that such products will compete favorably with products developed by others or that our existing technology will not be superseded by new discoveries or developments 
if we fail to improve existing products and or develop new products  we could experience lower revenues and or lower profit margins  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key suppliers and raw materials 
some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products  including wire used in superconducting magnets and electronic subassemblies used in scientific instruments  are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
disruption of these sources could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increases in our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the manufacturing and or use of certain of our products require raw materials for which supply and price can fluctuate significantly 
for example  end users of our magnet based products require helium to operate those products 
helium can be  and at various times has been  difficult to source and is becoming more expensive 
if we or our customers cannot obtain sufficient quantities of helium  it could prevent us from shipping and installing superconducting magnets  which could result in our inability to recognize revenues on magnet based products 
in addition  shortages of helium could result in even higher helium prices and thus higher operating costs for magnet based products  which could impact demand for those products 
changes in the availability or price of certain other key raw materials or components could increase our costs or our customers costs to acquire and operate our products  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
business interruption 
our facilities  operations and systems could be impacted by fire  flood  terrorism or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  we have significant facilities in areas prone to earthquakes and fires  such as our production facilities and headquarters in california 
due to their limited availability  broad exclusions and prohibitive costs  we do not have insurance policies that would cover losses resulting from an earthquake 
if any of our facilities or surrounding areas were to be significantly damaged in an earthquake  fire  flood or other disaster  it could disrupt our operations  delay shipments and cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our employees based in certain countries outside of the us are subject to factory specific and or industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
of these  certain of our employees in australia are subject to collective bargaining agreements that will need to be renewed in april a work stoppage  strike or other labor action at this or other of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property 
our success depends on our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and licensing arrangements to establish and protect that intellectual property  but these protections might not be available in all countries  might not be enforceable  might not fully protect our intellectual property and might not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
moreover  we might be required to spend significant resources to police and enforce our intellectual property rights  and we might not detect infringements of those intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other third parties might claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights that we are infringing 
any litigation regarding intellectual property 
table of contents of others could be costly and could divert personnel and resources from our operations 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to develop non infringing alternatives or enter into royalty bearing license agreements 
we might also be required to pay damages or be enjoined from developing  manufacturing or selling infringing products 
we sometimes rely on licenses to avoid these risks  but we cannot be assured that these licenses will be available in the future or on favorable terms 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions 
we have acquired companies and operations and made minority equity investments in private companies  and intend to acquire companies and operations and make minority equity investments in private companies in the future  as part of our growth strategy 
these acquisitions must be carefully evaluated and negotiated if they are to be successful 
once completed  acquired operations must be carefully integrated to realize expected synergies  efficiencies and financial results 
some of the challenges in doing this include retaining key employees  managing operations in new geographic areas  retaining key customers  integrating data systems  assessing and if necessary implementing or improving internal control over financial reporting and managing transaction costs 
all of this must be done without diverting management and other resources from other operations and activities 
additionally  acquisition related goodwill and minority equity investments in private companies are subject to regular impairment testing and potential impairment charges 
for all of these reasons  failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate and integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities 
we have undertaken restructuring activities such as our northern california facilities consolidation and other efficiency improvement activities such as our global procurement initiative  and have announced and may undertake similar activities in the future  that we expect to result in certain costs and eventual cost savings 
these costs and cost savings are based on estimates at the time of plan commitment as to the timing of activities to be completed and the timing and amount of related costs to be incurred 
we could experience delays  business disruptions and employee turnover in connection with restructuring and other efficiency improvement activities and our estimates of the costs to complete and savings achieved by these activities could change 
as a result  these activities could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
non us operations and currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our manufacturing activities  customers  suppliers and employees are outside of the us as a result  we are subject to various risks  including the following duties  tariffs and taxes  restrictions on currency conversions  fund transfers or profit repatriations  import  export and other trade restrictions  protective labor regulations and union contracts  compliance with local laws and regulations  as well as us laws and regulations such as the foreign corrupt practices act as they relate to our non us operations  travel and transportation difficulties  and adverse developments in political or economic environments in countries where we operate 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the us dollar value of our sales and operating costs varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because we manufacture and sell in the us and a number of other countries  the impact that currency exchange rate fluctuations have on us is dependent on the interaction of a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the relationships between various foreign currencies  the relative amount of our revenues that are denominated in us dollars or in us dollar linked currencies  customer resistance to currency driven price changes and the suddenness and severity of changes in certain foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge most of our balance sheet exposures denominated in other than local currencies based upon forecasts of those exposures  in the event that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  foreign exchange losses could result 
for all of these reasons  currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key personnel 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel  including research and development  engineering  manufacturing  finance  administrative  marketing  sales and management personnel 
the availability of qualified personnel and the cost to attract  motivate and retain them can vary significantly based on factors such as the strength of the general economy 
however  even in weak economic periods  there is still intense competition for personnel with certain expertise in the geographic areas where we compete for personnel 
in addition  certain employees have significant 
table of contents institutional and proprietary technical knowledge  which could be difficult to quickly replace 
failure to attract  motivate and retain qualified personnel  who generally do not have employment agreements or post employment non competition agreements  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
certain employee benefit plans 
many of our us employees and some of our us retirees participate in health care plans under which we are self insured 
we maintain a stop loss insurance policy that covers the cost of certain individually large claims under these plans 
during each year  our expenses under these plans are recorded based on actuarial estimates of the number and costs of expected claims  administrative costs  and stop loss premiums 
these estimates are then adjusted at the end of each plan year to reflect actual costs incurred 
actual costs under these plans are subject to variability depending primarily upon participant enrollment and demographics  the actual number and costs of claims made and whether and how much the stop loss insurance we purchase covers the cost of these claims 
in the event that our cost estimates differ from actual costs  our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
we also maintain defined benefit pension plans for our employees in several countries outside of the us in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  we utilize a number of assumptions including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine our defined benefit pension plan costs each year 
these assumptions are set based on relevant debt  equity and other market conditions in the countries in which the plans are maintained 
we adjust these assumptions each year in response to corresponding changes in the underlying market conditions 
changes in these market conditions result in corresponding changes in our defined benefit pension plan assumptions  liabilities and costs 
in addition  changes in relevant government regulations in the countries in which our defined benefit pension plans are located and or changes in the accounting rules applicable to these plans including sfas could also impact our defined benefit pension plan liabilities and costs 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters 
our operations are subject to various federal  state and local laws in the us  as well as laws in other countries  regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate that our compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
as is described in item business  we are obligated under the terms of the distribution agreement to indemnify vms for one third of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to environmental matters 
in that regard  vms has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  at ten sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment or disposal 
in addition  vms is overseeing and  as applicable  reimbursing third parties for environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation activities  in most cases under the direction of  or in consultation with  federal  state and or local agencies in the us  at certain current vms or former vai facilities 
we are obligated to indemnify vms for one third of these environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and taxes 
for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further environmental related activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
as of september   it was nonetheless estimated that our share of the future exposure for environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging from one year up to years as of september  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range  and we therefore had an accrual of million as of september  
table of contents as to certain sites and facilities  sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate the scope and certain costs of future environmental related activities 
as of september   it was estimated that our share of the future exposure for these environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging from two years up to years as of september  as to each of these sites and facilities  it was determined that a particular amount within the range of certain estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental related cost than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
together  the undiscounted amounts for these sites totaled million at september  we therefore had an accrual of million as of september   which represents the best estimate of our share of these future environmental related costs discounted at  net of inflation 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph 
at september   our reserve for environmental related costs  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by us as of that date  was calculated as follows recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the foregoing amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation  monitoring and remediation activities are being undertaken 
an insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of certain of vai s now vms future environmental related costs for which we have an indemnification obligation  and we therefore have a long term receivable of million discounted at  net of inflation in other assets as of september  for our share of such recovery 
we have not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recoveries from third parties 
management believes that our reserves for the foregoing and other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of our obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified  and related charges against or credits to earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to our financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  management believes that the costs of environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents governmental regulations 
our businesses are subject to many governmental regulations in the us and other countries  including with respect to protection of the environment  employee health and safety  labor matters  product safety  medical devices  import  export  competition and sales to governmental entities 
these regulations are complex and change frequently 
we incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations  costs to comply with new or changed regulations could be significant  and failure to comply could result in suspension of or restrictions on our operations  product recalls  fines  other civil and criminal penalties  private party litigation and damage to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the european union eu adopted directive ec on waste electrical and electronic equipment the weee directive 
the weee directive requires eu member countries to adopt implementing legislation imposing certain responsibilities on producers manufacturers and importers in the eu of electrical and electronic equipment with respect to the collection and disposal of waste from that equipment 
certain requirements of the weee directive took effect in august  in particular the requirement that each eu member country adopt legislation implementing the weee directive in that country 
all eu member countries where we manufacture or import products have adopted such implementing legislation although in some cases to be effective at a future date 
we are incurring or will incur waste collection and disposal costs to comply with implementing legislation under the weee directive 
these costs have not been significant to date and we do not expect them to be significant in the future  but if they are  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  similar legislation has been or could be enacted in other countries outside the eu  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the eu also adopted directive ec on restriction on the certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment the rohs directive 
the rohs directive bans in the eu the use of certain hazardous materials in electrical and electronic equipment 
the rohs directive took effect on july   the date by which each eu member country was required to adopt legislation implementing the directive in that country 
all eu member countries where we manufacture or import products have adopted such implementing legislation 
as a result of the rohs directive  certain raw materials and components sourced from third parties are no longer available  or will in the future become unavailable  for use in the manufacture of the company s products 
we have not experienced significant supply disruptions and have not incurred significant costs as a result of the rohs directive and we do not expect such disruptions or costs to be significant in the future  but if they are  our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  similar legislation has been or could be enacted in other countries outside the eu such as china and or the scope of the rohs directive could be expanded by the eu or eu member countries  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year segment results for financial reporting purposes  our continuing operations are grouped into two business segments scientific instruments and vacuum technologies 
the following table presents comparisons of our sales and operating earnings for each of those segments and in total for fiscal years and fiscal year ended september  september  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total company operating earnings by segment scientific instruments vacuum technologies total segments general corporate total company scientific instruments 
the increase in scientific instruments sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volume  in particular from mass spectrometers and other analytical instruments 
sales into industrial which includes environmental  food and energy applications increased strongly  while sales into life science applications increased modestly 
scientific instruments revenues for the fiscal year do not include sales for the full period from pl international limited polymer labs  which was acquired in november excluding the impact of polymer labs  scientific instruments sales in fiscal year increased by approximately compared to fiscal year scientific instruments operating earnings for fiscal year include restructuring and other related costs of million  acquisition related intangible amortization of million  share based compensation expense of million and amortization of million related to inventory written up in connection with the acquisition of ionspec corporation ionspec in february in comparison  scientific instruments operating earnings for fiscal year include restructuring and other related costs of million  an in process research and development charge of million relating to the acquisition of polymer labs  acquisition related intangible amortization of million  share based compensation expense of million and amortization of million related to inventory written up in connection with the acquisitions of magnex scientific limited magnex in november  polymer labs in november and ionspec in february excluding the impact of these items  the increase in operating earnings as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from sales volume leverage and efficiency improvements benefiting selling  general and administrative expenses as well as the transition to internally sourced magnets for magnet based products

vacuum technologies sales increased primarily as a result of higher sales volume of products for life science applications 
vacuum technologies operating earnings for fiscal years and include the impact of share based compensation expense of million in both periods 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in operating earnings as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to the impact of sales volume leverage on research and development expenses and  to a lesser extent  selling  general and administrative expenses

as discussed under the heading segment results above  sales by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments in fiscal year increased by and  respectively  compared to fiscal year on a consolidated basis  sales grew in fiscal year  with strong growth into industrial which includes environmental  food and energy applications and modest growth into life science applications 
revenues for fiscal year do not include sales for the full twelve months from polymer labs  which was acquired in november excluding the impact of polymer labs  sales in fiscal year increased by approximately compared to fiscal year sales by geographic region in fiscal years and were as follows fiscal year ended september  september  increase decrease of sales of sales dollars in millions sales by geographic region north america europe asia pacific latin america total company 
table of contents the increases in sales in europe  asia pacific and latin america were primarily attributable to stronger demand across a broad range of our products  in particular analytical instruments and vacuum products 
the weaker us dollar also had a positive effect on the reported sales increases in these regions 
in europe  higher sales of magnet based products also contributed to the increase 
we believe the reduction in sales in north america was primarily due to a general trend in many industries of manufacturing moving out of the us for cost and tax reasons  which was in part due to consolidations and a shift in pharmaceutical research and manufacturing to the asia pacific region 
while this trend negatively impacted sales in north america in fiscal year  it probably benefited us in asia pacific 
in addition to the factors described above  the sales decrease in north america and increase in europe compared to fiscal year were both more pronounced  and the sales increase in asia pacific was less pronounced  due to the timing of sales of certain low volume  high selling price magnet based products 
we do not consider these geographic shifts to be indicative of any particular trend for magnet based products as a whole  but rather to be reflective of the variability in results that these low volume  high selling price magnet based products can create

in comparison  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year included million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
excluding the impact of these items  selling  general and administrative expenses were lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal year primarily as a result of sales volume leverage and efficiency improvements resulting from cost reduction activities 
research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal year reflect the impact of million in restructuring and other related costs and million in share based compensation expense 
in comparison  research and development expenses for fiscal year reflect the impact of share based compensation expense of million 
excluding the impact of these items  research and development expenses were slightly lower as a percentage of sales due to sales volume leverage 
in absolute dollars  the increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from the acquisitions of polymer labs in the first quarter of fiscal year and ionspec in the second quarter of fiscal year and higher spending on new product development primarily for information rich detection products 
restructuring activities 
between fiscal years and  we committed to several restructuring plans in order to adjust our organizational structure  improve operational efficiencies and eliminate redundant or excess costs resulting from acquisitions or dispositions during those periods 
we have incurred a total of million in restructuring expense under these restructuring plans 

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in our aggregate liability relating to all restructuring plans during fiscal year employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  in addition  we have also recorded other costs related directly to these plans comprised primarily of employee retention and relocation costs and accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed upon the closure of facilities totaling million 
of this amount  a total of million was recorded during fiscal year fiscal year plan 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we committed to a plan to combine and optimize the development and assembly of most of our nuclear magnetic resonance nmr and mass spectrometry products  to further centralize related administration and other functions and to reallocate certain resources toward more rapidly growing product lines and geographies 
as part of the plan  we are creating an information rich detection ird center in walnut creek  california  where certain nmr operations currently located in palo alto  california will be integrated with mass spectrometry operations already located in walnut creek 
merging our ird talent base into this single location will capitalize on our strength in nmr and mass spectrometry  and enhance our ability to develop innovative ird solutions that are more powerful  complementary  routine and user friendly 
underscoring our commitment to ird and the benefits that a combined location and organization will provide  we will invest in a new  square foot building and a substantial remodel of an existing building there to house the ird center 
as a result of the plan  a number of employee positions have been or will be relocated or eliminated and certain facilities will be consolidated 
these actions primarily impact the scientific instruments segment and involve the elimination of between approximately and positions 
we expect these activities to be completed during the first half of fiscal year restructuring and other related costs associated with this plan include one time termination benefits  retention payments  costs to relocate facilities including decommissioning costs  moving costs and temporary facility storage costs  accelerated depreciation of fixed assets to be disposed as a result of facilities actions and lease termination costs 
these costs are currently estimated to be between million and million  of which million was incurred in fiscal year and between million and million is expected to be recorded in fiscal year these costs are expected to be settled through the second quarter of fiscal year except for certain lease termination related costs  which might be settled as late as the fourth quarter of fiscal year costs relating to restructuring activities recorded under this plan have been included in cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability relating to the foregoing plan during fiscal year employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  
table of contents the restructuring charges of million recorded during fiscal year related to employee termination benefits 
in addition  we incurred million in other costs relating directly to this restructuring plan during fiscal year these costs were comprised of a million non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of assets to be disposed upon the closure of facilities as well as million in employee retention costs and million in other facility related costs  both of which will be settled in cash 
since the inception of this plan  we have recorded million in related restructuring expense and million of other related costs 
upon its completion  the plan is expected to result in certain operational improvements and efficiencies  which we anticipate will result in a reduction of our overall cost structure and annual operating expenses 
we currently estimate the annual cost savings to be achieved following completion of this plan to be between million and million per year 
these estimated cost savings  which are not expected to be realized until the plan is substantially completed in the first half of fiscal year  are expected to impact cost of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development 
some of these cost savings have been and will continue to be reinvested in other parts of our business  for example  as part of our continued emphasis on information rich detection and consumable products 
in addition  unrelated cost increases in other areas of our operations have and could in the future offset some or all of these cost savings 
although it is difficult to quantify with any precision our actual cost savings to date from these activities  many of which are still ongoing  we currently believe that the ultimate savings realized will not differ materially from these estimates 
interest income 
the increase in interest income was primarily due to higher average invested cash balances and higher rates of interest on those balances during fiscal year compared to fiscal year income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the lower effective income tax rate in fiscal year was primarily due to a net reduction of million in tax reserves resulting from the positive outcome of tax uncertainties during that period  partially offset by the negative impact of a million non deductible in process research and development charge recorded during the same period 
we currently expect our effective income tax rate to be between and for the full fiscal year net earnings 
net earnings for fiscal year reflect the impact of million in share based compensation expense  million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in restructuring and other related costs and million in amortization related to inventory written up in connection with recent acquisitions 
net earnings for fiscal year reflect the impact of million in share based compensation expense  million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in amortization related to inventory written up in connection with recent acquisitions  million in restructuring and other related costs and an in process research and development charge of million 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in net earnings in fiscal year resulted primarily from higher sales volume and lower selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year sale of electronics manufacturing business and discontinued operations 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  we sold the business formerly operated as our electronics manufacturing segment to jabil circuit  inc in connection with the sale  we determined that this business should be accounted for as discontinued operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
consequently  the results of operations of the electronics manufacturing business have been excluded from our results from continuing operations for fiscal year and have instead been presented on a discontinued operations basis 
earnings from discontinued operations are discussed separately below

the increase in scientific instruments sales was primarily attributable to higher sales volume of magnetic resonance mr imaging systems  mass spectrometers and other analytical instruments for industrial applications and  to a lesser extent  life science applications 
sales into the environmental  energy and mining industries were particularly strong in fiscal year the increase was partially offset by lower sales of high field nmr systems

excluding the impact of these items  the increase in operating earnings as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from sales volume leverage and a mix shift toward higher margin products including mass spectrometers and mr imaging systems and away from lower margin high field nmr systems 
vacuum technologies 
the increase in vacuum technologies sales was driven by higher sales volume of products  particularly turbomolecular pumps  for both life science and industrial applications 
vacuum technologies operating earnings for fiscal year include the impact of share based compensation expense of million as a result of our adoption of sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal year excluding the impact of this amount  the increase in vacuum technologies operating earnings as a percentage of sales was primarily attributable to sales volume leverage  increased sales of higher margin products particularly turbomolecular pumps  and reduced costs from the consolidation of and process improvements in the segment s vacuum pump exchange operations  which positively impacted the segment s operating profit percentage by approximately basis points

in comparison  gross profit for fiscal year reflects the impact of million in amortization expense relating to acquisition related intangible assets and million in amortization expense related to inventory written up in connection with the magnex acquisition 
excluding the impact of these items  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased primarily as a result of sales volume leverage  a mix shift towards higher margin products including mass spectrometers  mr imaging systems and turbomolecular pumps and away from lower margin high field nmr systems 
in addition  reduced costs resulting from the consolidation of and process improvements in the pump exchange operations in our vacuum technologies segment positively impacted the gross margin percentage by approximately basis points 
selling  general and administrative

in comparison  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal year reflect the impact of million in restructuring and other related costs  million in acquisition related intangible amortization and a loss of million relating to the settlement of a defined benefit pension plan 
excluding the impact of these items  selling  general and administrative expenses were slightly higher as a percentage of sales as a result of higher order based commissions and transition costs related to recent acquisitions in the scientific instruments segment 
this was partially offset by sales volume leverage and lower costs of complying with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which were of sales for fiscal year  compared to of sales for fiscal year which was our initial year of implementation 
research and development 
research and development expenses for fiscal year reflect the impact of share based compensation expense of million 
excluding this item  research and development expenses were relatively flat as a percentage of sales between the periods 
the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars was primarily due to the acquisitions of polymer labs and ionspec as well as higher spending on new product development for primarily information rich detection products 
restructuring activities 
fiscal year plans 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to rationalize our scientific instruments field support administration in the united kingdom following the completion of our acquisition of magnex 
these actions were undertaken to achieve operational efficiencies and eliminate redundant costs resulting from the acquisition which involved the termination of approximately employees  the consolidation of certain field support administrative functions previously located in our walton  united kingdom location to magnex s location in yarnton  united kingdom and the closure of the walton facility 
costs relating to restructuring activities recorded under this plan have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  
table of contents we incurred million in other costs relating directly to this restructuring plan during fiscal year this amount was comprised of employee relocation and retention costs  which were settled in cash 
from the inception of this plan through september   we recorded million in related restructuring expense and million of other related costs 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we committed to a separate plan to reorganize  consolidate and eliminate certain activities 
this plan was undertaken due to the divestiture of our electronics manufacturing business  the result of which was that we had lower revenues and reduced infrastructure requirements after the divestiture 
we determined that this required us to adjust our organization and reduce our cost structure 
costs relating to restructuring activities recorded under this plan were included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
under this plan  certain administrative functions within our corporate organization and scientific instruments segment were reorganized and consolidated 
this involved changes in reporting structures  consolidation of certain activities and the elimination of employee positions 
in addition  this plan involved the elimination of employee positions in certain other operations to reduce our cost structure 
these activities were completed during fiscal year the measures described above resulted in the elimination of a total of approximately employee positions  of which approximately were in north america and approximately were in europe 
the costs associated with this plan consisted of one time termination benefits and other related costs for employees in the corporate organization and the scientific instruments segment whose positions were eliminated 
the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  charges to expense cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  from the inception of this plan through september   we recorded million in related restructuring expense and million of other related costs 
fiscal year plan 
during fiscal year  we undertook certain restructuring actions to improve efficiency and more closely align employee skill sets and other resources with our evolving product mix as a result of our continued emphasis on nmr  mass spectroscopy and consumable products  with a bias toward life science applications 
in addition  actions were undertaken to create a more efficient consumable products operation 
these actions primarily impacted the scientific instruments segment and involved the termination of approximately employees principally in sales and marketing  administration  service and manufacturing functions  the closure of three sales offices and the consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
substantially all of these activities were completed during fiscal year except for the termination of approximately employees  which took place in the second and third quarters of fiscal year and the southern california facility consolidation  which was initiated in the third quarter of fiscal year and was substantially completed in the first quarter of fiscal year costs relating to restructuring activities recorded under this plan have been included in selling  general and administrative expenses 

table of contents the following table sets forth changes in our restructuring liability during fiscal year in connection with this plan employee related facilities related total in thousands balance at september  reversals cash payments foreign currency impacts and other adjustments balance at september  the non cash portion of restructuring costs recorded in connection with these restructuring actions was not significant  either in the aggregate or for any single fiscal period 
from the inception of this plan through september   we recorded million in related restructuring expense and million in other related costs 
interest income 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal year reflects the impact of net cash received from the sale of the electronics manufacturing business and subsequently used to repurchase stock during fiscal year  partially offset by some increase in interest rates on invested cash in fiscal year income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year these effective income tax rates were impacted by in process research and development charges of million and million  respectively 
in addition  the effective income tax rate for fiscal year included two separate discrete  one time events that resulted in reductions of income tax expense during the period 
the first discrete tax item  which resulted from a change in the treatment of foreign tax credits under new us law enacted during the period  reduced income tax expense by approximately million 
the second discrete item  which resulted from the elimination of withholding tax on certain dividends under a new tax law enacted in switzerland during the period  reduced income tax expense by approximately million 
excluding the impact of these items  the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was lower than the rate for fiscal year primarily due to lower state taxes resulting from favorable tax elections and a larger benefit from the positive outcome of tax uncertainties during fiscal year  which were partially offset by lower realization of foreign tax credits during the period 
earnings from continuing operations 
earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year reflect the after tax impact of million in share based compensation expense  million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in amortization related to inventory written up in connection with recent acquisitions  an in process research and development charge of million and million in restructuring and other related costs 
earnings from continuing operations for fiscal year reflect the after tax impact of million in acquisition related intangible amortization  million in amortization related to inventory written up in connection with recent acquisitions  an in process research and development charge of million  restructuring and other related costs of million  a settlement loss of million relating to a defined benefit pension plan in australia and a reduction in income tax expense of million relating to discrete  one time tax events during the period 
excluding the impact of these items  the increase in earnings from continuing operations resulted primarily from higher sales volume and improved gross profit margins due to sales volume leverage and a mix shift toward higher margin products 
earnings from discontinued operations 
earnings from discontinued operations for fiscal year include earnings of million net of tax generated from the operations of the disposed electronics manufacturing business in that period prior to its sale as well as the one time book gain of million net of tax on the sale transaction 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to exercise certain judgments in selecting and applying accounting policies and methods 
the following is a summary of what we consider to be our most critical accounting policies those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments the effects of those accounting policies applied and the judgments made in their application 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from product sales including accessory sales and services 
we recognize revenue on product sales and accessory sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product or accessory has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
our sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
product sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  but that do involve installation services  are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing holdback or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and subsequently recognized when the installation is complete 
for certain other product sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is deferred until all contractually required customer acceptance provisions and product specifications have been satisfied 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
revenue related to incident based paid service and training services is recognized when the related services are provided to the customer 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer 
sales arrangements involving undelivered elements are primarily confined to the scientific instruments segment and involve product accessories  installation services and or training services that are delivered after the related product has been delivered 
product accessories generally enhance the functionality of the product but are not essential to the functionality of the product 
in determining relative fair values for product accessories and training services  we utilize published price list values as the basis for allocating the overall arrangement consideration 
list prices are representative of fair value  as stand alone sales of products  product accessories and training have occurred at list price 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
estimates of installation hours have historically been accurate 
in limited cases  product accessories ordered by customers may not have an established list price  as the item may be a new or slightly modified accessory with no prior sales history 
in these limited cases  we consider whether a comparable or substitute accessory that provides similar functionality exists for which fair value has been established and then use that comparable or substitute accessory s list price in estimating the fair value of the undelivered elements 
if such conditions do not exist  all arrangement revenue is deferred until the undelivered element is delivered  however  such cases are infrequent and arise from a significant technological advance that creates products or product accessories without a suitable comparable or substitute accessory from which to derive fair value 
we determine when and how much revenue may be recognized on a particular transaction in a particular period based on our best estimates of the fair value of undelivered elements and our judgment of when our performance obligations have been met as outlined above 
these judgments and estimates impact reported revenues 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we sell our products and extend trade credit to a large number of customers 
these customers are dispersed across many different industries and geographies and  historically  no single customer has accounted for or more of our total revenues or trade accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral from them 
although bad debt write offs have historically been insignificant  allowances are established for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible 
these allowances represent our best 
table of contents estimates and are based on our judgment after considering a number of factors including third party credit reports  actual payment history  customer specific financial information and broader market and economic trends and conditions 
in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from these best estimates  changes in allowances for doubtful accounts might become necessary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being computed on an average cost basis 
provisions are made to write down potentially excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories to their net realizable value 
these provisions are based on our best estimates after considering historical demand  projected future demand including current backlog  inventory purchase commitments  industry and market trends and conditions and other factors 
in the event that actual excess  obsolete or slow moving inventories differ from these best estimates  increases to inventory reserves might become necessary 
product warranty 
our products are generally subject to warranties and liabilities are therefore established for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement through charges to cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized 
these liabilities are adjusted based on our best estimates of future warranty costs after considering historical and projected product failure rates and product repair costs 
in the event that actual experience differs from these best estimates  changes in our warranty liabilities might become necessary 
environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully in item business and item a risk factors environmental matters  we entered into a distribution agreement in connection with becoming a separate  public company on april  under the terms of that distribution agreement  we are obligated to indemnify varian medical systems  inc vms for one third of certain environmental investigation  monitoring and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
the liabilities recorded by us relating to these matters are based on our best estimates after considering currently available information regarding the cost and timing of remediation efforts  related legal matters  insurance recoveries and other environmental related events 
as additional information becomes available  these amounts are adjusted accordingly 
should the cost or timing of remediation efforts  legal matters  insurance recoveries or other environmental related events including any which may be currently unidentified differ from our current expectations and best estimates  changes to our reserves for environmental matters might become necessary 
share based compensation 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal year sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards including employee stock options and shares issued under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
under sfas r  we estimate the value of share based payments on the date of grant using the black scholes model  which was also used previously for the purpose of providing pro forma financial information as required under sfas the determination of the fair value of  and the timing of expense relating to  share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of variables including the expected term of awards  expected stock price volatility and expected forfeitures 
prior to the first quarter of fiscal year  we used historical stock price volatility in preparing our pro forma information under sfas under sfas r  we use a combination of historical and implied volatility to establish the expected volatility assumption based upon our assessment that such information is more reflective of current market conditions and a better indicator of expected future volatility 
sfas r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate expected forfeitures  as well as the expected term of awards  based on historical experience 
future changes in these assumptions  our stock price or certain other factors could result in changes in our share based compensation expense in future periods 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous jurisdictions outside of the us significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our income tax expense 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on our best estimates of whether and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established 
table of contents when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
these reserves are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances 
our income tax expense includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
should the ultimate resolution of any tax related uncertainties including any which may be currently unidentified differ from our current expectations  charges against or credits to our income tax reserves and expense will become necessary 
liquidity and capital resources we generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year  compared to million generated in fiscal year the increase in cash from operating activities was primarily driven by higher net earnings in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the increase was also attributable to a relative increase of million in cash from changes in assets and liabilities excluding the effect of acquisitions 
the relative increase in cash from changes in assets and liabilities was primarily due to relative increases in cash from accounts receivable million  inventories million and other liabilities million 
the relative increase from accounts receivable was primarily due to improved collections in fiscal year the relative increase from inventories was primarily due to a greater increase in inventories in the prior year as a result of our transition to internally sourced magnets for our magnet based products and the timing of new product launches 
the relative increase from other liabilities was primarily due to an increase in our long term liabilities relating to certain defined benefit postretirement plans 
the increase in cash flows from operations attributable to the foregoing factors was partially offset by relative decreases in accounts payable million  accrued liabilities million and prepaid expenses and other current assets million during fiscal year the relative decrease from accounts payable was primarily due to a reduction in payables relating to oem magnets for our magnet based products due to our transition to internally sourced magnets  which was substantially completed in the first half of fiscal year  and the timing of other vendor payments 
the relative decrease from accrued liabilities was due to the higher conversion of customer advances on magnet based products during fiscal year the relative decrease from prepaid expenses and other current assets was primarily attributable to a reduction in deposits made for oem magnets for our magnet based products  also as a result of our transition to internally sourced magnets 
we used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal year  compared to million used for investing activities in fiscal year the decrease in cash used for investing activities in fiscal year was primarily the result of lower acquisition related payments 
during fiscal year  acquisition related payments totaled million and consisted of amounts previously retained to secure sellers indemnification obligations and contingent consideration payments related to acquisitions made in prior periods 
during fiscal year  acquisition related payments totaled million and included million and million for the acquisitions of polymer labs and ionspec  respectively  and million for contingent consideration payments relating to acquisitions made in prior years 
we used million of cash for financing activities in fiscal year  compared to million used for financing activities in fiscal year the increase in cash used for financing activities was primarily due to higher expenditures to repurchase and retire common stock such expenditures were made in both periods as a result of a continued effort to utilize excess cash to reduce the number of outstanding common shares 
we maintain relationships with banks in many countries from whom we sometimes obtain bank guarantees and short term standby letters of credit 
these guarantees and letters of credit relate primarily to advance payments and deposits made to our subsidiaries by customers for which separate liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
as of september   a total of million of these bank guarantees and letters of credit were outstanding 
no amounts had been drawn by beneficiaries under these or any other outstanding guarantees or letters of credit as of that date 
as of september   we had a million term loan outstanding with a us financial institution  compared to million at september  as of september   the fixed interest 
table of contents rate on the term loan was 
as of september   fixed interest rates on the term loan ranged from to with a weighted average of 
the term loan contains certain covenants that limit future borrowings and the payment of cash dividends and require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and operating results 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan agreement at september  in connection with the ionspec acquisition  we have accrued but not yet paid a portion of the purchase price that has been retained to secure the sellers indemnification obligations 
as of september   retained amounts for the ionspec acquisition totaled million  which is due to be paid net of any indemnification claims in february as of september   up to a maximum of million could be payable through february under contingent consideration arrangements relating to acquired businesses 
amounts subject to these arrangements can be earned over the respective measurement period  depending on the performance of the acquired business relative to certain financial targets 
the following table summarizes key terms of outstanding contingent consideration arrangements as of september  acquired business remaining amount available maximum measurement period measurement period end date ionspec million years february magnex million years november polymer labs million years november the distribution agreement provides that we are responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party and further provides that we will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see under item a risk factors environmental matters and governmental regulations 
we had no material cancelable or non cancelable commitments for capital expenditures as of september  in the aggregate  we currently anticipate that our capital expenditures will be about of sales in fiscal year in november  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we were authorized to utilize up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this repurchase program was effective until september  during the first quarter of fiscal year  we repurchased and retired  shares at an aggregate cost of million  which completed this repurchase program 
in january  our board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to utilize up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock 
this repurchase program is effective until december  during fiscal year  we repurchased and retired  shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of september   we had remaining authorization to repurchase million of our common stock under this program 
our liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry in which we compete and global economies 
although our cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our current cash balance and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes the amount and estimated timing of future cash expenditures relating to principal payments on outstanding long term debt  minimum rentals due for certain facilities and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases and other long term liabilities as of september  fiscal years thereafter total in thousands operating leases long term debt including current portion other long term liabilities total in addition to the non cancelable contractual obligations included in the above table  we had cancelable commitments to purchase certain superconducting magnets intended for use with nmr systems totaling approximately million  net of deposits paid  as of september  subsequent to that date  these commitments were canceled 
as of september   we did not have any off balance sheet commercial commitments that could result in a significant cash outflow upon the occurrence of some contingent event  except for contingent payments of up to a maximum of million related to acquisitions as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  the specific amounts of which are not currently determinable 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which addresses accounting for  and disclosure of  uncertain tax positions 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the requirements of fin and are not yet able to determine whether its adoption in the first quarter of fiscal year will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related disclosures using both the rollover and the iron curtain approach 
the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error originating in the current year income statement 
the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year of origin 
adjustment of financial statements would be required if either approach resulted in a material misstatement 
sab applies to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  our adoption of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal year did not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies to previous accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement  which provides companies with an option to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities in their entirety at fair value 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  and may be applied only to entire instruments 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in the item s fair value must be reported as unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the options provided under sfas and their potential impact on our financial condition and results of operations if implemented

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies 
from time to time  we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on forecasted transactions 
the success of our hedging activities depends on our ability to forecast balance sheet exposures and transaction activity in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
however  we believe that in most cases any such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the related foreign exchange forward contracts 
we therefore believe that the direct effect of an immediate change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and all other currencies is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
at september   there were no outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
during the fiscal year ended september   no foreign exchange gains or losses from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness were recognized 
our foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to months in original maturity 
a summary of all foreign exchange forward contracts that were outstanding as of september  follows notional value sold notional value purchased in thousands euro australian dollar japanese yen canadian dollar british pound danish krone total interest rate risk 
we have no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
we invest any excess cash primarily in short term us treasury securities and money market funds  and changes in interest rates would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations 
we enter into debt obligations principally to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
at september   our debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
based upon rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amount of long term debt approximates the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases 

table of contents debt obligations 
principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity fiscal years thereafter total dollars in thousands long term debt including current portion average interest rate defined benefit retirement plans 
most of our retirement plans  including all us based plans  are defined contribution plans 
however  we also provide defined benefit pension plans in certain countries outside of the us our obligations under these defined benefit plans will ultimately be settled in the future and are therefore subject to estimation 
defined benefit pension accounting under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as amended  is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees estimated service periods based on the terms of the pension plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
for our defined benefit pension plans  we make assumptions regarding several variables including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate in order to determine defined benefit pension plan expense for the year 
this expense is referred to as net periodic pension cost 
we assess the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rate assumption for each defined benefit plan based on relevant market conditions as prescribed by sfas and make adjustments to the assumptions as appropriate 
on an annual basis  we analyze the rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used and determine that these rates are reasonable 
for rates of return  this analysis is based on a review of the nature of the underlying assets  the allocation of those assets and their historical performance relative to the overall markets in the countries where the related plans are effective 
historically  our assumed asset allocations have not varied significantly from the actual allocations 
discount rates are based on the prevailing market long term interest rates in the countries where the related plans are effective 
as of september   the estimated long term rate of return on our defined benefit pension plan assets ranged from to weighted average of  and the assumed discount rate for our defined benefit pension plan obligations ranged from to weighted average of 
if any of these assumptions were to change  our net periodic pension cost would also change 
we incurred net periodic pension cost relating to our defined benefit pension plans of million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year excluding a settlement loss  and expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately million in fiscal year a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated return on plan assets or assumed discount rate would increase our net periodic pension cost for fiscal year by million or million  respectively 
as of september   our projected benefit obligation relating to defined benefit pension plans was million 
a one percent decrease in the weighted average estimated discount rate would increase this obligation by million
