on november   we entered into a share purchase agreement with pa meadows  llc  a company jointly owned by william paulos and william wortman  controlling shareholders of millennium gaming  inc and a fund managed by oaktree capital management  llc oaktree and together with pa meadows  llc  millennium oaktree  providing for the acquisition by millennium oaktree of all of the outstanding shares of washington trotting association  inc  mountain laurel racing  inc 
and mec pennsylvania racing  inc collectively the meadows entities  each wholly owned subsidiaries through which we owned and operated the meadows  a standardbred racetrack in pennsylvania 
on july   we entered into an amended share purchase agreement  which modified the original agreement 
as a result of regulatory requirements relating to the approval of the issuance of a gaming license by the pennsylvania gaming control board pgcb  as well as significant changes in the economic and regulatory environment in pennsylvania since the date of the original share purchase agreement  including regulations adopted by the pennsylvania department of revenue in respect of the amount of local share assessment taxes payable to north strabane township and washington county  the parties agreed to revise the terms of the original share purchase agreement 
the million purchase price in the original share purchase agreement  which included a million holdback note  was reduced to million  with a million holdback note  payable to us over a five year period  subject to offset for certain indemnification obligations 
in exchange for the shares of the meadows entities  we received two notes representing the purchase price in the amounts of million the first note and million the second note 
on september   the pgcb granted approval to washington trotting association  inc of a conditional category gaming license the gaming license 
on november   we completed the meadows transaction and received payment of the first note and received a million holdback note 
payments under the holdback agreement will be deferred until the opening of the permanent casino at the meadows 
pursuant to a racing services agreement entered into on july   we will continue to manage the racing operations at the meadows on behalf of millennium oaktree  for at least five years 
of the proceeds on the collection of the first note  million was used to pay the full amount of indebtedness outstanding under the bridge loan with mid  million was used to pay down our senior secured revolving bank credit facility  million was used to pay down the loan from be k  inc be k  the parent company of suitt construction co 
inc  the general contractor for the gulfstream park redevelopment project and million was put into escrow with mid to ensure adequate funding to fully repay the be k loan 
this transaction established fair values of the assets of the meadows and accordingly  we performed impairment testing of these assets as of the date immediately prior to completion of the transaction 
based on this analysis  we recognized a non cash impairment loss of million related to the long lived assets and a gain of million related to the disposition of the intangible assets  representing the racing gaming license 
based on the terms of various agreements to the transaction  for accounting purposes  the meadows real estate properties and fixed assets were not accounted for as a sale and leaseback  but rather using the financing method under us gaap as a result of continuing interest in the transaction 
accordingly  for accounting purposes  million of the proceeds have been deferred and recorded as a long term liability on the consolidated balance sheet at december  the deferred proceeds will be recognized over the five year term of the racing services agreement and or at the point when the sale leaseback subsequently qualifies for sales recognition 
given the indemnification obligations and other terms contained in the holdback agreement  the second note will be recognized in the financial statements upon the settlement of the indemnification obligations and as payments are received 
on november   we opened the gulfstream park racing casino slots facility 
the new casino facility currently offers guests access to slot machines  as well as poker 
we have commenced phase two of the slots facility and plan to have an additional slot machines installed and operational in the first half of under the existing slots legislation  a qualifying facility is entitled to offer up to  class iii slot machines  subject to a state tax rate of on gross gaming revenues ggr 
all proceeds from that tax will be used to supplement florida education 
each facility is also subject to a million annual license fee intended to cover administrative costs 
in addition  each facility has entered into separate contracts under which broward county and the city in which the facility conducts pari mutuel gaming will receive an aggregate of of that facility s ggr not exceeding million and of that facility s ggr in excess of million 
after negotiating with the florida horsemen s benevolent and protective association fhbpa during the first half of to secure a purse agreement  on august   we reached an agreement with the fhbpa  which entitles the horsemen to purse contributions equal to of ggr on the first gaming machines installed at gulfstream park 
as additional machines are installed  the percentage of ggr will decline 
once  gaming machines are installed  purse contributions will be equal to of ggr less than million and of ggr in excess of million 
funding for the two phases of the slots facility is being provided by two tranches of debt under the existing gulfstream park construction financing arrangement with mid 
we have proceeded with the development of the slots facility at gulfstream park despite an august decision rendered by the florida district court of appeals first district that reversed a lower court decision granting summary judgment in favor of floridians for a level playing field flpf  a group in which gulfstream park is a member 
the court ruled that a trial is necessary to determine whether the constitutional amendment adopting the slots initiative  approved by floridians in the november election  was invalid because the petitions bringing the initiative forward did not contain the minimum number of valid signatures 
flpf filed an application for a rehearing  rehearing en banc before the full panel of the first district court of appeals and certification by the florida supreme court 
on november   in a split decision  the en banc court affirmed the august panel decision and certified the matter to the florida supreme court  which stayed the appellate court ruling pending its jurisdictional review of the matter 
as of march   the florida supreme court had not confirmed whether it will hear the matter 
we believe that the august decision rendered by the florida district court of appeals is incorrect and accordingly  we are proceeding with the slots facility development

the passage of such legislation can be a long and uncertain process 
in addition  should alternative gaming legislation be enacted in any jurisdiction in which we operate  there are a number of factors which will determine the viability and profitability of such an operation at our racetracks 
these factors include  without limitation  the income or revenue sharing terms contained in the legislation and applicable licenses  the conditions governing the operation of the gaming facility  the number  size and location of the competitor sites which are also licensed to offer alternative gaming  the availability of financing on acceptable terms and the provisions of any ongoing agreements with the parties from whom we purchased the racetrack in question

total population residing within miles of each of our racetracks  except for santa anita park and magna racino miles  the meadows miles and great lakes downs miles 
data from urban systems inc amounts comprising total handle and revenue include inter company transactions for our racetracks  account wagering operations and separate otb facilities  for both our importing and our exporting facilities 
revenue excludes our amtote operations  our training centers  hrtv and our straw based horse bedding production facilities in europe and north carolina 
rental and other revenues earned from the oak tree meet are included in santa anita park s revenue 
our primary source of racing revenues is commissions earned from pari mutuel wagering 
pari mutuel wagering on horse racing is a form of wagering in which wagers on horse races are aggregated in a commingled pool of wagers the mutuel pool and the payoff to winning customers is determined by both the total dollar amount of wagers in the mutuel pool and the allocation of those dollars among the various kinds of bets 
unlike casino gambling  the customers bet against each other  and not against us  and therefore we bear no risk of loss with respect to any wagering conducted 
we retain a pre determined percentage of the total amount wagered the take out on each event  regardless of the outcome of the wagering event  and the remaining balance of the mutuel pool is distributed to the winning customers 
of the percentage we retain  a portion is paid to the horse owners in the form of purses or winnings  which encourage the horse owners and their trainers to enter their horses in our races 
our share of pari mutuel wagering revenues is based on pre determined percentages of various categories of the pooled wagers at our racetracks 
the maximum pre determined percentages are approved by state regulators 
pari mutuel wagering on horse racing occurs on the live races being conducted at racetracks  as well as on televised racing signals  or simulcasts  received or imported by the simulcast wagering facilities located at such racetracks or otb facilities  and through various forms of account wagering 
our racetracks have simulcast wagering facilities to complement our live horse racing  enabling our customers to wager on horse races being held at other racetracks 
we derive our pari mutuel wagering revenues from the following primary sources wagers placed at our racetracks or our otb facilities on live racing conducted at our racetracks  wagers placed at our racetracks simulcast wagering venues or our otb facilities on races imported from other racetracks  wagers placed at other locations ie other racetracks  otb facilities or casinos on live racing signals exported by our racetracks  and wagers placed by telephone or over the internet by customers enrolled in xpressbet or magnabet  our account wagering platforms 
wagers placed at our racetracks or our otb facilities on live racing conducted at one of our racetracks produce more net revenue for us than wagers placed on imported racing signals  because we must pay the racetrack sending us its signal a fee generally equal to to of the amount wagered on its race 
wagers placed on imported signals  in turn  produce more revenue for us than wagers placed on our signals exported to off track venues ie other racetracks  otb facilities or casinos  where we are paid a commission generally equal to only to of the amount wagered at the off track venue on the signal we export to those venues 
revenues from our telephone and internet account wagering operations vary depending upon the source of the signal upon which the wager is placed 
we also generate gaming revenues from our remington park and gulfstream park gaming operations 
gaming revenues represent the net win earned on slot wagers 
net win is the difference between wagers placed and winning payouts to patrons 
we also generate non wagering revenues which include totalisator equipment sales and service revenues from amtote earned in the provision of totalisator services to racetracks  food and beverage sales  program sales  admissions  parking  sponsorship  rental fees and other revenues 
live race days are a significant factor in the operating and financial performance of our racing business 
another significant factor is the level of wagering per customer on our racing content on track  at inter track simulcast locations and at otb facilities 
there are also many other factors that have a significant impact on our racetrack revenues 
such factors include  but are not limited to attendance at our racetracks  inter track simulcast locations and otb facilities  activity through our xpressbet and magnabet systems  the number of races conducted at our racetracks and at racetracks whose signals we import and the average field size per race  our ability to attract the industry s top horses and trainers  inclement weather  and changes in the economy

because five of our largest racetracks  santa anita park  gulfstream park  lone star park at grand prairie  pimlico race course and golden gate fields  run live race meets principally during the first half of the year  our racing operations have historically operated at a loss in the second half of the year  with our third quarter generating the largest operating loss 
this seasonality has resulted in large quarterly fluctuations in revenue and operating results 
real estate and other operations our real estate and other revenues represent revenues earned from our european residential development 
this segment excludes the operations and results of the magna golf club and fontana golf club  which were sold in august and november  respectively  as these are reported as discontinued operations 
we characterize our real estate as follows revenue producing racing real estate real estate at our racetracks used in our racing operations  excess racing real estate excess real estate at our racetracks that we are considering developing with strategic partners or otherwise  development real estate real estate not at our racetracks that is under development  or that we are holding for development  either as a racetrack or other project  revenue producing non racing real estate developed real estate not at our racetracks that is currently generating revenue for us  and non core real estate real estate that is available for sale 
as of december   the aggregate net book values of our real estate properties are as follows millions revenue producing racing real estate excess racing real estate development real estate revenue producing non racing real estate non core real estate included in our excess racing real estate is land adjacent to several of our racetracks  santa anita park  gulfstream park  lone star park at grand prairie  laurel park in respect of which we disposed of a portion of the excess land  a acre parcel  subsequent to december   pimlico race course and magna racino 
we are considering a variety of options with respect to this excess land  including entertainment and retail based developments that could be undertaken in conjunction with business partners who could be expected to provide the necessary financing 
our development real estate  which is largely undeveloped  includes approximately acres of land in oberwaltersdorf  austria  located approximately miles south of vienna  austria  approximately acres of land in upstate new york  approximately acres of land in dixon  california  located approximately miles southwest of sacramento  approximately acres of land in ocala  florida  approximately acres of land in palm beach county  florida  adjacent to our training center  which is currently under development for a residential community  and approximately acres of land in aurora  ontario  canada of which all of our interests and rights were disposed of subsequent to december  
our revenue producing non racing real estate includes our european residential development 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and prudent in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
however  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible and long lived assets our most significant intangible assets are racing licenses which represent the value attributed to licenses to conduct race meets acquired through our acquisition of racetracks 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  intangibles are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or when impairment indicators are present 
racing license impairment is assessed based on a comparison of the fair value of an individual reporting unit s racing license to its carrying value 
an impairment write down to fair value would occur if estimated discounted cash flows from operations  less charges for contributory assets assumed to be owned by third parties is less than the carrying value of the racing license 
under financial accounting standards board statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of the long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows 
if the sum of expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than net book value  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value  based on discounted future cash flows and appraisals  is charged to operations in the period in which such impairment is determined by management 
we believe the accounting estimates related to intangibles and long lived asset impairment assessments are critical accounting estimates because they are subject to significant measurement uncertainty and are susceptible to change as management is required to make forward looking assumptions regarding cash flows and business operations 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our consolidated operating results and on the amount of assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
future income tax assets at december   we recorded future tax assets net of related valuation allowances in respect of loss carryforwards and other deductible temporary differences 
we evaluate quarterly the realizability of our future tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and by adjusting the allowance as necessary 
the assessment considers forecasts of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the future tax assets 
should operations not yield future taxable income or if tax planning strategies could not be implemented  then there could be a material impact on our consolidated tax expense or recovery and on the amount of future tax assets reported on our consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense recognized includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
revenue recognition a significant component of our revenues is generated from our racing and gaming operations 
revenues generated from horse racing are recorded on a daily basis and are recognized gross of purses  stakes and awards as well as pari mutuel wagering taxes 
gaming revenues represent the net win earned on slots wagers 
net win is the difference between wagers placed and winning payouts to patrons  and is recorded at the time wagers are made 
non wagering revenues include totalisator equipment sales and service revenues from amtote earned in the provision of totalisator services to racetracks  food and beverage sales  program sales  admissions  parking  sponsorship  rental fees and other revenues 
revenues derived principally from totalisator equipment sales are recognized upon shipment or acceptance of the equipment by the customer depending on the terms of the underlying contracts 
revenues generated from service contracts in the provision of totalisator services are recognized when earned based on the terms of the service contract 
revenues from food and beverage and program sales are recorded at the time of sale 
revenues from admissions and parking are recorded on a daily basis  except for seasonal amounts which are recorded ratably over the racing season 
revenues from sponsorship and rental fees are recorded ratably over the terms of the respective agreements or when the related event occurs 
revenues from the sale of residential development inventory are recognized when title passes to the purchaser and collection is reasonably assured 
employee defined benefit and postretirement plans in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas requires employers to recognize the funded status the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligations of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income loss  net of tax  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the balance sheet date and provide additional disclosures about certain effects on net periodic benefit cost for the next fiscal year that arise from delayed recognition of the gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations 
on december   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas the adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income loss upon adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial gain or loss determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  which was previously netted against the plan s funded status pursuant to the provisions of sfas these amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our historical accounting policy for amortizing such amounts 
further  actuarial gains and losses that arise in subsequent periods and are not recognized as net periodic pension cost in the same periods will be recognized as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
those amounts will be subsequently recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost on the same basis as the amounts recognized in accumulated comprehensive income loss upon adoption of sfas litigation in the ordinary course of business  we may be contingently liable for litigation and claims with  among others  customers  suppliers and former employees 
management believes that adequate provisions have been recorded in the accounts where required 
although it is not possible to accurately estimate the extent of potential costs and losses  if any  management believes  but can provide no assurance  that the ultimate resolution of such contingencies would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that have not been disclosed in either our consolidated financial statements or in this report 
related party transactions refer to note to our consolidated financial statements which describes all material related party transactions 
results of operations the following is a discussion and comparison of our results of operations and financial position for the years ended december   and year ended december  compared to december  racing and gaming operations in  we operated our largest racetracks for two fewer live race days compared to the prior year primarily due to a change in the racing calendar at the maryland jockey club  partially offset by an increase in awarded live race days at golden gate fields 
our other racetracks operated for five additional live race days in  compared to the prior year  primarily due to additional live race days awarded at remington park and portland meadows  partially offset by a planned reduction in live race days at thistledown 
in  revenues from our racing and gaming operations increased million or to million  compared to million in  primarily due to southern us operations above the prior year by million or due to gaming revenues at the remington park casino facility  which opened in november and generated million of gaming revenues in  with an average daily net win per machine of compared to gaming revenues of million in  with an average daily net win per machine of  partially offset by decreased handle and revenues at lone star park due to three fewer live race days in compared to and increased competition from racetracks in surrounding states and internet wagering operations  technology operations above the prior year by million or as a result of the acquisition of the remaining equity interest in amtote in july  the operations of which are now being consolidated into the technology operations  whereas previously our equity interest was accounted for on an equity basis and increased wagering activity through magnabet  florida revenues above the prior year by million or due to the opening of the slots facility on november  as well as increased racing revenues due to the opening of the new clubhouse facility at gulfstream park 
the gulfstream park slots facility generated million of gaming revenues in with an average daily net win per machine of the live race meet conducted in the first half of operated out of temporary facilities which affected revenues despite best efforts to minimize the disruption s negative impact  california revenues above the prior year by million or due to increased attendance and higher levels of handle and wagering at santa anita park throughout the live race meet as a result of good weather in southern california and focused marketing initiatives to attract patrons back to the track 
southern california experienced significant rainfall during the live race meet  which resulted in lower attendance and gross wagering and a reduction in the number of races that were run on the turf course during the live race meet 
turf course races typically generate higher levels of wagering  and a change in the racing calendar at golden gate fields  whereby live race days were increased from days in to days in maryland operations above the prior year by million or due to increased food and beverage revenues from maryland turf caterers  the food and beverage operations at laurel park and pimlico  which was acquired in september these operations are now being consolidated into the maryland operations  whereas previously the operations were accounted for on an equity basis 
the increase is also attributable to increased wagering on laurel park racing content as a result of the new turf course at laurel park  which has resulted in increased field sizes and handle 
average daily export handle on laurel park racing content was up significantly in compared to  evidencing higher quality racing that has generated increased wagering activity  northern us operations below the prior year by million or due primarily to a planned change in the racing calendar at thistledown whereby live race days were decreased from days in to days in pari mutuel purses  awards and other increased million or to million in  from million in  primarily due to increased wagering at santa anita park  golden gate fields and gulfstream park for reasons noted above

as a percentage of total racing and gaming revenues  operating costs decreased from in to in  primarily as a result of the increase in racing and gaming revenues 
general and administrative expenses in our racing and gaming operations increased million to million in  from million in the increase is primarily attributable to increased costs at our corporate office as a result of million in severance for three senior executives at our corporate office  which includes million of stock based compensation and an additional million of costs relating to stock based compensation for other executives and employees

we are continuing to pursue other funding sources in connection with the recapitalization plan  which may include further asset sales  partnerships  and raising capital through equity offerings under the us registration statement and the canadian prospectus filed february   however  the successful realization of these efforts is not determinable at this time 
the financial statements included with this report do not give effect to any adjustments which would be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern and  therefore  be required to realize our assets and discharge our liabilities in other than the normal course of business and at amounts different from those reflected in the financial statements

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk related to financial instruments or the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices is with respect to our investments in companies with a functional currency other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate relative to the canadian dollar and the euro will result in fluctuations in shareholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
we have generally not entered into derivative financial arrangements for currency hedging purposes  and have not and will not enter into such arrangements for speculative purposes 
additionally  we are exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as libor and euribor 
based on interest rates at december  and our current credit and debt facilities  a per annum increase or decrease in interest rates on our short term credit facility and other variable rate borrowings would not materially affect our annual future earnings and cash flows 
based on borrowing rates currently available to us  the carrying amount of our debt approximates its fair value 
in order to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the sac term loan facility  we have entered into two interest rate swap contracts 
effective november   we have entered into an interest rate swap contract and fixed the rate of interest at per annum to october  on a notional amount of of the outstanding balance under this secured term loan facility  which is million as at december  effective november   we have entered into an interest rate swap contract and fixed the rate of interest at per annum to october  on a notional amount of million
