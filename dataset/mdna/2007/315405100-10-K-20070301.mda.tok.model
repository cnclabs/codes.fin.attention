item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview market conditions in were generally favorable and sales increased in a number of product lines and regions 
sales increased most significantly in our electronic materials  performance coatings and color and glass performance materials segments 
sales grew at a slower pace in our polymer additives segment  and declined in specialty plastics 
both the polymer additives and specialty plastics segments were affected by weaker demand during the second half of the year from north american customers serving residential construction and automotive markets 
for the year  sales increased by approximately in north america  in europe  in asia and in latin america 
total company sales increased by 
beyond fundamental product demand  the factors that most affected results included the following increased and volatile raw material costs  and our ability to adjust selling prices to maintain our profitability  increased borrowing levels and increased interest rates on our debt  cost control initiatives  including costs associated with restructuring programs  and costs incurred for the accounting investigation and restatement process 
prices for a number of raw materials increased significantly during the year 
natural gas prices were high in the beginning of the year  but moderated somewhat as the year progressed 
we were able to adjust product prices higher  in aggregate  to cover increases in raw material costs 
we also reformulated certain products to provide customers with alternatives that used less costly raw materials 
in some cases we also employed hedging strategies to reduce the volatility of our raw material costs and provide more time to change prices in anticipation of future raw material cost increases 
during  our debt levels increased  largely as a result of increased deposit requirements for precious metal consignment arrangements and for increased working capital to support higher sales 
in addition  we entered into new revolving credit and term loan agreements during the year that included higher interest rates than the 
table of contents agreements they replaced 
as a result  our interest expense increased 
also during  we initiated multiple restructuring programs that are expected to reduce our operating costs in future years 
as part of these programs  we recorded asset impairments  accelerated depreciation  severance and other costs that reduced our overall profitability 
in  we recorded costs associated with the accounting investigation and restatements of our and first quarter consolidated financial statements 
we completed the restatements of those financial statements in and became current in our financial filings with the sec 
total segment income increased in to million from million in this improvement was driven by increases in the electronic materials  performance coatings  color and glass performance materials and specialty plastics segments  primarily as the result of improved prices 
segment income in polymer additives declined for the year  primarily as a result of higher manufacturing costs throughout the year and weaker sales volume in the fourth quarter 
income from continuing operations for the year increased to million from million in the primary reasons for the increase were higher sales  improving gross profit  lower selling  general and administrative expenses  increased interest earned and lower taxes 
these improvements were partially offset by higher restructuring related costs and increased interest expense 
during  working capital increased as a result of higher receivables and inventory levels required to support increased sales 
as a result of the higher working capital requirements  including cash deposit requirements for precious metal consignments  total short term and long term debt increased by million 
also  at the end of  our note receivable from ferro finance corporation ffc  a wholly owned unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity  was million  down from million at the end of this change reflects proceeds from ffc in excess of trade accounts receivable sold to ffc during in our primary receivable sales program 
an additional million investment by ferro corporation in fcc was the primary driver of an increase in other non current assets at the end of  compared with the end of post retirement and pension liabilities declined in  primarily as the result of million in curtailments resulting from changes to our us pension and post retirement benefit programs  as announced in february  and settlements paid  primarily to the beneficiaries of our deceased former chief executive officer  from a non qualified defined benefit retirement plan 
our financial condition and the refinancing of our former credit facility significantly affected the nature of our cash flows 
this resulted in a decrease in net borrowing cash flows for as compared with of million and the payment of debt issue costs in of million 
also as a result of our financial condition in  we were required to invest million in ferro finance corporation and to place million more on deposit for precious metals 
in  we were required to place million more on deposit for precious metals 
increased working capital requirements for accounts receivable and inventories aggregating million negatively impacted operating cash flows for these were offset by increased net income of million  increased non cash restructuring charges of million  increased depreciation expense of million due to accelerated depreciation  other changes in working capital aggregating million  and increased proceeds from our asset securitization program of million  which positively impacted operating cash flows for outlook economic conditions continue to be generally favorable  although we expect differences between geographic regions 
we expect to continue overall sales growth  although weaker demand in the united states  particularly from customers serving markets related to residential construction and automotive production  is expected to continue for several quarters 
we expect to continue to record charges associated with current and future restructuring programs  particularly related to our rationalization of the manufacturing assets in our european operations 
interest expense is expected to decline somewhat from the levels experienced during the final quarter of as a result of lower deposit requirements on precious metals and slightly lower interest rates realized by becoming current on our financial reporting

improved volumes in europe and latin america were offset by volume declines in north america and asia 
on a consolidated basis  favorable changes in foreign exchange rates increased sales by less than one percent 
gross profit increased during  compared with the increase in gross profit was the result of higher sales  and prices that increased more than the aggregate increase in raw material costs 
gross margin percentage  defined as gross profit as a percentage of sales  declined in  compared with  as a result of accelerated depreciation costs and higher precious metal prices 
gross profit was reduced by million in as a result of costs associated with our manufacturing rationalization programs 
higher precious metal costs also contributed to the decline in gross margin percentage because changes in precious metal prices are generally passed through to customers without gross margin contribution 
selling  general and administrative sg a costs decreased by million during  while sg a expenses as a percent of revenues declined from to during the year 
charges of million  primarily related to the accounting investigation and restatement  were recorded as part of sg a expense during these charges were million less than the amount recorded in this reduction in sg a expense was partially offset by other expense increases required to support the growth in sales  particularly in our electronic materials business 
during the first quarter of  we announced changes to some of our postretirement benefit programs 
certain employees who had been participating in our largest defined benefit program stopped accruing benefit service after march  in addition  we limited eligibility for retiree medical and life insurance coverage to those employees who were years of age or older with or more years of service as of december  benefits under these programs will be available only to those employees who retire by december   after having advised us of their retirement plans by march  these changes resulted in a one time benefit of million in the second quarter of offsetting this benefit was a million settlement loss from a 
table of contents nonqualified benefit retirement plan  related primarily to a lump sum payment to the beneficiary of ferro s deceased former chief executive officer 
restructuring charges of million were recorded in  primarily associated with the consolidation and closing of some of our manufacturing assets in our performance coatings and color and glass performance materials segments in europe and our electronic materials segment in the united states 
interest expense was higher in as a result of increased debt levels and higher interest rates 
our total borrowings were increased  in part  as a result of higher cash deposit requirements on precious metal consignment arrangements 
these deposits increased from million at the end of to million at the end of we expect that these deposit requirements will be less in  as a result of our regaining current status on financial reporting and our efforts to negotiate more favorable terms from participants in our consignment programs 
borrowings also increased as a result of other increased working capital requirements used to support higher sales levels 
during  inventories increased to million from million in net receivables increased to million from million in the prior year 
also included in the interest expense are charges of million associated with previously unamortized fees and discounts related to certain of our debentures that were repaid in july and august and previously unamortized fees related to our former revolving credit facility 
interest earned during increased to million from million in primarily as a result of interest earned on cash deposits associated with our precious metal consignments 
net foreign currency losses were largely unchanged from to we use certain foreign currency financial instruments to offset  or hedge  short term transactions that are denominated in non dollar currencies 
the carrying values of these contracts are adjusted to market value and the resulting gains or losses are charged to income or expense in the period 
in  we recognized a million gain on the sale of our interest in chilches materials sa  an unconsolidated affiliate  and a million loss from the liquidation of ferro toyo company limited  a consolidated subsidiary 
net miscellaneous income from continuing operations was million in  compared with income of million in within net miscellaneous income during  we recorded a gain of million for a legal settlement in a class action lawsuit for price fixing in the rubber chemicals industry 
in addition  we recorded a loss of million associated with mark to market supply contracts  mainly for natural gas 
during  we recorded a gain of million associated with supply contracts 
for the year  taxes on continuing income were million  or of income  compared to million or of income in the primary reason for the decrease in was a net decrease in our valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not certain deferred assets would be realized  and a tax rate change in the netherlands affecting our deferred income taxes 
the decrease was partially offset by an allowance for unremitted earnings from foreign subsidiaries no longer considered indefinitely reinvested

sales grew in performance coatings as a result of improved pricing across the business and improved volumes in the tile coatings portion of the business 
sales growth was strong in north america  europe and latin america  while overall sales in asia declined modestly 
growth in asia was negatively impacted by natural gas supply issues in indonesia  which affected both our own and our customers manufacturing operations 
favorable currency exchange rates also contributed to the sales increase for the year 
operating income increased during primarily because pricing was increased in excess of raw material cost increases 
in addition  the mix of products was more favorable  particularly in our porcelain enamel business 
electronic materials segment results 
sales in electronic materials were sharply higher for the year due to strong customer demand for metal pastes for solar cells and materials for multilayer capacitors  compared with when customers demand was weak for capacitor materials in the first half of the year 
in addition  higher precious metals prices  which are passed through to customers  contributed to the sales increase 
sales increased in north america  asia and europe 
operating income increased as a result of the combination of improved volume  product mix  pricing and lower manufacturing costs 
these improvements more than offset increases in raw material costs and increased product development expense 
color and glass performance materials segment results 
sales in color and glass performance materials increased primarily as a result of improved pricing 
sales growth was the strongest in europe  and sales also grew in latin america and asia 
sales were relatively flat in north america 
operating income increased as improved pricing more than offset increased raw material costs 
polymer additives segment results 
sales in polymer additives increased for the year  although the growth rate was negatively impacted by weak demand in north america during the fourth quarter 
this weakness was mainly due to reduced customer demand for products used in residential construction 
for the year  improved pricing and product mix more than offset declines in volume 
sales increases in europe were partially offset by declines in north america 
segment income declined for the year 
although price increases exceeded raw material cost increases for the year  these increases were not enough to offset lower volumes and increased manufacturing costs  resulting in a decline in segment income 

table of contents specialty plastics segment results 
sales declined in specialty plastics primarily as a result of weakness in the north american market during the second half of the year 
during that period  customer demand related to us residential construction and automotive production declined  leading to lower sales volume 
although prices increased  they did not increase enough to offset the lower volume 
despite the lower volume  operating income increased due to price increases  lower manufacturing costs and lower sg a expenses  which together more than offset raw material cost increases 
change change dollars in thousands geographic revenues united states international total sales increased in the united states  driven by increases in electronic materials and performance coatings

weakness in the market for multilayer capacitors depressed unit demand and revenues  particularly in the first half of on a consolidated basis  the impact of strengthening foreign currencies versus the us dollar had only a minimal positive impact on revenues 
the reduced gross margin percentage was mainly due to a combination of higher raw materials costs and lower customer unit demand  partially offset by a more favorable price and mix of products sold 

table of contents as a percent of sales  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were in  compared with in the prior year period 
the lower sg a expense primarily was driven by ongoing cost reduction measures which resulted in a decline in spending for sales  technical service  research and development  partially offset by an increase in fees related to the accounting investigation and restatement 
during  we recorded as part of sg a expenses million relating to the accounting investigation and restatements of our and first quarter consolidated financial statements 
the increase in interest expense was due to the combined effect of higher interest rates on our variable rate borrowings and increased borrowing levels 
long term debt increased to million on december   compared with million on december  the increase was partially due to increased deposit requirements on precious metal consignment agreements in the fourth quarter of in addition  increased borrowings were made to support higher working capital requirements  primarily driven by a decline in accounts payable 
we use certain foreign currency instruments to offset the effect of changing exchange rates on foreign subsidiary earnings and short term transaction exposures 
the carrying values of such contracts are adjusted to market value and resulting gains or losses are charged to income or expense in the period 
in  we recognized million as gain on sale of business and related to the sale of our interest in tokan material technology co 
limited  which was an unconsolidated affiliate 
there were no divestitures made in during  we recorded gains of million associated with marked to market forward supply contracts  primarily for natural gas 
during  we recorded a loss of million from marked to market supply contracts 
partially offsetting this increase were higher minority interest expenses  lower realized gains on investments designated to fund payments for a nonqualified benefit plan  and lower gains on sales of fixed assets in income tax as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations for the year ended december   was compared with for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in was our reversal of valuation allowances due to utilization of net operating losses and our determination that  more likely than not  certain deferred tax assets would be realized 
also contributing to the higher effective tax rate in was a higher proportion of earnings in jurisdictions having higher effective tax rates

the higher revenue in the performance coatings segment was due to price increases and a favorable mix of products  as well as improved volumes 
growth was mainly within our tile coatings business  and was distributed across the asia pacific  european and north american markets 
the increase in segment gross profit was driven primarily by increased volume and higher average selling prices  which more than offset higher raw materials costs 
electronic materials segment results 
the decline in revenue for our electronic materials segment was largely due to weakness in the demand for multilayer capacitors due to inventory corrections by our customers 
these inventory corrections resulted in sharply lower volumes 
sales increased in asia pacific  but not enough to offset declines in north america and europe 
the decline in segment gross profit reflected the lower volume of products sold  and the resulting negative impact of fixed manufacturing costs coupled with lower prices for the company s products 
color and glass performance materials segment results 
the volume increase for the year in our color and glass performance materials segment was slightly larger than the decline due to the combination of price and a less favorable product mix 
the higher segment gross profit was due primarily to improvements in the average selling price of products sold 
this improvement was partially offset by higher raw materials costs 
polymer additives segment results 
the year over year increase in sales for our polymer additives segment was primarily due to improved performance in north american end markets  including vinyl processing and construction 
increased pricing  particularly in the markets for polymer modifiers  more than offset a reduction in volumes across the polymer additives product lines 
the increased segment gross profit was due to these pricing increases and to lower sg a expenses result from previous cost cutting programs 

table of contents specialty plastics segment results 
the year over year increase in sales for our specialty plastics segment was primarily due to improved demand for north american durable goods  including automobiles and appliances

summary of cash flows years ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was driven by the increase in net income of million in  supplemented by increased proceeds from the asset securitization program of million  an increase in non cash restructuring charges of million and changes in other working capital items of million 
the other reconciling items primarily had positive impacts to operating cash flows and related to deferred income taxes  retirement benefits and increased depreciation expense of million primarily due to accelerated depreciation 
offsetting these positive cash flow items were increased changes in deposit requirements under the company s precious metals consignment program of million  increased changes in inventories of million  and increased changes in accounts receivable of million 
the increase in inventory levels was primarily due to a discrete build in inventory levels and increases to raw material prices from suppliers 
accounts receivable increased due to higher net sales 
in  cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations decreased million as compared to we increased our use of cash for retirement benefits by million during the year 
we also increased payments of accounts payable by million in order to manage vendor relationships 
we used operating cash through lower net income of million  increased accounts receivable balance of million due to increased sales  and other operating cash outflows of million 
partially offsetting these decreases in operating cash flows were slower growth in inventories of million and a reduction in the balance of the note receivable from ferro finance corporation and the asset securitization program of million 
additionally  the cash flow impact from accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million favorably impacted operating cash flows  primarily due to the payment of such liabilities in without comparable payment levels in investing activities 
in june  the company invested an additional million in ferro finance corporation  a wholly owned unconsolidated subsidiary  in connection with the june amendment of the asset 
table of contents securitization agreement 
capital expenditures during increased million as compared with the primary reasons for the increased capital spending included the start of construction of a freestanding  state of the art plant in spain that will produce colors for the european tile market and increased investment in the company s manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region 
in  cash flows from investing activities decreased million as compared to the decreased in cash flows from investing activities reflected the absence of a discrete adjustment to the purchase price of a prior acquisition of million  decreased proceeds from the sales of assets and businesses of and increased capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million 
expenditures for property  plant and equipment increased due in our investments in production equipment in the asia pacific region 
financing activities 
in march  we accepted a commitment from a group of lenders for a million credit facility the new credit facility and  in june  finalized the agreement 
the new credit facility consists of a five year  million multi currency senior revolving credit facility and a six year  million senior term loan facility 
the new credit facility replaced the former revolving credit facility that would have expired in september in june  ferro borrowed million of the term loan facility to partially repay the former revolving credit facility 
in addition  in july and august of  we borrowed another million of the term loan facility to repay million of outstanding debentures  as bondholders accelerated payment of these obligations due to defaults caused by our delayed financial filings with the sec for in  our net borrowings on long term debt decreased to million as compared with borrowings of million  for a net decrease in our rate of borrowing of million 
we paid million in debt issue costs to establish and use the new credit facility in  whereas in we did not pay any debt issue costs 
increased short term borrowings of million and other financing activities of million as compared to offset the negative financing cash flows described above 
we also continued to pay dividends on our common stock at our historical quarterly rate of per share  totaling million in in  cash flows from financing activities increased million as compared to this increase reflected our borrowing on the former revolving credit facility of million in order to finance operations  offset by other changes in financing cash flows and short term borrowings of million 
capital resources and liquidity new credit facility at december   we had borrowed million of the revolving credit facility and had million available  after reductions for standby letters of credit secured by this facility 
in addition  we can request an increase of million in the revolving credit facility 
at the same time  we had borrowed million of the term loan facility and had million available  which we drew down in january and used to partially repay the revolving credit facility 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the new credit facility 
senior notes at december   we had million principal amount outstanding under senior notes 
in march  standard poor s rating group s p downgraded the company s senior credit rating from bb to b  and moody s investor service  inc moody s downgraded its rating from ba to b and then withdrew its rating 
moody s cited the absence of audited financial statements for a sustained period of time and the concern that there may be additional delays in receiving audited financials for moody s also noted that the company s business profile is consistent with a rating in the ba category  according to moody s rating methodology for the chemical industry 
moody s indicated it could reassign ratings to the company after we filed audited financial statements for and with the sec 
we have filed these statements with the sec and have had initial discussions with moody s about reinstatement of its ratings 
in april  we received from the trustee of the senior notes a notice of default caused by our delayed financial filings with the sec for in december  we became current with all of our financial reporting 
table of contents requirements under the senior notes  and the related default was no longer continuing 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants under the indentures for the senior notes 
off balance sheet arrangements receivable sales programs 
we sell  on an ongoing basis  substantially all of ferro s us trade accounts receivable under an asset securitization program 
this program accelerates cash collections at favorable financing costs and helps us manage the company s liquidity requirements 
we sell these trade accounts receivable to ferro finance corporation ffc  a wholly owned unconsolidated qualified special purpose entity qspe 
ffc finances its acquisition of trade receivable assets by issuing beneficial interests in securitizing the receivables to multi seller receivables securitization companies conduits for proceeds of up to million 
ffc and the conduits have no recourse to ferro s other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due as the assets transferred are legally isolated in accordance with the us bankruptcy laws 
ferro s consolidated balance sheet does not include the trade receivables sold  but does include a note receivable from ffc to the extent that cash proceeds from the sales of accounts receivable to ffc have not yet been received by ferro 
in june  we amended the program to cure a default that resulted from a credit rating downgrade  to modify the reporting requirements to more closely match those in the new credit facility  and to extend the program to june the program requires ffc to maintain a minimum tangible net worth 
to meet this requirement  we invested an additional million in ffc in june at december   ffc had received net proceeds of million for outstanding receivables  and the balance of ferro s note receivable from ffc was million 
in addition  we maintain several international programs to sell trade accounts receivable  primarily without recourse 
the commitments supporting this program can be withdrawn at any time and totaled million at december  the amount of outstanding receivables sold under the international programs was million at december  consignment and customer arrangements for precious metals 
in the production of some of our products  we use precious metals  primarily silver for electronic materials products and gold for color and glass performance materials products 
we obtain most precious metals from financial institutions under consignment agreements with terms of one year or less 
the financial institutions retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign 
these fees were million for in november  the financial institutions renewed their requirement for cash deposits from us to provide additional collateral beyond the value of the underlying precious metals 
outstanding collateral deposits grew from million at december   to million during  but declined to million by december  we also process precious metals owned by our customers 
at december   we had on hand million of precious metals owned by financial institutions  measured at fair value 
bank guarantees and standby letters of credit 
at december   the company had bank guarantees and standby letters of credit issued by financial institutions  which totaled million 
these agreements primarily relate to ferro s insurance programs  natural gas contracts  potential environmental remediation liabilities  and foreign tax payments 
other financing arrangement we maintain other lines of credit to provide global flexibility for ferro s short term liquidity requirements 
these facilities are uncommitted lines for our international operations and totaled million at december  the unused portions of these lines provided million of additional liquidity at december  liquidity requirement our liquidity requirements primarily include debt service  purchase commitments  working capital requirements  capital investments  postretirement obligations and dividend payments 
ferro s level of debt and debt service requirements could have important consequences to its business operations and uses of cash flows 

table of contents the company s aggregate amount of obligations for the next five years and thereafter is set forth below thereafter totals dollars in thousands loans payable to banks senior notes revolving credit facility term loan facility other long term notes obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases purchase commitments cash required for interest costs in was million 
we expect that the amount for will not be substantially different  but the actual amount depends on interest rates on our variable rate debt and our overall debt levels 
we pay taxes as part of our normal operations as a profitable company 
the amount of taxes we pay depends on a variety of factors described in more detail in critical accounting policies below 
however  the principal factors are the level of our profitability and the countries in which we earn our taxable income 
we have paid and expect to continue to pay taxes for the foreseeable future 
based on the historical relationship between pretax income and the amount of income taxes we have paid  we expect to pay a substantially higher amount of taxes in we expect to contribute approximately million to our post employment benefit plans in over the four year period from through  we may be required to contribute an additional million to these plans 
we determined these funding amounts based on the minimum contributions required under various applicable regulations in each respective country 
actual contributions also depend on the future funded status of the plans and on the amount of employee contributions 
critical accounting policies and their application when we prepare our financial statements we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts we report in the financial statements and footnotes 
we consider the policies discussed below to be more critical than other policies because their application requires our most subjective or complex judgments 
these estimates and judgments arise because of the inherent uncertainty in predicting future events 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined utilizing the first in  first out fifo method  except for selected inventories where the last in  first out lifo method is used 
as of december   we are considering changing our accounting method for those inventories valued on the lifo method to the fifo method 
this potential change in accounting method could result in an increase in inventory values of million upon the date of adoption 
if we make such a change  our financial statements would be retroactively adjusted to reflect the new method in each period presented 
we periodically evaluate the net realizable value of inventories based primarily upon their age  but also upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
as a result of the evaluation  the inventory may be written down to the lower of cost or realizable value 
historically  write downs for the net realizable value of inventories have not been significant  and we do not expect them to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations in the future 
however  if actual demand and market conditions turn out to be less favorable 
table of contents than those we projected in our evaluations of the net realizable value of inventories  additional write downs may be required 
environmental liabilities our manufacturing facilities are subject to a broad array of environmental laws and regulations in the countries in which they operate 
the costs to comply with complex environmental laws and regulations are significant and will continue for the foreseeable future 
we expense these recurring costs as they are incurred 
while these costs may increase in the future  they are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
we also accrue for environmental remediation costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount 
we determine the timing and amount of any liability based upon assumptions regarding future events 
inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown conditions  changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability  and evolving technologies 
we adjust these liabilities periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available 
because of these inherent uncertainties with respect to environmental remediation costs  potential liabilities could increase significantly from the million recorded as of december   due to adverse changes in circumstances 
at december   our consolidated balance sheet included an accrued liability for environmental remediation costs of million compared with million at december  of the million accrued liability at december   approximately was reserved for facilities outside of the us of the amounts accrued  million at december   and million at december   related to superfund sites 
income taxes the breadth of our operations and complexity of income tax regulations require us to assess uncertainties and make judgments in estimating the ultimate amount of income taxes we will pay 
the final income taxes we pay are based upon many factors  including existing income tax laws and regulations  negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  outcomes of tax litigation and resolution of disputes arising from federal  state  and international income tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties may result in adjustments to our income tax assets and liabilities in the future 
deferred income taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and we adjust our deferred income tax assets and liabilities for changes in income tax rates and income tax laws when changes are enacted 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred income tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the need for and the magnitude of appropriate valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets 
the realization of these assets is dependent on generating future taxable income  our ability to carry back or carry forward net operating losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  as well as successful implementation of various tax strategies to generate taxable income where net operating losses or credit carryforwards exist 
in evaluating our ability to realize the deferred income tax assets  we rely principally on forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences and the availability of tax planning strategies 
we earn a significant portion of our pre tax income outside the us many of these us tax jurisdictions have statutory income tax rates that are lower than that in the us because we carry a majority of our debt in the us  we also have significant cash needs in the us to service this debt 
as a result  it is necessary for us to perform significant tax and treasury planning and analysis to determine the best actions to achieve the goals of meeting our us cash needs  while also reducing our worldwide taxable income 
in this tax and treasury planning  we consider future taxable income in the us and non us jurisdictions  future cash needs in the non us  and the timing and amount of dividend repatriations 
our ability to balance future taxable income and cash flows between the us and foreign locations depends on various strategies  such as the charging of management fees for intercompany services  transfer pricing  intercompany royalties  intercompany sales of technologies and intellectual property  and choosing between allowable tax methods 

table of contents pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor defined benefit plans in the us and many countries outside the us  and we also sponsor retiree medical benefits for a segment of our salaried and hourly work force within the us the us pension plans represent approximately of pension plan assets  of benefit obligations and of net periodic pension cost 
the measurement dates used to determine pension and other postretirement benefit measurements are september th for the us plans and december st for the plans outside the us the assumptions we use in actuarial calculations for these plans have a significant impact on benefit obligations and annual net periodic benefit costs 
we meet with our actuaries annually to discuss key economic assumptions used to develop these benefit obligations and net periodic costs 
in accordance with us gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we determine the discount rate for the us pension and retiree medical plans based on a bond model 
using the pension plans projected cash flows  the bond model considers all possible bond portfolios that produce matching cash flows and selects the portfolio with the highest possible yield 
these portfolios are based on bonds with a quality rating of aa or better under either moody s or s p 
the discount rates for the non us plans are based on a yield curve method  using aa rated bonds applicable in respective capital markets 
the duration of each plan s liabilities is used to select the rate from the yield curve corresponding to the same duration 
we then round the resulting yields to the nearest basis points 
we calculate the expected return on assets at the beginning of the year for defined benefit plans as the weighted average of the expected return for the target allocation of the principal asset classes held by each of the plans 
our target asset allocation percentages are bonds and equity securities for us plans and bonds  equity securities  and other investments for non us plans 
in determining the expected returns  we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long term rates of return 
the resulting expected returns are then rounded to the nearest basis points 
the actual rate of return in was for us plans and for non us plans 
future actual pension expense will depend on future investment allocation and performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
all other assumptions are reviewed periodically by our actuaries and us and may be adjusted based on current trends and expectations as well as past experience in the plans 
the following table provides the sensitivity of net annual periodic benefit costs for our pension plans  including a us nonqualified retirement plan  and the retiree medical plan to a basis point decrease in both the discount rate and asset return assumption basis point decrease basis point decrease in asset return in discount rate assumption dollars in thousands us pension plans us retiree medical plan non us pension plans total

the amortization of net actuarial unrecognized gains or losses is a component of net periodic cost 
these gains or losses result from the difference between actual and assumed results and from changes in actuarial assumptions 
at december   our us and non us pension plans  including the nonqualified retirement plan  and our us retiree medical plan had unrecognized net losses of million 
we will recognize these unrecognized net losses in net periodic cost in future years  with an estimated million being recognized in as of december  we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  fas no 

as a result of our adoption of fas no 
 we recorded a decrease in other non current assets of million  an increase in accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million  a decrease in postretirement and pension liabilities of million  an increase in non current deferred tax assets of million  and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million 
during  we entered into an agreement to contingently make an additional contribution above the requirements of local statutory law to one international defined benefit plan if we terminate the participants in the plan prior to december  we may avoid the additional contribution if we transfer the participants and their accrued benefits to a third party 
we would be required to make an additional contribution of million should we terminate these participants in  declining to million should we terminate them in our overall net periodic benefit cost for all defined benefit plans decreased approximately million from to  primarily due to million in expense reductions relating to the changes in our defined benefit pension and retiree medical plans as described below 
this reduction in expense for was offset by a million charge related primarily to a lump sum settlement payment to the beneficiary of our deceased former chief executive officer from our nonqualified defined benefit retirement plan 
also as a result of these actions we reduced our additional minimum pension liability by million  net of tax  as a credit to other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
in april  we froze the retirement benefits for our largest us defined benefit pension plan that covers certain salaried and hourly employees 
this change in benefits does not affect current retirees or former employees 
we now provide the affected employees with retirement benefits through our defined contribution plan that provides us with more predictable benefit costs 
this change should reduce annual pension costs by million for the next several years 
additionally  we limited eligibility for the retiree medical and life insurance coverage for all nonunion employees 
only employees age or older with or more years of service as of december   are now eligible for post retirement medical and life insurance benefits 
moreover  these benefits will be available only to those employees who retire by december   after having advised the company of their retirement plans by march  this change does not affect current retirees benefits 
this change should reduce annual costs by million for the next several years 

table of contents in november  we announced that we will be closing our manufacturing facility in niagara falls  new york by the end of in the first quarter of  we will record a net curtailment loss of million for pension benefits related to this closing 
we will also record a net curtailment gain of approximately million for other benefits for the closing  but the timing and eventual amount depend on when employees are terminated 
as a result of this action  our annual net periodic benefit cost will be reduced by approximately million 
restructuring and cost reduction programs during  we developed and initiated several restructuring programs across a number of our business segments with the objectives of leveraging our global scale  realigning and lowering our cost structure and optimizing capacity utilization 
the programs are primarily associated with north america and europe 
management continues to evaluate our business  and therefore  there may be supplemental provisions for new plan initiatives as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made or actions are completed 
significant restructuring programs are described below 
the majority of initiatives begun in and prior are substantially completed 
in total  we recorded million of pre tax restructuring charges in as compared with million of pre tax charges during all of the charges related to severance benefits for employees affected by plant closings or capacity reduction  as well as various personnel in administrative or shared service functions 
the charges included both termination benefits and asset writedowns 
we estimated accruals for termination benefits based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions  local legal requirements  projected final service dates  and salary levels 
we also analyzed the carrying value of long lived assets and recorded estimated accelerated depreciation through for the assets affected by the restructuring 
in all likelihood  this accelerated depreciation will result in reducing the net book value of those assets to zero at the date operations cease 
while we believe that changes to our estimates are unlikely  the accuracy of our estimates depends on the successful completion of numerous actions 
delays in moving continuing operations to other facilities or increased cash outlays will increase our restructuring costs to such an extent that it could have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
other events  for example  a delay in completion of construction of new facilities  may also delay the resulting cost savings 
for the european restructurings initiated in  we established a goal of million to million in annual cost savings by the end of  with the full benefits realized in the initial phase of restructuring efforts began in july and targeted our performance coatings and color and glass performance materials segments in our european operations with an annual cost savings goal of million 
this restructuring should result in significant manufacturing efficiencies and will contribute to increased production capacity to support our revenue growth 
the current actions taking place are a consolidation of our cassiglie  italy  manufacturing operations and administrative functions  as well as the consolidation of decoration and certain color manufacturing operations from frankfurt  germany  into a european center of excellence in colditz  germany 
we are in consultation with various works councils regarding the effects of these restructuring programs 
we estimate the total termination benefits for the employees affected by the european restructuring to be approximately million to million 
we recorded million of termination benefits related to this action during  and we expect to record an additional million to million in we also recorded million of impairment charges for equipment made obsolete due to this plan 
a second restructuring program involves our electronic materials segment and will result in the closing of our manufacturing facilities in niagara falls  new york by the end of this action is expected to result in annual cost reduction of approximately million 
as part of the restructuring activities  we will redistribute the production at that facility to other existing electronic materials manufacturing facilities and we anticipate that we will reduce our workforce by employees  net of an estimated addition of employees at locations to which production will be transferred 
of the employees who will be terminated  are represented by a union 
we believe 
table of contents that the total estimated restructuring costs will be approximately million 
in the table below  we have summarized the charges recorded during and the estimated future charges to be incurred related to this action estimated charges charges incurred to be incurred in dollars in thousands asset impairments fixed assets intellectual property termination benefits other total we are currently in negotiation with the union that represents the hourly workers in our niagara falls  new york manufacturing plant to determine termination benefits as the result of the closing 
we accrued the estimated termination costs based upon our current contract with the union 
revenue recognition we recognize sales typically when we ship goods to our customers and when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed and determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
because we sell our many products throughout the world  we use varying sales and payments terms as agreed to with our customers 
in the us  our standard payment terms vary by industry and business unit  but are generally to days 
substantial amounts of our consolidated revenues are derived from foreign countries and in many of those countries the standard payment terms are longer than those prevalent in the us in order to ensure the revenue recognition in the proper period  we review material sales contracts for proper cut off based upon the business practices and legal requirements of each country 
for sales of products containing precious metals  we report revenues gross with a separate display of cost of sales to arrive at gross profit 
we record revenues this way because we act as the principal in the transactions we enter into and take title and the risks and rewards of ownership of the inventory we process  although the timing of when we take title to the inventory during the production process may vary 
the amount of shipping and handling fees invoiced to our customers at the time our product is shipped is included in net sales 
shipping and handling fees included in net sales were million in and million in credit memos issued to customers for sales returns  discounts allowed and sales adjustments are recorded when they are incurred as a reduction of sales 
we use estimated allowances to provide for future sales returns and adjustments in order to record revenues in the proper accounting period and to state the related accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
we estimate these allowances based upon historical sales return and adjustment rates 
actual allowances may be more or less than the amount we estimate 
in the past these differences have not been material and we do not expect any material differences in the future 
additionally  we provide certain of our customer with incentive rebate programs to promote customer loyalty and encourage greater product sales 
we accrue customer rebates over the rebate periods based upon estimated attainments of the provisions in the rebate agreements using available information and record these rebate accruals as reductions of sales 
we incurred million of customer rebates in and million in we do not expect customer rebates to increase significantly in future periods 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangibles while goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives recorded on our balance sheet are no longer amortized  we review these assets for impairment each year on a measurement date of october st 
we estimate the fair value of each business unit using a discounted cash flow method based on historical results and trends and our projections of market growth  internal sales efforts  input cost movements  and cost reduction opportunities 
we then allocate certain corporate expenses  assets and liabilities to the business units in this process 
using a risk adjusted  weighted average cost of capital  we discount the cash flow projections to measurement date 
if the fair value of any of the units were determined to be less than its carrying value  we would proceed to the second step and obtain comparable market values or independent appraisals of its assets to determine the amount of any impairment 
our estimates of fair value can be affected by a variety of factors 
reductions in actual or projected growth or profitability due to unfavorable market conditions in our business units  or significant increases in previous levels of capital spending  could lead to the impairment of any related goodwill 
additionally  an increase in inflation  interest rates or the risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital could also lead to a reduction in the value of one or more of our business units and therefore lead to the impairment of goodwill 
assessment of long lived assets our long lived assets include property  plant  equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we depreciate property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we continually assess long lived assets for the appropriateness of their estimated useful lives 
when circumstances indicate that there has been a reduction in the economic useful life of an asset or an asset group  we revise our estimates 
as discussed above  in we shortened our estimates of the useful lives for several asset groups due to our restructuring activities 
we also review property  plant and equipment and intangibles for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the undiscounted net cash flows to be generated by their use and eventual disposition are less than the assets recorded value 
in the event of impairment  we recognize a loss for the excess of the recorded value of the asset over its fair value 
the long term nature of these assets requires that we estimate cash inflows and outflows for several years into the future and only take into consideration technological advances known at the time of impairment 
due to depressed conditions in the electronics industry in late and in  we specifically evaluated our electronics assets in holland 
also in  we evaluated our italian tile and belgian polymer additives manufacturing assets because of sluggish market conditions in these regions 
in each situation  we concluded that the assets were not impaired 
in  we recorded impairment charges for both property  plant and equipment and intangibles due to the restructuring activities discussed above 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business to manage our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
the accounting for derivative financial instruments can be complex and require significant judgments 
generally  the derivative financial instruments that we use are not complex and quoted market prices are available through financial institutions 
we do not engage in speculative transactions for trading purposes 
financial instruments  including derivative financial instruments  expose us to counterparty credit risk for non performance 
we manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through minimum credit standards and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we enter into these derivative financial instruments with major reputable multinational financial institutions 
accordingly  we do not anticipate counter party default 
we continuously evaluate the effectiveness of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges to ensure that they are highly effective 
in the event the hedge becomes ineffective  we discontinue hedge treatment 
we manage foreign currency risks in a wide variety of foreign currencies principally by entering into forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions arising from international trade 
our objective in entering into these forward contracts is to preserve the economic value of non functional currency cash 
table of contents flows 
our principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  the british pound sterling  the japanese yen  and the chinese yuan 
we mark these forward contracts to fair value at the end of each reporting period and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other income or expense from foreign currency transactions 
we recorded mark to market losses from forward currency contracts of million in and mark to market gains of million in the amounts of gains or losses we record depend on a variety of factors including the notional amount of the forward contracts entered into and the fluctuation of the underlying currency exchange rates 
we do not expect any change in our foreign currency risk policies or in the nature of the transactions were enter into to mitigate foreign currency risk 
our exposure to market risk from commodity prices relate primarily to commodity raw materials and energy used in the production of a portion of our products 
we purchase portions of our natural gas requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of cost changes 
for contracts entered into prior to april  we marked these contracts to fair value and recognized the resulting gains or losses as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
beginning april  we designated new natural gas contracts as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
during  we recognized million in mark to market losses and in we recognized million in mark to market gains 
due to the designation of these contracts as normal purchase contracts  we do not expect to recognize mark to market gains or losses in future periods 
our purchase commitments for natural gas under normal purchase contracts was million at december   for million mbtus 
we also manage a portion of our exposure to market risk for changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities using derivative instruments 
we hedge our exposure principally through swap arrangements that allow us to fix the price of the commodities for future purchases 
these swap arrangements are settled in cash at their maturities 
we mark these contracts to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as other comprehensive income 
after the contracts mature and the materials are sold  the gains and losses are recognized as a part of cost of sales 
during  we recognized million of net gains in cost of sales related to the settlement of these swaps 
for  the amount was not material 
at december   million of gains remained in other comprehensive income and inventories 
we do not expect any change in our commodity risk policies or in the nature of the transactions we enter into to mitigate commodity market risk

fas no 
is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this statement  at this time  we are uncertain as to the impact on our results of operations and financial position 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risks is generally limited to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and costs of raw materials and natural gas 
our exposure to interest rate risk arises from our debt portfolio 
we manage this risk by controlling the mix of fixed versus variable rate debt after considering the interest rate environment and expected future cash flows 
our objective is to limit the negative effect of rising interest rates on earnings  cash flows and overall borrowing costs  while preserving flexibility and allowing us to benefit during periods of falling rates 
in  our level of fixed rate debt decreased and variable rate debt increased 
as we anticipated and planned for  during july and august  bondholders accelerated the payment of the principal amount of the company s fixed rate debentures  of which million was outstanding 
the debentures were repaid through use of the variable rate term loan facility 
we operate internationally and enter into transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
these transactions expose us to gains and losses arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled 
we manage this risk by entering into forward currency contracts that offset these gains and losses 
we are also subject to cost changes with respect to our raw materials and natural gas purchases 
we attempt to mitigate raw materials cost increases with price increases to our customers 
we also hedge a portion of our exposure to changes in the pricing of certain raw material commodities using derivative financial instruments 
we hedge our exposure principally through swap arrangements that allow us to fix the pricing of the commodities for future purchases 
in addition  we purchase portions of our natural gas requirements under fixed price contracts to reduce the volatility of this cost 
for contracts entered into prior to april  we mark these contracts to fair value and recognize the resulting gains or losses as miscellaneous income or expense  respectively 
beginning april  we designated new natural gas contracts as normal purchase contracts  which are not marked to market 
our purchase commitment for natural gas under normal purchase contracts was million at december
