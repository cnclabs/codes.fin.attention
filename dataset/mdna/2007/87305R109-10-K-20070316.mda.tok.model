we present ebitda to enhance the understanding of our operating results 
ebitda is a key measure we use to evaluate our operations 
ebitda is also a key component in two of our debt covenant calculations for under credit agreement  the leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 
however  the ebitda amount determined under our credit agreement is further adjusted to exclude certain transaction costs and other non cash charges see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we provide our ebitda because we believe that investors and securities analysts will find ebitda to be a useful measure for evaluating our operating performance and comparing our operating performance with that of similar companies that have different capital structures and for evaluating our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements 
however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to net income as a measure of operating results in accordance with accounting principals generally accepted in the united states

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a one stop provider of time critical and technologically complex printed circuit boards pcbs and backplane assemblies  which serve as the foundation of sophisticated electronic products 
we serve high end commercial and aerospace defense markets including the networking communications infrastructure  high end computing  defense  aerospace and industrial medical markets which are characterized by high levels of complexity and moderate production volumes 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  electronic manufacturing services  or ems  providers and defense and aerospace companies 
our time to market and high technology focused manufacturing services enable our customers to reduce the time required to develop new products and bring them to market 
the market for our products experienced a sustained downturn during and  due to the economic slowdown in the electronics industry 
during this period  we reduced our work force and focused on cost reduction by improving the efficiency of our operations and negotiating lower prices on key supplies from our vendors 
throughout this period  we generated positive cash flow from operations  added new customers  and continued to invest in our future growth  adding capital equipment and acquiring advanced circuits in december during  we generated increased sales due to the inclusion of advanced circuits  market share gains  and the improving economic conditions in the electronics industry and our customers end markets 
our gross profit margin also increased from to  due to our improved operating leverage as costs that are largely fixed in nature  such as labor  were absorbed over greater production volume 
market conditions continued to improve in  resulting in further revenue growth and expanded gross margins 
during the first half of  prices for our printed circuit boards declined leading to lower revenue and gross margins 
however  prices as well as production volume increased during the second half of and in  leading to increased revenue and expanded gross margins 
on october   we completed the acquisition of pcg from tyco international ltd 
the total purchase price of this acquisition was million  excluding acquisition costs 
this acquisition enhanced our business in the following ways positioned us as the largest pcb fabricator in north america as well as the largest pcb fabricator in the defense and aerospace end market  added complementary commercial pcb fabrication facilities to our original three commercial pcb manufacturing sites  added global backplane and sub system assembly capability  entered the backplane assembly market in china with a facility in shanghai  expanded engineering and materials expertise  expanded and diversified our customer base 
we measure customers as those companies that have placed at least two orders in the preceding month period 
as of december   we had approximately customers and approximately as of december  sales to our largest customers accounted for of our net sales in and of our net sales in we sell to oems both directly and indirectly through ems companies 
sales attributable to our five largest oem customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in  of our net sales in and of our net sales in the following table shows the percentage of our net sales attributable to each of the principal end markets we served for the periods indicated 
because of the significant increase in aerospace defense business due to the recent acquisition of pcg  we have modified our end market classifications to more accurately portray our resulting customer base 

table of contents year ended december  end markets networking communications computing storage peripherals medical industrial instrumentation other aerospace defense total sales to ems companies are classified by the end markets of their oem customers 
for pcbs we measure the time sensitivity of our products by tracking the quick turn percentage of our work 
we define quick turn orders as those with delivery times of days or less  which typically captures research and development  prototype  and new product introduction work  in addition to unexpected short term demand among our customers 
generally  we quote prices after we receive the design specifications and the time and volume requirements from our customers 
our quick turn services command a premium price as compared to standard lead time products 
quick turn orders decreased from approximately of net pcb sales in to of net pcb sales in  due to both higher demand for our standard lead time  high technology production services as well as the inclusion of the pcg facilities  which focus primarily on standard lead time services 
we also deliver a large percentage of compressed lead time work with lead times of to days 
we receive a premium price for this work as well 
purchase orders may be cancelled prior to shipment 
we charge customers a fee  based on percentage completed  if an order is cancelled once it has entered production 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss has transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
net sales consist of gross sales less an allowance for returns  which typically has been less than of gross sales 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards 
we record an amount for estimated sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on our historical results 
to the extent actual returns vary from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
cost of goods sold consists of materials  labor  outside services  and overhead expenses incurred in the manufacture and testing of our products as well as stock based compensation expense 
many factors affect our gross margin  including capacity utilization  product mix  production volume  and yield 
we do not participate in any significant long term contracts with suppliers  and we believe there are a number of potential suppliers for the raw materials we use 
we believe that our cost of goods sold will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions paid to our internal sales force and commissions paid to independent sales representatives  salaries paid to our sales support staff  stock based compensation expense as well as costs associated with marketing materials and trade shows 
we generally pay higher commissions to our independent sales representatives for quick turn work  which generally has a higher gross profit component than standard lead time work 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative costs primarily include the salaries for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as insurance expenses  expenses for accounting and legal assistance  incentive compensation expense  stock based compensation expense  and bad debt expense 
we expect these expenses to continue to fluctuate as a percentage of net sales as we add personnel and incur additional costs related to the growth of our business and the requirements of operating as a public company 
amortization of intangibles consists of intangible assets  which we recorded as a result of the power circuits acquisition in july as well as the pcg acquisition in october restructuring charges in relate to the final write down of assets held for sale associated with the sale of the burlington  washington  facility 
restructuring charges in relate to severance costs to terminate certain sales and administrative employees of the acquiring entity following the pcg acquisition 

table of contents our interest expense relates to our senior secured credit facility and our other long term obligations 
amortization of debt issuance costs consists of the amortization of loan origination fees and related legal and administrative expenses 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest received on our cash and short term investment balances 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  the use of independent valuation firms and licensed environmental professionals  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
accounting policies for which significant judgments and estimates are made include asset valuation related to bad debts and inventory obsolescence  sales returns and allowances  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  realizability of deferred tax assets  establishing the fair value of individual assets acquired and individual liabilities assumed when we acquire other businesses  determining stock based compensation expense  self insured medical reserves  asset retirement obligations and environmental liabilities 
a detailed description of these estimates and our policies to account for them is included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in this report 
we provide customary credit terms to our customers and generally do not require collateral 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical collections experience and expected collectibility of accounts 
our actual bad debts may differ from our estimates 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare these with current and committed inventory levels 
provision is made to reduce excess and obsolete inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
our inventory requirements may change based on our projected customer demand  changes due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes  longer or shorter than expected usage periods and other factors that could affect the valuation of our inventories 
we maintain certain finished goods inventories near certain key customer locations in accordance with agreements 
although this inventory is typically supported by valid purchase orders  should these customers ultimately not purchase these inventories  our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we derive revenues primarily from the sale of printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies using customer supplied engineering and design plans and recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the sales terms are fixed and determinable  title and risk of loss have transferred  and collectibility is reasonably assured generally when products are shipped to the customer 
we provide our customers a limited right of return for defective printed circuit boards and backplane assemblies 
we accrue an estimated amount for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based on historical information 
to the extent actual experience varies from our historical experience  revisions to these allowances may be required 
we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets consisting of property  plant and equipment  goodwill  and definite lived intangibles 
we review these assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in addition  we perform an impairment test related to goodwill at least annually 
our goodwill and intangibles are largely attributable to our acquisitions of other businesses 
during the fourth fiscal quarter  we performed an impairment assessment of our goodwill  which requires the use of a fair value based analysis and determined that no impairment existed 
at december   we determined that there were no events or changes in circumstances that indicated that the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we use an estimate of the future undiscounted net cash flows in measuring whether our long lived tangible assets and definite lived intangible assets are recoverable 
if forecasts and assumptions used to support the realizability of our long lived assets change in the future  significant impairment charges could result that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
deferred income tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
at december   we have net deferred income tax assets of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of approximately million 
should our expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may be necessary to adjust our valuation allowance  which could affect our results of operations in the period such a determination is made 
in addition  we record income tax provision or benefit during interim periods at a rate that is based on expected results for the full year 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred income tax assets would be realizable in an amount greater than what already is recorded  we would reverse all or a portion of valuation allowance in the period the determination is made 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results for the year to be more or less favorable than those expected  adjustments to the effective income tax rate could be required 

table of contents we apply the provisions of purchase accounting when recording our acquisitions 
application of purchase accounting requires that we estimate the fair value of the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed of a business 
determination of the fair value of the assets involves a number of judgments and estimates 
in our acquisitions to date  we have engaged an outside valuation firm to provide us with an appraisal report  which we utilized in determining the purchase price allocation 
the allocation of the purchase price to different asset classes impacts the depreciation and amortization expense we subsequently record 
the principal assets we have acquired to date are receivables  inventory  real estate  property and equipment  as well as intangible assets such as customer relationships 
the principal liabilities we have assumed to date are payables  asset retirement obligations and future environmental remediation obligations 
the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisition of tyco printed circuit group has not been finalized and is subject to change pending the receipt of additional information necessary to finalize the fair values of accounts receivables  sales returns and allowances  property  plant and equipment  asset retirement obligations  environmental reserves  and certain contingent liabilities 
the additional information includes among other items  adequate support for certain credits in the accounts receivable  completion of a final compilation of property and equipment due to the incompleteness of the records acquired  completion of the appraisals being obtained on certain property and equipment  and information being obtained to finalize the values of asset retirement obligations  environmental reserves and certain contingent liabilities 
the company will continue to obtain the necessary information to finalize the fair values of these items during and may make further purchase accounting adjustments if appropriate which would primarily affect the amount of goodwill that we recorded 
we establish liabilities for the costs of asset retirement obligations when a legal or contractual obligation exists to dispose of or restore an asset upon its retirement and the timing and cost of such work is reasonably estimable 
we record such liabilities only when such timing and costs are reasonably determinable 
in addition  we accrue an estimate of the undiscounted costs of environmental remediation for work at identified sites where an assessment has indicated it is probable that cleanup costs are or will be required and may be reasonably estimated 
in making these estimates  we consider information that is currently available  existing technology  enacted laws and regulations  and our estimates of the timing of the required remedial actions  and we discount these estimates at 
we may use outside environmental consultants to assist us in making these estimates 
we also are required to estimate the amount of any probable recoveries  including insurance recoveries 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r share based payments sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method we recognize compensation expense for all share based payments granted on and after january   and prior but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award using a straight line method 
prior to sfas no 
r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore we generally recognized compensation expense only when we granted options with an exercise price below the market price on the date of grant 
we estimate the value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the share based payment awards and expected stock price volatility 
the expected term represents the average time that options that vest are expected to be outstanding 
the expected volatility rates are estimated based on a weighted average of the historical volatilities of our common stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
we have currently estimated our forfeiture rate to be percent 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
for the year ended december   share based compensation expense was million 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we are self insured for group health insurance benefits provided to our employees  and we purchase insurance to protect against claims at the individual and aggregate level 
the insurance carrier adjudicates and processes employee claims and is paid a fee for these services 
we reimburse our insurance carrier for paid claims subject to variable monthly limitations 
we estimate our exposure for claims incurred but not paid at the end of each reporting period and use historical information supplied by our insurance carrier and broker to estimate our liability for these claims 
this liability is subject to an aggregate stop loss that varies based on employee enrollment and factors that are established at each annual contract renewal 
our actual claims experience may differ from our estimates 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling and marketing general and administrative amortization of definite lived intangibles restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense amortization of debt issuance costs interest income and other  net total other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax benefit provision benefit net income business segments the company has two reportable segments pcb manufacturing and commercial assembly 
prior to our acquisition of pcg we had one reportable segment 
these reportable segments are managed separately because they distribute and manufacture distinct products with different production processes 
pcb manufacturing fabricates printed circuit boards 
commercial assembly is a contract manufacturing business that specializes in assembling backplanes into subassemblies and other complete electronic devices 
pcb manufacturing customers are either ems companies or oem companies  while commercial assembly customers are usually oems 
our commercial assembly segment includes our hayward  california and shanghai  china plants and our ireland sales and distribution infrastructure 
our pcb manufacturing segment is composed of nine domestic pcb fabrication plants and an assembly operation that is closely affiliated with one of the pcb manufacturing plants 
we evaluate each segment on the basis of segment profits  which excludes profit on inter segment sales  certain interest income and expense  and income tax expense 
corporate expenses and certain centrally managed expenses are allocated to each segment 
the following table presents sales and operating income for our reportable segments 
for further information regarding our reportable segments  refer to note to our consolidated financial statements

net sales net sales increased million  or  from million in to million in due to several factors  including the addition of the pcg facilities  and both increased prices and production volume at the three original ttm technologies plants 
of the million increase in sales  million resulted from our pcg acquisition  including million from the commercial assembly segment 
volume increased approximately primarily due to higher demand from our customers for our products 
prices rose approximately due to increased demand for pcbs as well as a shift in production mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which generally is characterized by higher prices  decreased from of pcb revenue in to of pcb revenue in due to both higher demand for our standard lead time  high technology production services as well as the inclusion of the pcg facilities  which focus primarily on standard lead time services 
gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for cost of goods sold rose due to several factors  including the addition of the pcg facilities  and both increased material prices and production volume at the three original ttm technologies plants 
adding to this increase was higher repair and maintenance costs  higher utilities costs and higher depreciation expense 
the increase in cost of goods sold included approximately million for the value of the manufacturing profit added to the pcg inventories at the acquisition date 
in addition  higher wage rates  greater headcount  increased incentive compensation and the inclusion of stock option expense led to increased labor costs 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold decreased from for to for primarily due to increased pricing and greater absorption of fixed costs due to increased production 
as a result of the foregoing  gross profit increased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin increased from in to in the increase in our gross margin was due to higher sale prices for our products as well as lower cost of goods sold as a percent of sales  which increased due to the factors discussed above  partially offset by assembly sales  which have inherently lower gross margins 
this increase in gross margin was fueled by increased absorption of fixed costs due to increased production 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes 
as production increases  our employees are able to work more efficiently and produce more printed circuit boards without incurring significant cost increases 
however  at higher capacity utilization rates  additional employees and capital may be required

general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to greater absorption of these costs over a larger revenue base 
in the fourth fiscal quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to realigning certain sales and administrative functions 
other income expense other income expense declined million from income of million in to income of million in this net decrease resulted from an increase of million in interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs related to our new million senior secured term loan used to fund the acquisition of pcg  net of an increase of million from interest earned on higher balances in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments for most of income taxes the provision for income taxes increased from a million benefit for to a million provision for the change from an income tax benefit in to an income tax provision in resulted from a favorable valuation allowance adjustment in  higher pretax income in  and a higher effective tax rate for our effective tax benefit rate was in  and our effective tax provision rate was in our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items

our expectations of future earnings were sufficient for us to conclude that it was more likely than not that most of our deferred income tax assets will be realized 
excluding the favorable impacts to our tax provision resulting from the decreases in our valuation allowance in  our effective tax rate in was 
the increase from this rate to the effective tax rate of is due primarily to the acquisition of the pcg facilities  which are generally in states with higher tax rates  most notably california 
our federal tax rate also increased from in to in as of december   our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was approximately million 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  net sales net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in due to declining prices  partially offset by an increase in production volume 
volume increased approximately primarily due to higher demand from our customers for our products 
prices fell approximately primarily due to increased competition and excess capacity in the north american printed circuit board industry  partially offset by a shift in product mix toward more high technology production 
our quick turn production  which generally is characterized by higher prices  increased from of revenue in to of revenue in gross profit cost of goods sold increased million  or  from million for to million for cost of goods sold rose due to an increase in the number of printed circuit boards sold as well as price increases in raw materials  higher repair and maintenance costs  higher utilities costs  primarily natural gas  and higher depreciation expense 
in addition  higher wage rates and greater headcount led to increased labor costs  but these increases were partially offset by a reduced incentive compensation accrual

as a result of the foregoing  gross profit decreased million  or  from million for to million for our gross margin decreased from in to in 
table of contents the decline in our gross margin was due to lower prices for our products as well as higher cost of goods sold  which increased due to the factors discussed above 
this decline in gross margin was somewhat mitigated by increased absorption of fixed costs due to increased production 
printed circuit board manufacturing is a multi step process that requires a certain level of equipment and staffing for even minimal production volumes

the mix of selling and marketing expenses did not change significantly from to general and administrative expenses increased million from million  or of net sales  for to million  or of net sales  for the increase in expenses resulted primarily from a net million loss contingency accrual related to reaching a definitive agreement with a customer to resolve a dispute concerning certain goods shipped in and  higher accounting fees for the audit of internal control over financial reporting required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  and higher labor expense due to higher wage rates  partially offset by lower incentive compensation expense and costs related to a proposed public stock offering in the second fiscal quarter general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the net increase in expenses described in this paragraph 
in the second fiscal quarter  we recorded a restructuring charge of million to write down the value of our burlington  washington building prior to selling it 
we subsequently sold it in the fourth fiscal quarter other income expense other income expense improved million from income of million in to income of million in this increase resulted from higher interest income due to higher cash and short term investment balances and higher interest rates in as compared to as well as lower interest expense in due to the repayment of our term loan in income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased from a million provision for to a million benefit for the change from an income tax provision in to an income tax benefit in resulted from lower pretax income in combined with a lower effective tax rate for our effective tax provision rate was in and our effective tax benefit rate was in our effective tax rate is primarily impacted by the federal income tax rate  apportioned state income tax rates  utilization of other credits and deductions available to us  and certain non deductible items

the reduction in valuation allowance in occurred during the fourth quarter given the additional positive evidence from continued historical earnings and expectations of future earnings which was sufficient for us to conclude that it was more likely than not that most of our deferred income tax assets will be realized 
excluding the favorable impacts to our tax provision resulting from the decreases in our valuation allowance in and  our effective tax rate in was and in as of december   our valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  and proceeds from employee exercises of stock options 
our principal uses of cash have been to finance acquisitions  meet debt service requirements  finance capital expenditures and fund working capital requirements 
we anticipate that servicing debt  funding working capital requirements and financing capital expenditures will continue to be the principal demands on our cash in the future 
on october   we completed the pcg acquisition for million  excluding acquisition costs 
this purchase price was paid using some of our available cash and cash equivalents as well as proceeds from a new million senior secured term loan 
we cancelled our existing million revolving credit facility and replaced it with a new million senior secured revolving credit facility 
as of december   we had net working capital of approximately million  compared to million as of december  the increase in working capital is primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable and inventories largely due to consolidation of the acquired entity s balance sheet and partially offset by the classification of a significant portion of 
table of contents our long term debt as a current liability in on october   we used million of our cash and cash equivalents to fund a portion of the price paid for pcg plus direct acquisition and debt issuance costs 
our capital expenditure plan is expected to total approximately million and will fund capital equipment purchases to increase capacity and expand our technological capabilities throughout our facilities 
the following table provides information on contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating leases purchase obligations capital lease obligations debt obligations interest on debt obligations total contractual obligations for variable rate debt  interest is based upon the rates in effect at december   adjusted for the impact of our interest rate hedge entered into january  in connection with the pcg acquisition  the company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to environmental remediation at two connecticut sites and is obligated to investigate a third connecticut site 
the company currently estimates that it will incur remediation costs of million to million over the next to months related to these matters 
in addition  the company has obligations to the connecticut department of environmental protection to complete a compliance management plan through july under which the company will make certain environmental asset improvements to its waste water systems  which are estimated to cost million 
based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations  available cash and amounts available under a new five year senior secured million revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our currently anticipated debt service  capital expenditure  and working capital needs for the next months and beyond 
our principal liquidity needs for periods beyond the next months are to meet debt service requirements as well as for other contractual obligations as indicated in our contractual obligations table above and for capital purchases under our annual capital expenditure plan

the closure of the dallas facility is expected to be completed during the second quarter of after which the company will commence the process of selling the building and certain assets 
we anticipate that we will also incur additional costs of approximately million related to transferring certain equipment and closing the facility which will be expensed as incurred
