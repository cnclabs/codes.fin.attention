item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing products which can provide improved efficacy  safety or patient convenience in the treatment of acute and chronic pain and pain related conditions 
we operate a business model that focuses on the following obtaining patents for innovative ideas which we believe have value in the marketplace  utilizing a small group of talented employees to develop those ideas through proof of concept by working with strategic outsource partners  licensing the resulting product or technology to a strong pharmaceutical partner to commercialize 
we hire experts with strong project management skills in the specific disciplines we believe are important to maintain within our company 
we contract with and manage strong outsource partners as we complete the necessary development work  permitting us to avoid incurring the cost of buying or building laboratories  manufacturing facilities or clinical research operation sites 
this allows us to control our annual expenses  but to utilize best in class resources as required 
after we establish the proof of concept for an innovative idea  we work with the fda or foreign regulatory agencies to design a clear path forward to the filing of a new drug application nda or its foreign equivalent 
we then seek a strong pharmaceutical partner to license the product or technology  to collaborate with us in the remaining development and to commercialize the product or technology after approval 
the success of our business is highly dependent on the market place value of our ideas and the related patents we obtain  our ability to obtain from the required regulatory agencies approval to sell the developed products and our ability to find strong commercial partners to successfully commercialize the products 
we are currently developing trexima tm in collaboration with glaxosmithkline gsk 
trexima is gsk s proposed brand name for the combination of sumatriptan succinate  formulated with gsk s rt technology tm  and naproxen sodium in a single tablet designed for the acute treatment of migraine 
trexima incorporates our mt technology  which refers to our proprietary combinations of a triptan ht 
b d 
agonist and a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid 
under our mt technology  we seek to develop product candidates that provide acute migraine therapy by combining the activity of two drugs that act by different mechanisms to reduce the pain and associated symptoms of migraine 
we filed a new drug application nda for trexima with the us food and drug administration fda in august and in june  we received an approvable letter requiring us to provide certain additional safety information relating to trexima  some of which required new studies 
an approvable letter is an official notification from the fda that contains conditions that must be satisfied prior to obtaining final us marketing approval 
we  along with gsk  met with the fda in july to discuss the approvable letter and we submitted a response to the fda s approvable letter in november in december  the fda told us that our response was not a complete submission and requested that we provide additional analyses and supporting information relating to the data we submitted in our november response 
the fda also indicated that it is necessary to provide a complete and accurate presentation of these data  which must sufficiently address their safety concerns  including cardiovascular safety 
we worked with gsk to compile and format the additional data requested by the fda and delivered a revised full response to the fda in early february if the fda accepts this revised response as complete  we expect that the fda will complete its review and issue an action letter within six months of the submission 
we are also developing product candidates that combine a type of acid inhibitor  a proton pump inhibitor ppi  with an nsaid our pn program 
these product candidates are intended to provide management of pain and inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis  and are intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an nsaid taken alone 
in august  we entered into an exclusive global collaboration and license agreement with astrazeneca ab astrazeneca to co develop and commercialize proprietary fixed dose combinations of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen  in a single tablet using our pn formulation technology 
another product candidate program our pa program  a combination of a ppi and aspirin  is currently in formulation and clinical development testing 
our pa product candidates are not covered under our agreement with astrazeneca 
in addition  we are exploring the development of product candidates containing lornoxicam  an nsaid that is currently marketed outside the us including europe and japan to treat pain or other pain related indications 
these product candidates  which are being developed under an exclusive license agreement with nycomed danmark aps nycomed  grant us certain rights to develop and commercialize products containing lornoxicam 
we have filed investigational new drug applications inds with the fda for an oral and an injectable lornoxicam formulation 
we are also conducting both formulation development and early stage clinical studies with new product concepts that are currently in the exploratory stage 
if warranted  we may file us and international patent applications with claims directed toward these novel combinations and formulations 

table of contents we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue from product sales 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for our product candidates and general and administrative expenses 
research and development expenses include salaries and benefits for personnel involved in our research and development activities and direct development costs  which include costs relating to the formulation and manufacturing of our product candidates  costs relating to preclinical studies  including toxicology studies  and clinical trials  and costs relating to compliance with regulatory requirements applicable to the development of our product candidates 
since inception  our research and development expenses have represented of our total operating expenses 
for the year ended december   our research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses 
statement of financial accounting standards board sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by development stage enterprises  states that an enterprise shall be considered to be in the development stage if either planned principal operations have not commenced or planned principal operations have commenced  but there has been no significant revenue therefrom 
we will remain a development stage company until such time as significant revenues have been generated from the marketing and sale of our product candidates 
we expect that we may continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete the development and seek regulatory approval for our product candidates  develop other product candidates and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of trexima  our pn and pa product candidates and our other product candidates in the clinical and regulatory process  the establishment of new collaborations and progress and or maintenance of our existing collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our product candidates  the acquisition and or in licensing  and development  of other therapeutic product candidates  and costs related to the pending class action lawsuit against us and our president and chief executive officer relating to the approvability of mt and mt we do not currently have commercialization or manufacturing capabilities 
we have entered into collaborations and currently plan to enter into additional collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates once approved 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with collaborators  to achieve the milestones set forth in our collaboration agreements  to enter into additional collaboration agreements  and successfully develop product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and successfully manufacture and commercialize our future products 
these milestones are earned when we have satisfied the criteria set out in our revenue recognition footnote accompanying the financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these payments generate large non recurring revenue that will cause large fluctuations in quarterly and annual profit and loss 
status and expenses related to our product candidates there follows a brief discussion of the status of the development of our product candidates  as well as the costs relating to our development activities 
our direct research and development expenses were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  our research and development expenses that are not direct development costs consist of personnel and other research and development departmental costs and are not allocated by product candidate 
we generally do not maintain records that allocate our employees time by the projects on which they work and  therefore  are unable to identify costs related to the time that employees spend on research and development by product candidate 
total compensation and benefit costs for our personnel involved in research and development were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  total compensation for included a million charge for non cash compensation for stock option expense resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r on january  other research and development department costs were million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the fiscal year ended december  trexima 
in june  we received an approvable letter from the fda related to the nda for trexima 
an approvable letter is an official notification from the fda that contains conditions that must be satisfied prior to obtaining final us marketing approval 
the approvable letter reflected that the fda has determined that trexima is effective as an acute treatment for migraine headaches 
the fda requested additional safety information on trexima  some of which required new studies 
after meeting with the fda in july  we and gsk submitted a response to the approvable letter in november using additional data from gsk sponsored clinical trials 
in december  we received notification that the response was not yet complete 
specifically  the fda requested 
table of contents that we provide additional analyses and supporting information relating to the data we submitted in our november response 
the fda also indicated that it is necessary to provide a complete and accurate presentation of these data  which must sufficiently address their safety concerns  including cardiovascular safety 
we worked with gsk to compile and format the additional data requested by the fda and delivered a revised full response to the fda in early february if the fda accepts such revised response as complete  we expect that the fda will complete its review within six months of this submission 
as part of our nda program for trexima  we conducted five phase trials  two phase pivotal trials  and one month open label safety trial using a formulation of trexima developed by gsk 
the phase pivotal trials  including the endpoints required to evaluate trexima  were designed to demonstrate superiority to placebo for relief of pain and the associated symptoms of migraine nausea  photophobia and phonophobia at two hours 
additionally  the program was designed to demonstrate that each component makes a contribution to the efficacy of trexima the combination drug rule that the fda requires of all combination products 
the efficacy endpoint for the combination was sustained pain free  which is defined as improvement from moderate or severe pain to no pain at two hours and remaining at no pain through twenty four hours without the use of rescue medicine 
further  gsk continues to conduct pre approval market support studies for trexima under our ind 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to obtain regulatory approval of trexima 
while we believe that we have provided a full response to the questions raised by the fda in the approvable letter  and we believe we have submitted adequate data to address the fda s concerns regarding the safety of trexima  there are no guarantees that the fda will find the submission to be satisfactory  that the fda will approve the nda  that additional testing will not be required prior to approval  or that additional warnings will not be required on the product labeling 
in the event that additional clinical trials or other research and development activities are required  under our agreement  gsk will be responsible for the costs of such additional trials or activities  except for our personnel related costs 
further  we have no assurance that gsk will continue with the development of the product in the event of additional delays in obtaining approval 
we incurred million in direct development costs associated with the development of mt trexima for the year ended december  and we have incurred million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
pn program 
under our pn program  we have completed formulation development and clinical studies for several combinations of a proton pump inhibitor ppi and an nsaid in a single tablet intended to provide effective management of pain and inflammation associated with chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis  and intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an nsaid taken alone in patients at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
to date  we have conducted studies with two pn product formulations in this program pn  a combination of the ppi lansoprazole and the nsaid naproxen  and pn  a combination of the ppi omeprazole and naproxen 
our future development and commercialization efforts under the pn program will be covered under our exclusive collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  which we entered into on august  under our agreement with astrazeneca  we and astrazeneca will co develop and astrazeneca will commercialize proprietary fixed dose combinations of the ppi esomeprazole magnesium with the nsaid naproxen  in a single tablet 
the initial product to be developed under the agreement  pn  is being studied for the management of pain and inflammation associated with conditions such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis in patients who are at risk for developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
in discussions with the fda during regarding our development plans for studies to pursue fda approval of pn and pn  the fda agreed that by including naproxen as the nsaid within the pn formulation  we could expect that all indications for use of naproxen in adults would accrue to the pn product  if clinical trials successfully demonstrated improved safety lower incidence of gastric ulcers of the pn product compared with naproxen alone and the pn formulation was shown to be bioequivalent to marketed formulations of naproxen 
prior to entering into our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we completed a study designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the naproxen component of our pn product candidate development formulation to enteric coated naproxen 
this study demonstrated that the pn formulation was bioequivalent to the reference drug  ec naprosyn 
in early  we submitted a special protocol assessment spa to the fda for our pivotal phase clinical trials for pn the spa is a process in which the fda provides evaluations and guidance on clinical trial protocols for pivotal phase clinical trials 
in april  we announced that we had reached an agreement with the fda on the phase pivotal clinical trials for pn for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis  rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in patients at risk of developing nsaid associated gastric ulcers 
we also reached agreement with the fda that the development program and study design proposed for pn would be applicable to a product that contained an isomer of omeprazole combined with naproxen 
in light of our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca  we  along with astrazeneca  
table of contents expect to meet with the fda during the second quarter of to confirm whether  notwithstanding the use of a different ppi  the core development program and the spa already agreed upon will apply to the new product consisting of proprietary fixed dose combinations of esomeprazole magnesium with naproxen 
in the third quarter of  we began recruiting subjects for a six month pn comparative trial using a combination of omeprazole and naproxen as compared to enteric coated naproxen in patients requiring chronic nsaid therapy 
the primary endpoint for the trial is the cumulative incidence of gastric ulcers over six months of treatment 
because we will not have final results until the fourth quarter of  we will review the preliminary results of this trial in the third quarter prior to commencing phase studies of pn if we and astrazeneca are satisfied that the pn trial will be successful based on our assessment of the preliminary data  and we have successfully completed a cross over gastric ph based dose ranging study for pn  we will begin our phase program for pn as soon as clinical trial material is manufactured and ready for use 
we currently expect to commence phase trials for pn in the third quarter of successful completion of the pn trial and the pn dose ranging trial described above would trigger a million milestone payment from astrazeneca 
according to the terms of the astrazeneca agreement and the current timeline  the earliest this milestone could be earned is december if one or both of these trials do not meet the pre specified primary endpoints  astrazeneca has the right to terminate the agreement within a specified timeframe 
if the agreement is not terminated within such timeframe  the collaboration would continue and the milestone would be payable 
in  we also had discussions with the fda concerning the implications of the fda s guidance issued in june concerning labeling of nsaid containing products  which resulted from an fda advisory committee meeting held in february the advisory committee addressed the safety of nsaids  and  in particular  the cardiovascular risks of cox selective nsaids 
based on our discussions with the fda reviewing division for pn products  we believe that  unless new information about naproxen safety concerns becomes available  long term cardiovascular safety studies will not be required at this time for fda approval of our pn product candidates containing naproxen 
however  we cannot guarantee that such studies will not be required 
we will continue to evaluate and review with the fda its expectations and recommendations regarding the efficacy and safety requirements and study design necessary to support approval of ndas for our pn and pa product candidates 
additionally  we have met with four national european regulatory agencies to discuss the proposed development program for pn 
while further clarification will be needed  based on the intention to develop the esomeprazole combination  further clinical studies  beyond those specifically required for the nda submission in the us  will likely need to be conducted 
in part  these studies will be required as the naproxen containing products on the european market differ in strength and formulation from those available in the us we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any pn product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any pn products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pn program of million during the fiscal year ended december   million during the fiscal year ended december   million during the fiscal year ended december  and we have incurred million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation or our overhead expenses 
pa program 
in our pa program  we are exploring the development of a combination of a ppi and aspirin in a single tablet 
similar to the pn program  our pa product candidate is intended to have fewer gastrointestinal complications compared to an aspirin taken alone  in patients at risk for developing aspirin associated gastric ulcers 
our pa product candidates are not covered under the astrazeneca agreement  and we have retained all rights to this program 
our initial pa product candidate  pa  is currently in formulation and early stage clinical development 
we completed a phase i proof of concept study of pa in the first quarter of the primary endpoint was gastrointestinal damage as measured by the lanza scoring system used in our previous pn studies 
the results were highly significant with percent of the pa group having lanza or gastrointestinal damage  whereas percent of the enteric coated aspirin group had this level of gastrointestinal damage 
furthermore  no ulcers were seen in the pa group  while percent of subjects in the enteric coated aspirin mg group developed a gastric ulcer during the study 
this difference was also statistically significant 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any pa product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any pa products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 

table of contents we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our pa program of million during the year ended december   and we have incurred million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
lornoxicam program 
we have conducted development work and clinical studies to investigate the development of novel product candidates containing lornoxicam  alone or in combination with other active ingredients  as potential treatments for pain or other indications 
our exploratory and development work is being conducted under an exclusive license agreement with nycomed  pursuant to which nycomed licensed to us certain rights to develop and commercialize products containing lornoxicam in the us as a part of our agreement with nycomed  we have also granted certain exclusive rights to nycomed to supply us  or our commercialization partners  if any  with lornoxicam active drug substance for use in the manufacture of any of our lornoxicam product candidates 
oral tablet formulation we filed an ind with the fda in for an oral lornoxicam tablet formulation and completed our first human study with this formulation in in patients undergoing dental surgery 
the data from this study confirmed the acute safety profile for lornoxicam in these patients and provided preliminary evidence of efficacy in this pain model 
as a result of the fda advisory committee meeting held in addressing the safety and cardiovascular risks of nsaids  described above  the fda has indicated that long term cardiovascular safety studies will be required prior to nda approval of new nsaid products that may be used on an intermittent or chronic basis  such as our oral tablet lornoxicam product candidate 
injectable formulation we filed an ind with the fda for an injectable lornoxicam formulation in may  and during we initiated the first human studies with this formulation under our ind 
we have completed a phase pharmacokinetic study as well as two phase studies to evaluate lornoxicam for management of acute post operative bunionectomy pain and for management of migraine pain 
in the phase bunionectomy study  both active doses of lornoxicam were significantly better than placebo in the acute management of pain following bunionectomy 
based on the results of our phase migraine study  we currently do not intend to pursue the migraine indications 
we continue to evaluate the strategic direction of our lornoxicam product candidates and the lornoxicam program based on the results of our clinical studies  the regulatory environment and commercial opportunities 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the amount or timing of the costs necessary to continue exploratory development and or complete the development of any lornoxicam product candidates we may seek to develop or when  if and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from any lornoxicam products 
the additional costs that may be incurred include expenses relating to clinical trials and other research and development activities and activities necessary to obtain regulatory approvals 
we incurred direct development costs associated with the development of our lornoxicam program of million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december   and we incurred million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation or our overhead expenses 
mt in may  we received a not approvable letter from the fda with respect to our nda for mt  our proprietary combination of metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium 
in september  after an fda advisory committee concluded that the potential but unquantified risk of the occurrence of an involuntary neurological movement disorder known as tardive dyskinesia associated with the use of metoclopramide would outweigh the benefits of the mt combination  we decided to discontinue further development of mt in the us and to reevaluate our mt european strategy 
as a part of that reevaluation  in september we terminated our license agreement with nycomed for the development and commercialization of mt in denmark  norway  sweden and finland in exchange for a payment to nycomed of  we are exploring the possibility of selling or otherwise disposing of the mt asset to a third party  although there can be no assurance that we will  or will be able to  consummate such a transaction 
in october  we submitted a market authorization application maa for mt for the acute treatment of migraine to the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra in the united kingdom uk 
in november  we received notification that the mhra had granted us marketing approval for mt in the uk 
we are not currently conducting and do not plan to conduct any clinical trials for mt and do not expect to incur any additional significant development costs related to mt we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 

table of contents mt in october  we received a not approvable letter from the fda related to our nda for mt  which we had submitted in december based upon our understanding from our most recent discussions with the fda  in which the fda affirmed its previously stated concerns that approval of the nda was problematic due to the higher incidence of nausea at two hours following dosing in patients treated with mt compared with placebo  and our understanding of the current fda standards for approving migraine drugs  we do not believe it is possible to reverse the not approvable status of the nda for mt we began discussions with our partner  valeant na  regarding termination of our mt commercialization agreement 
in july  we received a letter from valeant na seeking payment of a million withdrawal fee required under certain conditions under the agreement 
under the agreement  if we determine that additional studies or data that are required by the fda for approval of the nda for mt would jeopardize the commercial viability of mt or exceed our financial resources available for mt  we may elect to withdraw the nda 
if we notify valeant na of this situation and valeant na elects not to assume control of efforts to seek approval of the nda  then  under the conditions outlined in the agreement  upon notice from valeant na  the agreement will terminate and we would be required to pay valeant na a termination fee of million 
if valeant na decides to assume development  it would be credited million in development expense 
we do not believe that the withdrawal fee is payable under the circumstances of receipt of the not approvable letter from the fda 
the agreement requires that unresolved disputes by the parties be referred to the respective chief executive officers for resolution 
if still unresolved  the agreement provides for binding arbitration 
valeant na has disputed our conclusion that the withdrawal fee is not payable and has indicated its intention to pursue the dispute resolution provisions provided for under the agreement 
we can give no assurance that valeant na will agree to termination terms acceptable to us  or that we will not be required to pay valeant na the withdrawal fee described above 
we are not currently conducting any clinical trials for mt and do not expect to incur any additional significant development costs related to mt given our current assessment that we do not believe we can reverse the not approvable status of the nda for mt  we believe that we will not receive any future cash inflows from mt we have incurred direct development costs associated with the development of mt of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million from inception to date 
our direct development costs do not include the cost of research and development personnel or any allocation of our overhead expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates management makes certain judgments and uses certain estimates and assumptions when applying accounting principles generally accepted in the us in the preparation of our financial statements 
the development and selection of the critical accounting policies  and the related disclosure about these policies  have been reviewed by the audit committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we have historically discussed and continue to discuss three critical accounting estimates revenue recognition  accrued expenses and income taxes 
revenue recognition our licensing and other collaborative agreements have terms that include up front payments upon contract signing  additional payments if and when certain milestones in the product s development are reached  royalty payments based on future product sales and withdrawal fees if certain conditions are met 
we recognize revenue under these agreements in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition as amended by sab revenue recognition sab  and emerging issues task force eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under sab recognition of revenue from non refundable up front payments is deferred by us upon receipt and recognized over the period ending on the anticipated dates of regulatory approvals  as specified in the agreements relating to the product candidates 
if regulatory approvals or other events relating to our product candidates are accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for these products would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of specified milestones if i the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement and 
table of contents ii the fees are non refundable 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria will be recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when both criteria are met 
additionally  our licensing agreements may include payment for services provided by us on an hourly rate and direct expense basis 
we record such revenue in accordance with the agreements which would generally be based upon time spent and materials used on the project 
in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  under the astrazeneca agreement  we will recognize as revenue the direct costs and certain personnel related expense incurred in performing additional development activities described within the astrazeneca agreement 
we have not previously received royalty revenue but we anticipate such revenue will be recognized related to the manufacture  sale or use of our products or technology 
for those arrangements where royalties are reasonably estimable  we will recognize revenue based on estimates of royalties earned during the applicable period and adjust for differences between the estimated and actual royalties in the following period 
management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate the periods for revenue recognition described above are appropriate  and historical changes in our estimates of these periods have not resulted in material changes in the revenue we recognized 
however  we continually review these estimates  which could result in a change in the deferral period and might impact the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
further  if regulatory approval for trexima is accelerated  delayed or not ultimately obtained  then the amortization of revenues for this product would prospectively be accelerated or reduced accordingly 
as of december   we had deferred revenue on our balance sheet totaling million  of which million is refundable under certain termination or cancellation provisions within our licensing agreements 
the current portion of deferred revenue  totaling million  is expected to be earned in the next twelve months 
we recognized revenue related to our collaborations of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million for the fiscal year ended december  accrued expenses  including contracted costs significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with accrued expenses  including those related to contract costs  such as costs associated with our clinical trials 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
management analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and toxicology and related activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
material differences in the amount and timing of the accrued liability for any period may result if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
our management believes that its current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate accrued expenses for the period are appropriate 
however  determining the date on which certain contract services commence  the extent of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services involves subjective judgments and often must be based upon information provided by third parties 
in the event that we do not identify certain contract costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the extent of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported accrued expenses for such period would be too low or too high  as the case may be 
we recognized accrued costs related to product development and operating activities  including clinical trials  based upon the progress of these activities covered by the related contracts  invoices received and estimated costs  of million at december   million at december  and million at december  the variance  at each of these ending periods  between the actual expenses incurred and the estimated expenses accrued has been less than stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires us to account for share based payment transactions using a fair value based method and recognize the related expense in our results of operations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  as permitted by sfas no 
 we accounted for share based payments to employees using the accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  intrinsic value method 
therefore  prior to january  we generally recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards and did not recognize compensation cost for employee stock options  as all such options had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant 
sfas no 
r allows companies to choose one of two transition methods the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we chose to use the modified prospective transition methodology 
under this transition method  our compensation cost recognized includes compensation costs for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
accordingly  we have not restated our financial results for prior periods 

table of contents under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined by reference to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
consistent with the valuation method we used for disclosure only purposes under the provisions of sfas no 
 we use the black scholes model to value service condition and performance condition option awards under sfas no 
r 
for awards with only service conditions and graded vesting features  we recognize compensation cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance or market conditions granted subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we intend to recognize compensation cost over the expected period to achieve the performance or market condition 
determining the appropriate fair value model and related assumptions requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected terms 
our expected volatility rate was estimated based on an equal weighting of the historical volatility of our common stock over a six year period 
the expected term we use was estimated based on a simplified method as allowed under sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  averaging the vesting term and original contractual term 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on seven year us treasury securities 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate used for the year ended december  was based on actual historical rates 
determining the appropriate amount to expense for performance based awards based on the achievement of stated goals requires judgment  including forecasting future performance results 
the estimate of expense is revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the required performance targets and adjustments are made as appropriate 
the cumulative impact of any revisions is reflected in the period of change 
if any applicable financial performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish an annual valuation allowance 
we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the fiscal years ended december    or and have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or more periods

our effective tax rate was for the twelve month period ended december  the estimated effective rate was based upon income for the fiscal year and estimates of our ability to use remaining net operating loss carry forwards and other tax credits 
however  the actual effective rate may vary depending upon actual licensing fees and milestone payments received  specifically the pre tax book income for the year  and other factors 
income taxes have been accounted for using the liability method in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes

the tax reform act of the tax reform act limits the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the tax reform act  as a result of  among other reasons  past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes  we may not be able to take full advantage of these carry forwards for federal income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering  resulting in cash inflows of million 
since  we have received million from upfront and milestone payments from our collaborators 
additionally  since august  we have received million for development activities pursuant to the terms of our agreement with astrazeneca 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  along with short term investments  totaled million  an increase of million compared to december  the increase in cash was primarily due to our receipt of a million upfront license fee payment in september pursuant to our collaboration agreement with astrazeneca 
our cash is invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks and short term corporate fixed income obligations and us government agency obligations 
during the fiscal year ended december   we moved an additional million into a managed investment account designed to increase the return on our cash 
this account  which is invested as described above  is managed within our board approved investment policy  which restricts investments to maturities of less than twelve months  limits concentration to or less and requires minimum credit ratings of a p  among other requirements 
because certain holdings in the managed account have maturities longer than three months  we have classified these holdings as short term investments in our balance sheet and accounting principles require reporting such investments at market value 
any difference in market value and cost is reported in the stockholder s equity section of our financial statements as comprehensive income or loss

cash required for our operating activities during is projected to increase from our requirements 
during the year ended december  we recorded non cash stock based compensation expense of million primarily as a result of adopting sfas no 
r on january  we also reclassified  from current liabilities to additional paid in capital  million of prior year accrued compensation related to the expensing of restricted stock units and performance based options granted under the trexima incentive program 
this reclassification also resulted from our adoption of sfas no 
r 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
our operating expenses for and are expected to increase from the level of our operating expenses in however  we believe that we will have sufficient cash reserves to maintain that level of business activities through provided that certain development expenses are paid by astrazeneca  as outlined in the agreement 
as part of our ongoing assessment of our business and liquidity needs  we regularly assess available funding options and will consider available funding opportunities as they arise 
we may sell shares of common stock in the future to fund additional development activities and increase our working capital 
we have filed with the securities and exchange commission sec  and the sec has declared effective  a shelf registration statement on form s under which we may register up to  shares of our common stock for sale in one or more public offerings 
certain selling stockholders named in the prospectus for the registration statement may offer up to an aggregate of  of such shares  and we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sales of shares made by the selling stockholders 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which we expect that our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our success  or any delays  in obtaining  and any delays in obtaining  regulatory approval of our product candidates and success in  and manner of  commercializing our products  the success of our existing collaborations and our ability to establish additional collaborations  the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  technologies or products  costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights  our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in our trials and studies  and costs incurred in the defense of the class action lawsuit that is pending against us and our president and chief executive officer relating to mt and mt obligations and commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the expected timing of maturities of those contractual obligations

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends fasb statement no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas no 
however  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
we adopted sfas no 
r on january  sfas no 
r requires us to account for share based payment transactions using a fair value based method and recognize the related expense in our results of operations 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  as permitted by sfas no 
 we accounted for share based payments to employees using the apb intrinsic value method and  therefore we generally recognized compensation expense for restricted stock awards and did not recognize compensation cost for employee stock options as such options had an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
sfas no 
r allows companies to choose one of two transition methods the modified prospective transition method or the modified retrospective transition method 
we chose to use the modified prospective transition methodology 
we have not restated our financial results from prior periods as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we continue to assess the impact that fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  will have on our consolidated financial statements 
issued by the fasb in june  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosure 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the proceeds from our initial public offering  private placements and revenue from our collaboration agreements have been invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks and short term corporate fixed income obligations and us government and government agency obligations 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio
