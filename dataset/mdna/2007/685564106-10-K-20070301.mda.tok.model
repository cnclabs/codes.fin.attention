item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview with the exception of historical information  the matters discussed within this item and elsewhere in this form k include forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
readers should be cautioned that a number of important factors  including those identified above in item special note regarding forward looking statements and item a risk factors may affect actual results and may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or expected in any forward looking statement 
historical results of operations may not be indicative of future operating results 
we develop and manufacture small rockets and space systems for commercial  military and civil government customers 
our primary products are satellites and launch vehicles  including low earth orbit  geosynchronous earth orbit and planetary spacecraft for communications  remote sensing  scientific and defense missions  ground and air launched rockets that deliver satellites into orbit  and missile defense systems that are used as interceptor and target vehicles 
we also offer space related technical services to government agencies and develop and build software based transportation management systems for public transit agencies and private vehicle fleet operators 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain 
such judgments affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management continuously evaluates its estimates and assumptions  including those related to long term contracts and incentives  inventories  long lived assets  warranty obligations  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and such differences may be material 
the following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our revenue is derived primarily from long term contracts 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized to the extent of costs incurred plus a proportionate amount of fee earned 
revenues on long term fixed price contracts are generally recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage that costs incurred to date bear to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment  including management s assumptions regarding our future operations as well as general economic conditions 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
frequently  the period of performance of a contract extends over a long period of time and  as such  revenue recognition and our profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected to the extent that estimated cost to complete or incentive or award fee estimates are revised  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded 
accordingly  our recorded revenues and gross profits from period to period can fluctuate significantly 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss  excluding general and administrative expense  is recorded in the period in which the loss is first estimated 
certain contracts include provisions for increased or decreased revenue and profit based on performance against established targets 
incentive and award fees are included in estimated contract revenue at the time the amounts can be reasonably determined and are reasonably assured based upon historical experience and other objective criteria 
if performance under such contracts were to differ from previous assumptions  current period revenues and profits would be adjusted and could therefore fluctuate significantly 
as of december   unbilled receivables included million of incentive fees on certain satellite contracts that become due incrementally over periods of up to years  subject to the achievement of performance criteria 
additionally  some satellite contracts require us to refund cash to the customer if performance criteria  which cover periods of up to years  are not satisfied and  as of december   up to million of revenues recognized under such contracts could be reversed if satellite performance criteria were not met 
we generally procure insurance policies that would indemnify us for satellite incentive fees that are not earned and for performance refund obligations 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
cost is determined on an average cost or specific identification basis 
estimated market value is determined based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions were less favorable than those previously projected by management  inventory write downs could be required 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a tax rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we record valuation allowances to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount considered more likely than not to be realized 
changes in estimates of future taxable income can materially change the amount of such valuation allowances 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
under this method  no compensation expense was recognized as long as the exercise price equaled or exceeded the market price of the underlying stock on the measurement date of the grant 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
as of january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest  and the short cut method to determine the pool of windfall tax benefits 
we use the tax law ordering method as our policy for intra period tax allocation related to the tax attributes of stock based compensation 
during  we recorded million of compensation expense under sfas no 
r attributable to stock options 
the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of our restricted stock unit grants is determined based on the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with our valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires significant judgment 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results  and future changes in estimates  may differ substantially from current estimates 
consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million in  a increase compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by million revenue growth in our satellites and space systems segment and million growth in our transportation management systems segment  offset partially by a million decrease in our launch vehicles segment 
the satellites and space systems segment growth was driven by significantly higher revenues in the communications satellites product line related to progress on several satellite contracts awarded in the transportation management systems segment growth was largely driven by work on several new contracts started in and early launch vehicles segment revenues decreased due to lower revenues from the interceptor launch vehicles and the target launch vehicles product lines  partially offset by higher revenues from the space launch vehicles product line 
see segment results below for further details about how revenues compared to results 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in  a increase compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in as compared to was due to a million  or  increase in our satellites and space systems segment  a million  or  increase in our transportation management systems segment and a million  or  increase in our launch vehicles segment 
the increase in gross profit in our satellites and space systems segment was principally due to higher revenues  driven by an increased level of contract activity in  and significantly improved contract profitability in the communications satellites product line resulting from net cost reductions and favorable contract adjustments 
the increase in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to the increase in revenues 
although launch vehicles revenues decreased  the segment s gross profit increased marginally due to the segment s overall operating margin improvement and cost growth on certain contracts in that did not recur in research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
our research and development expenses relate primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in compared to million  or of revenues  in the increase in research and development expenses primarily related to communications satellites and launch vehicle control systems 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased stock based compensation expenses that were recorded in  as discussed below  along with increased bid  proposal and marketing expenses and higher professional fees 
bid  proposal and marketing expenses increased million primarily due to our pursuit of new programs in the satellites and space systems segment 
the increase in professional expenses was primarily due to million of fees incurred in connection with a review of stock based compensation grants and procedures that was completed in in  our stock based compensation expense increased to million  compared to million in  due to restricted stock units granted in and the majority of these costs are reported in selling  general and administrative expenses and the remainder are reported in cost of goods sold 
as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock awards  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense in remained relatively consistent with interest expense in primarily as a result of our unchanged fixed rate debt balance during the majority of interest income and other interest income and other was million and million in and  respectively  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income increased primarily as a result of higher interest rates and higher short term invested cash balances 
other income in included a million gain from the liquidation of an investment written off in debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million of debt extinguishment expenses associated with the repurchase of substantially all of our senior notes as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
the debt extinguishment expenses consisted of million in accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and million in prepayment premiums and other expenses 
income taxes we recorded million and million of income tax expense in and  respectively  reflecting an annualized effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
the increase in our effective income tax rate was primarily related to higher state income tax expense 
our cash income tax payments  which primarily relate to alternative minimum tax amt  are currently approximately of pretax income primarily due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards that substantially offset taxable income 
net income our consolidated net income was million and million  or and diluted net income per share  in and  respectively 
the increase in net income in was due to a million increase in pretax income  partially offset by a million increase in our income tax provision 
compared with revenues our consolidated revenues were million in  a increase compared to million in this increase was driven primarily by million revenue growth in our launch vehicles segment and million growth in our satellites and space systems segment  offset partially by a million decrease in our transportation management systems segment 
the launch vehicles segment growth was driven by higher revenues in the interceptor launch vehicles and target launch vehicles product lines  partially offset by lower revenues in the space launch vehicles product line 
the satellites and space systems segment growth was driven by significantly higher revenues in the communications satellites product line  offset partially by lower revenues from science  technology and defense satellite contracts and space technical services 
transportation management systems segment revenues decreased due to the completion or near completion of certain contracts 
gross profit our consolidated gross profit was million in  a increase compared to million in gross profit is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of contract types and costs incurred thereon in relation to revenues recognized 
such costs include the costs of personnel  materials  subcontracts and overhead 
the gross profit increase in  as compared to  was due to a million  or  increase in our launch vehicles segment  a million  or  increase in our satellites and space systems segment and a million  or  increase in our transportation management systems segment 
the increase in gross profit in our launch vehicles segment was primarily attributable to a higher profit from the interceptor launch vehicles product line due to increased activity levels in and cost growth on taurus and pegasus rocket contracts recorded in that did not recur in these increases were partially offset by cost growth on certain contracts in the increase in gross profit in our satellites and space systems segment was largely due to million of revenue and profit recorded in the second quarter of related to satellite acceptance and incentive fees received from a customer and former affiliate 
although revenues were higher in our satellites and space systems segment  profit was lower in due to significant cost growth on our communication satellites contracts 
the increase in our transportation management systems segment was largely attributable to improved profitability on certain transportation management systems contracts 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are comprised of our self funded product research and development activities and exclude direct customer funded development activities 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in both and these expenses related primarily to the development of improved launch vehicles and satellites 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  and million  or of revenues  in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the costs of our finance  legal  administrative and general management functions  as well as bid  proposal and marketing costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was driven by increases in bid  proposal and marketing costs  higher legal fees and expenses and increased personnel related costs 
the increase in bid  proposal and marketing costs was driven by satellite and launch vehicle proposal efforts in legal fees and expenses related to the us government investigation initiated in and described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements totaled approximately million in personnel related costs increased largely due to higher staff levels and  in part  due to the amortization of stock based compensation granted in settlement expense in  we recorded a million gain as a credit to settlement expense in connection with the sale of senior subordinated notes which we had received in from a former affiliate 
interest expense interest expense was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense in remained relatively consistent with interest expense in primarily as a result of our unchanged fixed rate debt balance during interest income and other interest income and other was million and million in and  respectively  consisting primarily of interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income increased primarily as a result of higher interest rates and higher short term invested cash balances 
debt extinguishment expense during  we recorded million of debt extinguishment expenses associated with repurchases of a portion of our senior notes and the replacement of our bank credit agreement as further described in liquidity and capital resources 
income taxes in the fourth quarter of  we reversed substantially all of our deferred tax valuation allowance due to our assessment that substantially all of our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable 
this resulted in our recording significantly higher income tax expense beginning in  nearly all of which is offset by net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets  resulting in minimal cash tax payments which primarily relate to amt 
we recorded million of income tax expense in  reflecting an annualized effective income tax rate of 
the million net income tax benefit recorded in was comprised of i million in deferred tax benefit in connection with the reversal of the valuation allowance discussed above and ii a million current provision for amt and state tax obligations 
net income our consolidated net income was million and million  or and diluted earnings per share  in and  respectively 
the decrease in net income in was due to a million increase in pretax income  offset by the impact of the million net income tax benefit in compared to the million income tax expense in segment results our products and services are grouped into three reportable segments i launch vehicles  ii satellites and space systems  and iii transportation management systems 
corporate office transactions that have not been attributed to a particular segment  as well as consolidating eliminations and adjustments  are reported in corporate and other 
the following table summarizes revenues and income from operations for our reportable business segments and corporate and other in thousands years ended december  revenues launch vehicles satellites and space systems transportation management systems corporate and other total income loss from operations launch vehicles satellites and space systems transportation management systems corporate and other total compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues decreased primarily due to a million revenue decrease in our interceptor launch vehicles product line and a million revenue decrease in our target launch vehicles product line  partially offset by a million revenue increase in our space launch vehicles product line 
in our interceptor launch vehicles product line  we are developing and manufacturing interceptor boosters designed to defend against ballistic missile attacks  including the midcourse phase orbital boost vehicle obv for the ground based missile defense program and the boost phase kinetic energy interceptor kei program directed by the us missile defense agency 
revenues from the interceptor launch vehicles product line decreased primarily due to a customer directed reduction in activity on our obv program  offset partially by increased activity on our kei program due to ramp up of the development efforts on a demonstration vehicle test scheduled for late interceptor launch vehicles accounted for and of total launch vehicles segment revenues in and  respectively 
target launch vehicle revenues decreased in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in activity on certain target launch vehicle programs in  partially offset by higher revenue on the supersonic sea skimming target program for the us navy due to transition from development into low rate initial production 
space launch vehicle revenues increased primarily due to higher levels of activity on taurus and minotaur programs offset by a reduction in pegasus program activity 
the taurus program ramped up in in anticipation of future launches  and in the second quarter of  we received and began work on an order for two minotaur vehicles 
pegasus program activity declined primarily due to customer directed delays in launch schedules 
operating income in the launch vehicles segment decreased for operating income from interceptor launch vehicles continued to be the largest contributor to this segment s operating income  with million and million of operating profit in and  respectively  or and  respectively  of total operating income in this segment 
the decrease in interceptor launch vehicle operating income was due to the previously mentioned reduction in revenues and program activity in this product line and to slightly lower contract fee accrual estimates in operating income from space launch vehicles increased consistent with the product line s revenue increase and improved cost performance on contracts 
operating income from our target launch vehicle product line increased marginally despite lower product line revenues  primarily due to cost growth that impacted several contracts in the launch vehicles segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues improved to in  compared to in this margin increase was due to improved space launch vehicle and target launch vehicle margins due to improved program performance resulting from higher incentive fees  cost control initiatives and continued implementation of lean manufacturing techniques 
satellites and space systems satellites and space systems segment revenues increased primarily as a result of a million increase in communications satellites product line revenues related to substantial progress on several new satellite contracts awarded in there were six commercial communications satellites in various stages of completion throughout as compared to four in various stages of completion throughout communications satellites revenues accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our science  technology and defense satellite product line largely due to a reduction in contract activity on a satellite that was launched in the second quarter of operating income in the satellites and space systems segment increased primarily due to the significant growth in revenues and contract activity in our communications satellites product line in addition to net cost reductions and favorable contract adjustments in in addition  operating income in our science  technology and defense satellites product line increased despite the reduction in revenues largely due to a favorable contract adjustment after the successful launch of a satellite in the second quarter of this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues improved to in  compared to in this margin increase was primarily due to cost reductions and related operating performance improvements in the communications satellites product line 
transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues increased in compared to largely driven by work on several new contracts started in and early three projects in california  maryland and washington accounted for approximately million of revenue growth 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction in revenues recognized on a project in singapore due to a reduction in activity as the contract was substantially completed at the end of operating income increased in compared to primarily due to the new contracts discussed above 
this segment s operating margin as a percentage of revenues improved to in  compared to in due to improved operating performance on contracts started in and early corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other loss from operations is comprised solely of transactions that have not been attributed to a particular segment 
compared with launch vehicles launch vehicles segment revenues increased primarily due to a million revenue increase from our interceptor launch vehicles product line and a million revenue increase from our target launch vehicles product line  partially offset by a million revenue decrease in our space launch vehicles product line 
the interceptor launch vehicles product line accounted for million and million in revenues  or and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues in our target launch vehicles product line increased primarily due to a higher level of activity on target vehicles in revenues decreased in our space launch vehicles product line primarily due to lower levels of activity on taurus and minotaur programs and on the dart mission launched in april also contributing to the decrease in our space launch vehicles product line was a non recurring million early termination fee in in connection with a taurus contract cancellation  partially offset by increased activity in on pegasus programs 
we completed one pegasus launch during compared to no pegasus launches in  and we completed no taurus launches in compared to one taurus launch in operating income in the launch vehicles segment increased primarily due to improved operating results in the interceptor launch vehicles and the space launch vehicles product lines 
operating income from our interceptor launch vehicles product line was the largest contributor to this segment s operating income  reporting million  or  of total segment operating profit in  compared to million  or  in the profit growth in interceptors was driven by higher activity levels in while space launch vehicles revenues were lower  operating profit improved in this product line due to increased activity on pegasus programs and significant cost growth in on a pegasus contract and a taurus contract that did not recur in  offset partially by the million contract termination fee in discussed above 
although target launch vehicles revenues were higher  operating results declined marginally in this product line primarily due to cost growth impacting several contracts 
segment operating margin as a percentage of revenues was in  compared to in the increase in operating margin was primarily the result of improved interceptor launch vehicles margins and the impact of the contract cost growth discussed above  offset partially by million of investigation related legal expenses discussed previously that are reflected in the launch vehicles segment financial results in satellites and space systems satellites and space systems segment revenues increased as a result of a million increase in revenues in our communications satellites product line  partially offset by a million decrease in our science  technology and defense satellite product line and a million decrease in space technical services revenues 
revenues increased in our communications satellites product line due to revenues on several recently awarded geosynchronous orbit satellite contracts begun in communications satellites revenues accounted for and of total segment revenues in and  respectively 
revenues decreased in our science  technology and defense satellites product line as a result of a decline in activity on certain contracts that were in the latter stages of production in  offset partially by million of revenue recorded in the second quarter of related to satellite acceptance and incentive fees received from a customer and former affiliate 
revenues from space technical services declined largely due to lower levels of program activity 
operating income in the satellites and space systems segment decreased million due to a million decrease in operating results in the communications satellites product line  partially offset by higher income in our other product lines 
the decline in communications satellites operating results was primarily due to significant cost growth on certain contracts in  partially offset by operating income from the contracts begun in mentioned previously  resulting in an operating loss in the communications satellites product line in the increase in our other product lines was primarily due to million of operating profit from the satellite acceptance and incentive fees discussed above offset partially by lower income on certain science  technology and defense contracts driven by lower activity levels 
segment operating margin was in  compared to in the decrease in operating margin was largely due to the communications satellite cost growth noted above 
transportation management systems transportation management systems segment revenues decreased in compared to largely due to completion or near completion of certain contracts  partially offset by revenues from several recently awarded contracts 
although revenues decreased  operating income increased million largely due to higher profit rates in from recently awarded contracts 
this improved profitability was partially offset by a million charge to reserve a note receivable in and by the absence in of a favorable revenue adjustment in on a contract that was renegotiated and resumed in corporate and other corporate and other revenues are comprised solely of the elimination of intercompany revenues 
corporate and other operating income in was comprised primarily of the first quarter gain on the sale of notes received from a former affiliate discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operating activities cash flow from operating activities in was million as compared to million in and million in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to cash flows resulting from changes in assets and liabilities 
cash from operations in included a million favorable net change in assets and liabilities  primarily due to a million increase in deferred revenues  partially offset by a million increase in receivables 
the increase in deferred revenues was primarily due to cash received in advance of contract performance on certain communications satellite programs 
the increase in receivables was consistent with revenue growth in the increase in as compared to was primarily due to a million increase in changes in assets and liabilities 
cash flow from investing activities in  we spent million for capital expenditures  as compared to million in the increase in capital expenditures is primarily related to additional integration and test equipment and ongoing expansion of facilities to support the growth requirements of our satellites and space systems segment 
cash flow from financing activities in december we issued million of convertible notes payable as discussed in more detail below 
we used the net proceeds from the issuance of these notes  together with available cash  to repurchase million of our senior notes due for million and to repurchase and retire million outstanding shares of our common stock for million 
debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the convertible notes were million  which will be amortized to interest expense over seven years 
in  we repurchased and retired a total of million shares of our common stock at a cost of million  including the million shares repurchased in connection with the refinancing transaction discussed in the paragraph above 
in  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock at a cost of million  and in  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
during  and  we received million  million and million  respectively  from the issuance of common stock in connection with stock option and warrant exercises and employee stock plan purchases 
during  we repurchased and cancelled million of our senior notes at a cost of million  and we expended million to obtain a new credit facility 
convertible notes on december   we issued million of convertible senior subordinated notes due with interest payable semi annually each january and july the convertible notes are convertible into cash  or a combination of cash and common stock at our election  based on an initial conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  in principal amount of the convertible notes equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share only under any of the following circumstances if  prior to january   on any date beginning after march   the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days whether or not consecutive in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than of the conversion price per common share in effect on the applicable trading day  if  prior to january   during the consecutive trading day period following any consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of the convertible notes was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock multiplied by the applicable conversion rate  if the convertible notes have been called for redemption  at any time prior to the close of business on the third business day prior to the redemption date  if we elect to distribute to all holders of our common stock certain rights entitling them to purchase  for a period expiring within days  our common stock at less than the average of the closing sale prices of our common stock for the consecutive trading days immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution  if we elect to distribute  to all holders of our common stock  assets  debt securities or certain rights to purchase our securities  which distribution has a per share value exceeding of the closing sale price of our common stock on the trading day immediately preceding the declaration date of such distribution  or during a specified period  if a fundamental change as such term is defined in the indenture governing the convertible notes occurs 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustments in certain circumstances set forth in the indenture governing the convertible notes 
upon conversion of the convertible notes  we will deliver  in respect of each  principal amount of notes tendered for conversion  an amount in cash principal return equal to the lesser of a the principal amount of the converted notes and b the conversion value such value equal to the conversion rate multiplied by the average price of our common shares over a consecutive day trading period and if the conversion value is greater than the principal return  an amount in cash or common shares  or combination thereof at our option  with a value equal to the difference between the conversion value and the principal return

we are required to file a shelf registration statement providing for the resale by the holders of the convertible notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible notes within days after issuance of the convertible notes  and to use our reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared effective within days after issuance of the convertible notes 
in the event that we fail to file on a timely basis an effective registration statement  we would be required to pay additional interest equal to per annum of the aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes for the day period beginning on the date of the registration default and thereafter at a rate per year equal to 
senior credit facility we have a million senior credit facility the credit facility with the option to increase the amount of the credit facility up to million to the extent that any one or more lenders commit to be a lender for such amount 
loans under the credit facility bear interest at libor plus a margin ranging from to or at a prime rate plus a margin ranging from zero to  with the applicable margin in each case varying according to our ratio of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the credit facility is collateralized by our intellectual property and accounts receivable 
up to million of the credit facility may be reserved for letters of credit 
as of december   there were no borrowings under the credit facility  although million of letters of credit were issued under the credit facility 
accordingly  as of december   million of the credit facility was available for borrowing 
our credit facility contains covenants limiting our ability to  among other things  incur additional debt  pay cash dividends  make investments  redeem or repurchase orbital stock  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with others and dispose of assets or create liens on assets 
in addition  the credit facility contains financial covenants with respect to leverage  secured leverage  fixed charge coverage  consolidated net worth and the ratio of accounts receivable to senior secured indebtedness

available cash and future funding at december   we had million of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
management believes that available cash  cash expected to be generated from operations and borrowing capacity under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
our ability to borrow additional funds is limited by the terms of our credit facility 
additionally  significant unforeseen events such as termination of major orders or late delivery or failure of launch vehicle or satellite products could adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations 
in april and  our board of directors authorized the purchase of up to million of our outstanding debt and equity securities over a month period
