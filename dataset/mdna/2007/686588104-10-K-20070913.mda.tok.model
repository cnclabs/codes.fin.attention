during the second half of fiscal and all of fiscal  the company faced several challenges relating to unfavorable market conditions in the housing industry  including a increased new and resale home inventory levels  b decreased homebuyer demand due to lower consumer confidence in the overall housing market  c increased uncertainty in the overall mortgage market  and d increased underwriting standards 
the decrease in homebuyer demand as a result of lower consumer confidence can be attributed to concerns of prospective buyers of new homes about the direction of home prices  which has increased general homebuyer uncertainty regarding whether now is the right time to buy a home 
the uncertainty in the mortgage market is partially the result of concerns regarding the sub prime mortgage market  which has experienced rising delinquencies and defaults by borrowers as they experience financial difficulties due to rising interest rates 
this credit deterioration has led to the bankruptcies of major sub prime mortgage lenders  reduced general availability of mortgage financing and the tightening of lending standards 
while the company has minimal exposure to the sub prime markets  these factors may make it more difficult for our potential customers to sell their existing homes 
these market challenges are evidenced by the overall reduction in new orders for the year ended june  as compared to the year ended june  new orders decreased  or  which represents homes 
as a result of these challenges  the company recorded inventory impairments  goodwill impairments and write offs of abandoned projects and other pre acquisition costs  as detailed below 
in addition to these charges  the company reduced headcount in all of its regions and took other steps to control increasing costs

the company believes that its efforts to attract new customers has been successful as new orders during the second half of fiscal have increased by  or  on homes over the same period in the prior year

on august   the company entered into supplemental indenture no 
the supplemental indenture  to the  of trust preferred securities  which amends the terms of the securities  as follows the supplemental indenture defers the potential start of the payment of the adjusted interest rate  which is over the regular interest rate of  for four quarters so that the earliest that the adjusted interest rate could be payable is with the coupon payable on october   rather than on october   the first date that ohi financing  inc ohi financing would have been required to pay the adjusted interest rate 
specifically  the indenture was revised to provide that the first fiscal quarter end at which the applicable interest coverage ratio and minimum consolidated tangible net worth measure must be met for at least three of the last four consecutive fiscal quarters for purposes of determining the applicability of the adjusted interest rate is the fiscal quarter ending june  if the applicable interest coverage ratio or minimum consolidated tangible net worth measure is not met as of the end of a fiscal quarter for at least three of the last four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or after june   the applicable rate of interest increases to the adjusted interest rate 
under the supplemental indenture  ohi financing will generally have to make eight consecutive adjusted interest rate coupon payments other than the eight consecutive adjusted interest rate coupon payments that could be made on each of the coupon payment dates from october  to and including july  to cause an event of default under the supplemental indenture or in some cases six consecutive coupon payments rather than the four consecutive coupon payments in the original indenture 
more specifically  the supplemental indenture provides that the earliest an event of default could occur as a result of the payment of the adjusted interest rate is i upon the payment of the adjusted interest rate coupon for october   if applicable  provided there have been eight prior consecutive adjusted interest rate coupons paid by ohi financing  ii on either the fiscal quarter ended march  or the fiscal year ended june   if at either date both the trailing twelve months interest coverage ratio is less than to  and ohi financing has made the six prior consecutive adjusted interest rate coupon payments  or iii on the fiscal quarter ended september   if at such time both the trailing twelve months interest coverage ratio is less than to  and ohi financing has made the eight prior consecutive adjusted interest rate coupon payments 
the adjusted interest rate must be paid for eight or in some instances six consecutive coupons in order to trigger an event of default 
if the interest coverage ratio test and the minimum consolidated tangible net worth test  are both met  ohi financing would make the payment of the regular interest rate for the next coupon  and the adjusted interest rate test resets requiring ohi financing to make eight or in some instances six new consecutive coupon payments at the adjusted interest rate before triggering an event of default 
the interest coverage ratio and minimum consolidated tangible net worth measure are not traditional financial maintenance covenants  they are only utilized in determining if the adjusted interest rate or the regular interest rate is applicable 
the supplemental indenture amended the definition of both adjusted ebitda and debt service and added the new defined term  consolidated net income  all of which are utilized in the calculation of the interest coverage ratio as defined by the indenture for the determination of whether the adjusted interest rate applies 
the supplemental indenture provides that consolidated net income is to be used when determining adjusted ebitda under the indenture rather than net income determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
consolidated net income generally means the net income of the company and its majority controlled subsidiaries with respect to the relevant accounting period  provided that the after tax impacts of certain items are generally excluded  such as i any impairment charge  asset write off  abandonment charge  deposit forfeiture or write off of other pre acquisition costs pursuant to gaap or other similar amounts  ii any extraordinary  non recurring or unusual gains  losses or expenses including any gain or loss on asset dispositions such as land and other similar asset sales  iii any severance costs  relocation costs and curtailments or modifications to pension and post retirement employee benefit plans  iv any net income or net loss from disposed of or discontinued operations  v the amortization of intangibles  the early extinguishment of debt or hedging obligations  any fees or expenses incurred for the issuance  refinancing or modification of any debt or equity security  vi any non cash compensation charges from stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock or other similar rights  vii typical adjustments for entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting  and viii typical purchase accounting adjustments for any acquisition consummated in the future 
the definition of debt service used in the determination of the trailing twelve months interest coverage ratio was modified to exclude from debt service i any additional interest paid as a result of the adjusted interest rate being in effect  and ii the payment of the fee payable in connection with obtaining the consent necessary for the supplemental indenture 
the optional redemption provisions of the indenture have been modified to generally provide that ohi financing may  at its option  on any date that is on or after january   redeem the trust preferred issue in whole or in part at a redemption price equal to one hundred percent of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
previously  redemption of the issue was permitted only on interest coupon payment dates on or after january  provisions were added to the indenture permitting legal defeasance and covenant defeasance  subject to certain terms and conditions  including the posting of cash or certain government obligations in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the payment obligations of the securities to the stated maturity or the redemption date  as the case may be 
for purposes of these legal defeasance and covenant defeasance provisions  the interest rate at which the securities shall bear interest shall be a fixed rate equal to per annum 
for the supplemental indenture to become effective  ohi financing must on of before september  establish a  reserve fund for the benefit of the holders of the trust preferred securities by posting a letter of credit or cash with the trustee under the supplemental indenture 
if the adjusted interest rate is in effect for the four consecutive coupon payments ending july   this reserve fund must be increased by  under certain events of default  this reserve fund may be drawn by the trustee and used in respect of the trust preferred obligations 
the supplemental indenture also provides for the release of the reserve fund upon the earlier of compliance with the applicable interest coverage ratio resulting in ohi financing paying interest at the regular interest rate rather than the adjusted interest rate  or redemption or defeasance of the notes in accordance with the terms of the supplemental indenture 
this reserve fund has been established in accordance with the terms of the supplemental indenture 
on september   the company issued  of trust preferred securities which mature on september  and are callable  in whole or in part  at par plus accrued interest on or after september  for the first ten years  the securities have a fixed interest rate of per annum 
thereafter  the securities have a floating interest rate equal to three month libor plus basis points per annum  resetting quarterly 
the securities are treated as debt obligations for financial statement purposes 
the company used proceeds from the sale of these securities to fund land purchases and residential construction 
the obligations relating to the trust preferred securities are subordinated to the revolving credit facility 
employee retirement plan on december   the company adopted an unfunded  non qualified target defined benefit retirement plan  effective as of september   which covers a group of management employees of the company 
the company owns life insurance policies on all participants in the supplemental executive retirement plan serp 
this serp  which was amended on march   is intended to provide the participants with an annual supplemental retirement benefit based upon their years of service with the company and highest average compensation for five consecutive years 
the annual supplemental benefit for each participant will be adjusted based on the actual performance of the serp compared to the target 
the benefit is payable for life with a minimum of years guaranteed 
in order to qualify for normal retirement benefits  a participant must attain age with at least five years of participation in the serp 
early retirement will be permitted beginning at age  after years of participation in the serp 
early retirement benefits will be adjusted actuarially to reflect the early retirement date 
if a participant terminates employment with the company prior to attaining his or her normal retirement age  other than by reason of early retirement  death or disability  the participant generally will forfeit all benefits under the serp 
the company can amend or terminate the serp at any time 
however  no amendment or termination will affect the participants accrued benefits as determined in accordance with the serp or delay any payments to a participant beyond the time that such amount would otherwise be payable without regard to the amendment 
deferred compensation plan on december   the company adopted an executive compensation deferral plan the deferral plan effective as of june  under the plan  participants will have the ability to defer a portion of their compensation which will be credited to an account maintained by the company for the participant 
amounts contributed by participants are always vested 
participant deferral accounts will be maintained by the company for recordkeeping purposes only 
participants will have no interest in any assets which may be set aside by the company to meet its obligations under the deferral plan 
share repurchase program in september  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to one million shares of the company s common stock 
the repurchases  which represent up to of the company s million shares of common stock currently outstanding  may be made from time to time through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions at the company s discretion and in accordance with the rules of the securities and exchange commission 
effective june  and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the fourth amendment  the company is no longer permitted to repurchase shares of common stock 
the company did not repurchase any of its common stock during the year ended june  during the year ended june   the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for a total purchase price of  cash flow statement net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  was  compared to net cash used in operating activities for the year ended june  of  the decrease was primarily attributable to decreases in cash used for real estate held for development and sale offset by increases in cash used for accounts payable and other liabilities 
the reduction in charges related to real estate held for development and sale is primarily in response to the overall market conditions 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  this decrease was related to the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended june  was  compared to  for the year ended june  the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities in the current year is primarily attributable to borrowings in fiscal  related to the trust preferred securities that were issued during that year 
the company did not borrow additional funds due to the reduction in cash used in operating activities as noted above 
lot positions as of june   the company owned or controlled  building lots 
included in the aforementioned lots  the company had contracted to purchase  or has under option  undeveloped land and improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  that are expected to yield approximately  building lots 
undeveloped land acquisitions in recent years  the process of acquiring desirable undeveloped land is extremely competitive  particularly in the northern region  mostly due to the lack of available parcels suitable for development 
in addition  expansion of regulation in the housing industry has increased the time it takes to acquire undeveloped land with all of the necessary governmental approvals required to begin construction 
generally  the company structures its land acquisitions so that it has the right to cancel its agreements to purchase undeveloped land by forfeiture of its deposit under the agreement 
as of june   all but one of the company s agreements to purchase undeveloped land was structured in this manner 
for the year ended june   the company forfeited  of land deposits and expensed an additional  of pre acquisition costs related to the write off of purchase agreements 
included in the balance sheet captions inventory not owned variable interest entities and land deposits and costs of future development  at june  the company had  invested in parcels of undeveloped land  of which  is cash deposits  a portion of which is non refundable 
at june   overall undeveloped parcels of land under contract had an aggregate purchase price of approximately  and were expected to yield approximately  building lots 
the company attempts to further mitigate the risks involved in acquiring undeveloped land by structuring its undeveloped land acquisitions so that the deposits required under the agreements coincide with certain benchmarks in the governmental approval process  thereby limiting the amount at risk 
this process allows the company to periodically review the approval process and make a decision on the viability of developing the parcel to be acquired based upon expected profitability 
in some circumstances the company may be required to make deposits solely due to the passage of time 
this structure still provides the company an opportunity to periodically review the viability of developing the parcel of land 
in addition  the company primarily structures its agreements to purchase undeveloped land to be contingent upon obtaining all governmental approvals necessary for construction 
under most agreements  the company secures the responsibility for obtaining the required governmental approvals as the company believes that it has significant expertise in this area 
the company intends to complete the acquisition of undeveloped land only after all governmental approvals are in place 
in certain rare circumstances  however  when all extensions have been exhausted  the company must make a decision on whether to proceed with the purchase even though all governmental approvals have not yet been received 
in these circumstances  the company performs reasonable due diligence to ascertain the likelihood that the necessary governmental approvals will be granted 
improved lot acquisitions the process of acquiring improved building lots from developers is extremely competitive 
the company competes with many national homebuilders to acquire improved building lots  some of which have greater financial resources than the company 
the acquisition of improved lots is usually less risky than the acquisition of undeveloped land as the contingencies and risks involved in the land development process are borne by the developer rather than the company 
in addition  governmental approvals are generally in place when the improved building lots are acquired 
at june   the company had contracted to purchase or had under option approximately improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  at june   the company had  invested in these improved building lots  of which  is deposits 
there were in deposits forfeited during the year ended june  with respect to improved building lots 
the company expects to utilize primarily the revolving credit facility as described above as well as other existing capital resources  to finance the acquisitions of undeveloped land and improved lots described above 
the company anticipates completing a majority of these acquisitions during the next several years 
inflation inflation can have a significant impact on the company s business performance and the homebuilding industry in general 
rising costs of land  materials  labor  overhead  administrative costs and interest rates on floating credit facilities can adversely affect the company s business performance 
in addition  rising costs of certain items  such as lumber  can adversely affect the expected profitability of the company s backlog 
generally  the company has been able to recover any increases in costs through increased selling prices 
however  there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to increase selling prices to cover the effects of inflation in the future 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments certain off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and commitments are disclosed in various sections of the consolidated financial statements  notes to consolidated financial statements and below 
some typical off balance sheet arrangements affecting the company and commonly affecting homebuilders in general  include cost sharing arrangements and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements  debt and debt service guarantees  surety bonds and standby letters of credit  executed contracts for construction and development activity  and variable interest entities  which are not consolidated 
each of these items is described below or in critical accounting policies following this section 
cost sharing arrangements and unconsolidated real estate joint ventures capital contribution requirements 
the company has developed and owned communities through joint ventures  accounted for using the equity method  with other parties in the past 
however  at the present time joint venture activities do not constitute a material portion of the company s operations 
in addition  the company has partnered with other homebuilders and developers  under cost sharing agreements  to acquire land and or to develop or improve common off site facilities  such as sewer treatment plants  that will benefit both parties 
most of these agreements are established as cost sharing agreements whereby the homebuilders and developers share in the cost of acquiring the parcel or improving the off site facility 
the company currently does not have any material unfunded commitments or capital contribution requirements with respect to joint ventures or cost sharing arrangements 
debt and debt service guarantees 
at june   the company had mortgage and other note obligations  subordinated notes  and other notes payable on the balance sheet totaling  the company currently does not have any off balance sheet debt service guarantees 
surety bonds and standby letters of credit 
as of june   the company had  in surety bonds and  in outstanding standby letters of credit in favor of local municipalities or financial institutions to guarantee the construction of real property improvements or financial obligations 
the  in surety bonds guarantee the construction of public improvements and infrastructure such as sewer  streets  traffic signals  grading  and wildlife preservations in connection with the various communities the company is developing 
surety bonds are commonly required by public agencies from homebuilders and other real estate developers 
the surety bonds and standby letters of credit are renewable and expire upon completion of the required improvements 
standby letters of credit are a form of credit enhancement that is commonly required in real estate development to secure the construction of public improvements 
in the past three fiscal years  no surety bonds or standby letters of credit have been drawn on for use to satisfy the company s obligations to perform under the agreements with the public agencies 
executed contracts for site work and construction activity 
the company has entered into site work and construction contracts with various suppliers and contractors 
these contracts are for construction and development activity in the numerous communities the company has under development  and are originated in the normal course of business 
the site work contracts generally require specific performance by the contractor to prepare the land for construction and are written on a community by community basis 
for larger communities  site work contracts are awarded in phases in order to limit any long term commitment by the company or its contractors 
generally  site work contracts are completed in less than one year 
the company acts as a general contractor and contracts with various subcontractors at specified prices for construction of the homes it sells 
subcontractors generally work on a piece meal basis and are not awarded contracts for a specified number of homes 
these commitments are typically funded by the company s revolving credit facility and cash from operations 
variable interest entities in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
the fasb issued a revised fin fin r in december which modifies and clarifies various aspects of the original interpretations 
a variable interest entity vie is created when i the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties or ii equity holders either a lack direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity  b are not obligated to absorb expected losses of the entity or c do not have the right to receive expected residual returns of the entity if they occur 
if an entity is deemed to be a vie  pursuant to fin r  an enterprise that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie is considered the primary beneficiary and must consolidate the vie 
based on the provisions of fin r  the company has concluded that whenever it enters into an option agreement to acquire land or lots from an entity and pays a significant deposit that is not unconditionally refundable  a vie is created under condition ii b of the previous paragraph 
the company has been deemed to have provided subordinated financial support  which refers to variable interests that will absorb some or all of an entity s expected theoretical losses if they occur 
for each vie created  the company will compute expected losses and residual returns based on the probability of future cash flows as outlined in fin r 
if the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the vie it will consolidate the vie on its balance sheet 
the fair value of the vies inventory will be reported as inventory not owned variable interest entities 
at june   the company consolidated ten vies as a result of its options to purchase land or lots from the selling entities 
the company paid cash or issued letters of credit deposits to these ten vies totaling  and incurred additional pre acquisition costs totaling  the company s deposits and any costs incurred prior to acquisition of the land or lots represent the company s maximum exposure to loss 
the fair value of the vies inventory is reported as inventory not owned variable interest entities 
the company recorded  in inventory not owned variable interest entities as of june  the fair value of the property to be acquired less cash deposits and pre acquisition costs  which totaled  at june   was reported on the balance sheet as obligations related to inventory not owned variable interest entities 
creditors  if any  of these vies have no recourse against the company 
the company will continue to secure land and lots using options 
including the deposits and other costs capitalized in connection with the vies discussed in the prior paragraph  the company had total costs incurred to acquire land and lots at june  of approximately  including  of cash deposits 
the total purchase price under these cancelable contracts or options is approximately  the maximum exposure to loss is limited to the deposits  although some deposits are refundable  and costs incurred prior to the acquisition of the land or lots 
summary of outstanding obligations the following table summarizes the company s outstanding obligations as of june  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on its liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
for mortgage and other note obligations  payments due by period are shown based on the expiration date of the loan 
payments due during fiscal year ending june  total payments due thereafter obligations mortgage and other note obligations operating leases affordable housing contributions total obligations the above table does not include certain obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business  such as trade payables 
the above table also does not include any amounts needed to acquire lots or land under option or cancelable purchase contracts because these arrangements are completed only at the company s discretion  subject only to loss of option or deposit amounts and costs capitalized to date 
therefore  these option and cancelable purchase contracts do not represent binding enforceable purchase obligations 
as of june   the company had contracted to purchase  or had under option  undeveloped land and improved building lots for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  that are expected to yield approximately  lots 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  impairment of real estate assets  capitalization of costs  environmental liability exposure  miscellaneous litigation reserves  and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
the fasb issued a revised fin fin r in december which modifies and clarifies various aspects of the original interpretations 
variable interest entities are entities controlled by another entity through means other than voting rights 
fin r provides guidance on determining whether and how a business enterprise should consolidate a variable interest entity 
fin r requires significant use of judgment and estimates in determining its application 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of fin r 
estimates 
impairment charges to reduce the company s real estate inventories to net realizable value and goodwill balances are recorded using several factors including management s plans for future operations  recent operating results and projected cash flows  which include assumptions related to expected future demand and market conditions 
the adequacy of the company s impairment charges could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home and community and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends 
should actual warranty experience change  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each subdivision and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 
revenue recognition 
the company primarily derives its total earned revenues from the sale of residential property 
the company recognizes residential revenue when title is conveyed to the homebuyer at the time of closing 
the company also sells developed and undeveloped land in bulk and under option agreements 
revenues from sales of land and other real estate are recognized when the company has received an adequate cash down payment and all other conditions necessary for profit recognition have been satisfied 
during fiscal  and  all sales transactions met the criteria for  and were accounted for  utilizing the full accrual method 
to the extent that certain sales or portions thereof do not meet all conditions necessary for profit recognition  the company would use other methods to recognize profit  including the percentage of completion  cost recovery and the deposit methods 
these methods of profit recognition defer a portion or all of the profit to the extent it is dependent upon the occurrence of future events 
also  in general  specific identification and relative sales value methods are used to determine the cost of sales 
management estimates of future costs to be incurred after the completion of each sale are included in cost of sales 
a change in circumstances that causes these estimates of future costs to increase or decrease significantly would affect the gain or loss recognized on future sales 
impairment 
the company assesses the impairment of its real estate assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable 
indicators the company considers important  which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner in which an asset is used  and an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to construct an asset 
real estate is stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value using the methodology described as follows 
a write down to estimated fair value is recorded when the company determines that the net book value exceeds the estimated selling prices less cost to sell 
these evaluations are made on a property by property basis 
when the company determines that the net book value of an asset may not be recoverable based upon the estimated undiscounted cash flow  an impairment write down is recorded 
values from comparable property sales will also be considered 
the evaluation of future cash flows and fair value of individual properties requires significant judgment and assumptions  including estimates of market value  development absorption  and remaining development costs 
significant adverse changes in circumstances affecting these judgments and assumptions in future periods could cause a significant impairment adjustment to be recorded 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure and discussion of impairment of real estate assets 
capitalization of costs 
costs capitalized include direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest on indebtedness  real estate taxes  insurance  construction overhead and indirect project costs 
costs previously capitalized related to any abandoned development opportunities are written off when it is determined such costs will not provide any future benefits 
any decrease in development activity may result in a portion of capitalized costs being expensed 
environmental liability exposure 
development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on the company s part as owner and developer  for its own acts as well as the acts of prior owners of the subject property or owners or past owners of adjacent parcels 
if hazardous substances are discovered on or emanating from any of its properties  the company and prior owners may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances 
the company generally undertakes environmental studies in connection with its property acquisitions 
in the event the company incurs environmental remediation costs  including clean up costs  consulting fees for environmental studies and investigations  monitoring costs  and legal costs relating to clean up  litigation defense  and the pursuit of responsible third parties  if these costs are incurred in connection with properties the company previously sold  then they are expensed 
the company capitalizes costs relating to land under development and undeveloped land as part of development costs 
costs incurred for properties to be sold are deferred and charged to cost of sales when the properties are sold 
should a previously undetected  substantial environmental hazard be found on the company s properties  significant liquidity could be consumed by the resulting clean up requirements and a material expense may be recorded 
further  governmental regulation on environmental matters affecting residential development could impose substantial additional expense on the company  which could adversely affect its results of operations or the value of properties owned under contract  or purchased by the company 
for additional information regarding risks associated with environmental hazards and environmental regulation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate income taxes 
estimates are based on interpretation of tax laws 
the company estimates actual current tax due and assesses temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  the adjustments would be included within the tax provision in the statement of operations and or balance sheet 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position and results of operations and liquidity

effective july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees sfas 
the company selected the prospective method of adoption as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
effective july  the company adopted sfas no 
r share based payment  revised sfas r which eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards with limited exceptions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure and discussion of stock based compensation 
in december  the fasb revised sfas through the issuance of sfas no 
r share based payment  revised 
sfas r was effective for the company commencing july  sfas r  among other things  eliminates the alternative to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires entities to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the fair value based method in sfas r is similar to the fair value based method in sfas in most respects  subject to certain key differences 
as the company previously adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas prospectively for all stock awards granted  commencing on july   the impact of the modified prospective adoption of sfas r did not have a significant impact on the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company amortizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of each option grant 
the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the compensation expense associated with stock options 
recent accounting pronouncements accounting for financial statement misstatements in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
the roll over method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
the company currently uses the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the iron curtain and the roll over methods 
sab permits existing public companies to initially apply its provisions either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
the company applied the provisions of sab using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of its annual financial statements for the fiscal year ending june  the application of sab did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting for defined benefit pensions and other postretirement benefits in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
sfas requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize the changes in that funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
in addition  sfas requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
the effective date for the adoption of sfas for publicly traded companies is as of the end of the fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted sfas as of june  and its impact is to eliminate the company s intangible asset that was recognized in connection with the application of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas  reduce the company s other comprehensive income  and increase the company s accrued expenses 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure and discussion of the company s supplemental executive retirement plan 
accounting for income taxes in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin prescribes a more likely than not recognition threshold as well as a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin in december  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction on qualified production activities provided by the american jobs creation act of fsp fas 
fsp fas clarifies that the deduction will be treated as a special deduction as described in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as such  the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment 
the impact of the deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed 
the company files a consolidated return on a calendar year 
accordingly  the company began reflecting the special deduction with respect to its operations effective january  its impact was to lower the effective tax provision in the periods in which the deduction was claimed and that this benefit will increase as the deduction is phased in under the statute 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas will be effective for the company s fiscal year ending june  the company is currently evaluating this standard and has not yet determined what impact it would have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas provides an entity with the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
under the fair value option  an entity will report unrealized gains and losses on those items at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for the company is the fiscal year ending june  we are currently evaluating this standard and have not yet determined what impact  if any  the fair value option would have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company  due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and interest rates 
the company s principal market risk exposure continues to be interest rate risk 
a majority of the company s debt is variable based on libor  and  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
based on current operations  an increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points will result in a corresponding increase or decrease in cost of sales and interest charges incurred by the company of approximately  in a fiscal year  a portion of which will be capitalized and included in cost of sales as homes are delivered 
the company believes that reasonably possible near term interest rate changes will not result in a material negative effect on future earnings  fair values or cash flows of the company 
generally  the company has been able to recover any increased costs of borrowing through increased selling prices  however  there is no assurance the company will be able to continue to increase selling prices to cover the effects of any increase in near term interest rates 
changes in the prices of commodities that are a significant component of home construction costs  particularly lumber  may result in unexpected short term increases in construction costs 
since the sales price of the company s homes is fixed at the time the buyer enters into a contract to acquire a home and because the company generally contracts to sell its homes before construction begins  any increase in costs in excess of those anticipated may result in gross margins lower than anticipated for the homes in the company s backlog 
the company attempts to mitigate the market risks of price fluctuation of commodities by entering into fixed price contracts with its subcontractors and material suppliers for a specified period of time  generally commensurate with the building cycle
