overview urologix  inc  based in minneapolis  develops  manufactures and markets minimally invasive medical products for the treatment of urological disorders 
we have developed technology for the treatment of bph  a disease that affects more than million men worldwide 
we market our control units under the targis  prostatron and coolwave names and our procedure kits under the ctc  targis and prostaprobe names 
we are also in the process of developing our next generation catheter  coolmax  in which we are planning to combine durability with increased patient comfort 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter  we implemented an end of life plan for our prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters which will result in us exiting this product line over approximately the next years 
all systems utilize the company s cooled thermotherapy technology  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without anesthesia or intravenous sedation and can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe that cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph with results clinically superior to medication and without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the continued adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy will be keys to obtaining such reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive cooled thermotherapy treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
beginning on august   the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms replaced the reasonable cost basis of reimbursement for outpatient hospital based procedures  including cooled thermotherapy  with a new fixed rate or prospective payment system 
under this method of reimbursement  a hospital receives a fixed reimbursement for each cooled thermotherapy treatment performed in its facility  approximately  in calendar year  although the rate varies depending on a wage index and other factors for each hospital 
the urologist performing the cooled thermotherapy treatment receives reimbursement of approximately per procedure 
in january  cms began to reimburse for cooled thermotherapy treatments performed in the urologist s office 
the reimbursement rate inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office is approximately  compared to  in calendar  which is subject to geographic adjustment 
reimbursement rates for calendar year will be published in the november edition of the federal register 

table of contents in july  cms added the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy to the asc list of medicare approved procedures providing a reimbursement rate for ambulatory surgical centers asc 
as a result  procedures performed in an asc were reimbursed under a two part system similar to hospitals the asc received a fixed fee of approximately  the highest amount allowable under this system  while the urologist performing the procedure was reimbursed the same amount as if the treatment occurred in a hospital  approximately the relatively low facility reimbursement relative to the cost of the procedure potentially limited the number of cooled thermotherapy treatments done in an asc 
effective july  the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy was deleted from the asc list of medicare approved procedures 
as a result  effective with that change  urologists who performed cooled thermotherapy procedures in an asc are reimbursed at the office based reimbursement rates  approximately  in calendar year  subject to geographic adjustment 
private insurance companies and hmos make their own determinations regarding coverage and reimbursement based upon usual and customary fees 
to date  we have received coverage and reimbursement in various geographies from private insurance companies and hmos throughout the united states 
we intend to continue our efforts to gain coverage and reimbursement across the united states 
there can be no assurance that we will receive favorable coverage or reimbursement determinations for cooled thermotherapy from these payers or that amounts reimbursed to physicians for performing cooled thermotherapy procedures will be sufficient to encourage physicians to use cooled thermotherapy 
internationally  reimbursement approvals for the cooled thermotherapy procedure are awarded on an individual country basis 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is i educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of cooledthermotherapy compared to other treatment options  ii increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  iii increase the number of physicians who provide cooled thermotherapy to their patients  iv efficiently provide more physicians with access to cooled thermotherapy through the expansion of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service in the united states  and v increase the use of cooled thermotherapy for the treatment of bph in international markets 
we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing programs  the expansion of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service and research and development and clinical trials as we focus on growing revenues and continuing to improve our therapy 
in addition  we received fda approval for our coolwave control unit which we launched in july of our future profitability will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving increased treatment volume and market adoption of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  including treatments delivered through our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  as well as the risk of fda mandated recall of our products  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the fact that our products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in physicians offices  hospitals  and ambulatory surgery centers and the amount of reimbursement provided 
critical accounting policies in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy system control units upon delivery to the customer 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy system control units with customers under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use  and also provide access to cooled thermotherapy treatments via our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
we retain title to the control units placed with our customers for evaluation and longer term use and do not recognize any revenue on these control units until title has transferred 
these programs  as well as our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
revenue from our mobile service is recognized upon treatment of the patient 
revenue from the sale of single use treatment catheters is recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue for warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period and revenue subject to certain sales incentives is deferred based upon the contract provisions 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and specific customer based circumstances 
should actual sales returns differ from our estimates  revisions to the sales return reserve would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we consider factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
accounts receivable are charged off after management determines they are uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on the first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
at june   we recorded a  write down of our prostatron control unit and prostaprobe catheter inventory as a result of the implementation of an end of life plan for this product family 

table of contents valuation of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill at june   the carrying value of goodwill was million 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value which are based on various valuation techniques including projected future cash flows and our market capitalization 
the assumptions used in estimating fair value represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as of june   identifiable intangible assets consist of customer base  developed technologies  trademarks and patents of    and  respectively 
we review identifiable intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter  we implemented an end of life plan for our prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters which resulted in asset impairment charges related to our identifiable intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets of  these charges consisted of a  write down of developed technologies  a  write down of customer base  and a  write down of trademarks 
the remaining balances of the developed technologies and trademarks are being amortized using the straight line method over the next years  their estimated remaining useful lives 
the remaining balance of the customer base is being amortized using the straight line method over the next years  its estimated remaining useful life 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
based on management s assessment of evidence  including the net loss in fiscal  and in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we recorded million of tax expense at june  to increase our valuation allowance which had been reduced at the end of fiscal to fully reserve our deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination 
we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
at june   we carried a valuation allowance of million against our remaining deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense on all stock option awards granted subsequent to july   as well as on any existing awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after july  in addition  compensation expense is recognized on the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to july  the amount of compensation expense is based on the fair value of the option award at the date of grant and is recognized over the requisite service period which corresponds to the option vesting period 
options typically vest percent after the first year of service with the remaining vesting th each month thereafter 
generally  options granted to non employee directors are immediately exercisable at the date of grant 
options are priced based on the closing price of a share of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the 
table of contents black scholes option pricing model 
to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model we use historical data to estimate expected volatility and the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the range of these assumptions and the range of option pricing and number of options granted at the different grant dates will impact our calculation of the fair value of the awards and will therefore impact the amount of expense reflected in our statement of operations for any given period 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales from fiscal is primarily due to reduced orders from our direct accounts  which includes both direct office and third party mobile accounts  as well as reduced average selling prices asp s for our disposable treatment catheters as a result of pricing pressures created by competition and reduced reimbursement rates 
this decrease in sales from direct accounts was partially offset by an increase in sales of from our mobile services that began operations in september the introduction of our mobile services operations in september had a direct impact to our overall sales mix 
during fiscal  percent of sales were derived from treatment catheters  compared to percent in the prior fiscal year  while our mobile treatments comprised percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the remaining percent of our sales in fiscal were from sales of our control units and warranty service contracts 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  amortization related to developed technologies  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily due to million in asset impairment charges related to developed technologies and prostatron fixed assets  as well as a  write down of prostatron inventory as a result of the implementation of an end of life plan for our prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit margin rates decreased as a result of the asset impairment charges and inventory write down mentioned above  and the remaining decrease resulted from decreased sales and production volume of our treatment catheters  which provide a smaller base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs  an increase in the number of mobile unit treatments  which have lower overall margins  increases in overall material costs  as well as increased costs during the three month period ended september  related to the resolution of manufacturing issues identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal these manufacturing issues did not continue into the rest of fiscal selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense is largely the result of a decrease in wages  benefits  commissions  and travel largely due to a decrease in our sales  the size of our sales force  and a decrease in advertising and promotional expense associated with the launch of the new coolwave control unit 
these expense reductions were partially offset by increased legal  audit and consulting fees when compared to the prior fiscal year  as well as  of severance expense as a result of a headcount reduction in june 
table of contents research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  remained relatively flat at million in both fiscal and research and development expenses for fiscal relate primarily to expenditures incurred in development of our next generation catheter  as compared with the prior year when expenditures related primarily to activities related to our next generation coolwave control unit 
amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets increased to  in fiscal compared to amortization of  in fiscal the increase in amortization and impairment expense is the result of the implementation of an end of life plan at june  for the prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter 
this decision resulted in asset impairment charges  in accordance with sfas no 
 of  related to the prostatron customer base and  related to the prostatron trademarks 
net interest income net interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recorded million of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june   compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal this increase is a result of our recording million of tax expense at june  to increase our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
at the end of fiscal  we had reduced our valuation allowance and recorded an income tax benefit of million as we had determined that it was more likely than not that we will be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
at june   we increased our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets that would not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period based on management s assessment of evidence  including the net loss in fiscal in addition to the million of tax expense to increase our valuation allowance  we also recorded  of income tax expense during the fiscal year related to state taxes 
our fiscal tax expense of  plus some minor amounts for state income taxes  is expected to be primarily non cash and will represent the indefinite lived deferred tax liability which can not be offset against definite lived deferred tax assets resulting from the amortization of goodwill for tax purposes 
fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales increased slightly to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the modest sales growth from fiscal to fiscal is attributable to sales from our cooled thermotherapy mobile service which was launched in september this increase was partially offset by a decrease in average per unit selling prices of single use treatment catheters primarily due to increased competition for the office based bph treatment 
sales of our single use treatment catheters and mobile treatments accounted for approximately of our revenue for the fiscal year ended june  compared to approximately of revenue in fiscal cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  amortization 
table of contents related to developed technologies  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold is primarily the result of an increase in the number of treatment catheters sold  additional costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service that was launched in september  an increase in manufacturing variances as a result of manufacturing challenges incurred in the second half of fiscal  as well as approximately  of equity based compensation expense related to the adoption of sfas no 
r on july  gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in gross profit rates is primarily the result of decreased year over year average per unit selling prices of our single use treatment catheters  lower overall margins on our mobile unit treatments  as well as the fourth quarter manufacturing variances and the equity based compensation expense mentioned above 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is largely the result of million of equity based compensation expense  as well as increased expenses associated with sales and marketing programs designed to increase the awareness of cooled thermotherapy 
research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased slightly to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in expenses is primarily from decreased expenditures on product development activities related to our coolwave control unit 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased to  in fiscal from  fiscal the increase in amortization expense is the result of the determination in the fourth quarter of fiscal to begin amortizing our previous indefinite lived trademark on a straight line basis over its estimated remaining life of years at april  the decision to begin amortizing our trademark  which represents the prostatron and tumt trademarks acquired from edap on october   was due to the approval of the coolwave control unit and our intent to focus marketing on this control unit and trademark  and due to the fact that we are not planning to manufacturing additional prostatron control units 
net interest income net interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase is due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recognized an income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense of  in fiscal historically we have carried a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  the majority of which represent net operating loss tax carry forwards which we generated prior to achieving profitability 
based upon management s assessment of all available evidence  including our cumulative net income for fiscal years  and  and estimates of future profitability and the overall prospects of our business  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  and as a result recorded a million income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal the deferred tax benefit of million was partially offset by  of income tax expense related to federal alternative minimum taxes and state taxes on fiscal pre tax income for financial statement purposes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of june  the increase in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities compared to million is fiscal primarily as a result of decreases in accounts receivable of million due to improved collection efforts and reduced revenue during fiscal this increase in cash from operating activities was partially offset by our net loss of million  adjusted for million of long lived asset impairments  a million increase in our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation expense  as well as decreases in inventories of  which consists of a  increase in overall inventory offset by  of transfers of control units to fixed assets  and decreases in our accounts payable of  the increase in overall inventory is primarily the result of increased finished goods in anticipation of greater sales levels than were achieved in fiscal year this increase was offset by a portion of inventory transferred to property and equipment in support of our customer evaluation and long term use programs and to support the expansion of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
the decrease in accounts payable is mainly due to the timing of receipts and payments of vendor goods and services 
cash used for investing activities we used  for investing activities as a result of the purchase of property and equipment largely to support the growth of our mobile initiative and as a result of patent fees incurred 
cash provided by financing activities during fiscal we generated  from financing activities as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and longer term use of our cooled thermotherapy system control units in addition to purchase options  as well as grow our mobile service which provides physicians and patients with efficient access to our cooled thermotherapy system control units on a pre scheduled basis 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units used in evaluation or long term use programs and units used in our company owned mobile service 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance these programs 
future contractual commitments  including interest  that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands building and equipment leases we are currently in the process of negotiating a three year renewal on our building lease 
we believe our million in cash and cash equivalents at june   together with the funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital resources needs for at least the next months 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for us beginning on july  while we are still evaluating the impact the adoption of this pronouncement will have on our financial statements  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial statements given our historical losses 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards  except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
this statement is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements  but imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements 
the provisions under sfas no 
are effective for us beginning on july  we are still evaluating the impact the adoption of this pronouncement will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities including and amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the provisions under sfas no 
are effective for us beginning on july  we believe that the adoption of this pronouncement will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and was not materially different from the quarter end carrying value 
due to the nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
