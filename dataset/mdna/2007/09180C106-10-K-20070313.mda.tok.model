item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of february  we owned and operated restaurants located in california  oregon  colorado  arizona  texas and nevada 
in addition we have one licensed restaurant in lahaina  maui 
each of our restaurants is operated either as a bj s restaurant brewery  a bj s restaurant brewhouse  or a bj s pizza grill restaurant 
our menu features our award winning  signature deep dish pizza  our own handcrafted beers as well as a wide selection of appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
the first bj s restaurant was opened in orange county  california in as a small full service restaurant focusing on chicago style deep dish pizza 
in our current co chairmen assumed the operations of the restaurants and in purchased the restaurants from the original founders 
in  the company opened its first large format restaurant and brewery in brea  california and began to expand the menu to include appetizers  entrees  pastas  sandwiches  specialty salads and desserts 
as of february   we operated bj s restaurant brewery restaurants that manufacture our beer for our restaurants  bj s restaurant brewhouse restaurants  which are identical to our brewery restaurants except that they do not manufacture their own beer and seven bj s pizza grill restaurants  which are primarily our original legacy restaurants 
our growth will focus on our bj s restaurant brewhouse  however  we may continue to build additional bj s restaurant brewery locations in certain areas where we believe it may be more appropriate to brew our own beer 
we also have contract brewing arrangements in which we utilize the excess capacity of other highly qualified craft brewers to produce our hand crafted beers under our proprietary recipes in we purchased additional restaurants in oregon and washington from pietro s corp pietro s to expand our presence in the northwest 
the pietro s restaurants primarily served thin crust pizza in a very casual counter service environment 
over the next eight years we closed of the pietro s restaurants and converted three restaurants to bj s locations 
on march   we sold the remaining three pietro s restaurants to employees of those restaurants 
we intend to continue developing bj s restaurants in high profile locations within densely populated areas in both existing and new markets 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our relatively high average sales per productive square foot  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases for our mature restaurants 
therefore  we expect that the majority of our year over year revenue growth will come from new restaurant openings 
newly opened restaurants experience higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for approximately their first to days of operations in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our mature restaurants 
accordingly  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on restaurant opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and occupancy and operating expenses 
our revenues are comprised of food and beverage sales at our restaurant 
revenues from restaurant sales are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale 
revenues from our gift cards are recognized upon redemption in our restaurants 
until the redemption of gift cards occurs  all outstanding balances on such cards are included as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
cost of sales is comprised of food and beverage supplies 
the components of cost of sales are variable and typically fluctuate with sales volumes 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses and payroll taxes and fringe benefits for restaurant employees 

table of contents occupancy and operating expenses include restaurant supplies  credit card fees  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
occupancy and operating expenses generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate  field supervision and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
restaurant opening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial work force for each new restaurant  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statements of income expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year consolidated statements of income data revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor and benefits occupancy operating expenses general and administrative depreciation and amortization restaurant opening expense gain on sale of pietro s restaurants total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense interest income expense  net other income expense  net total other income expense income before taxes income tax expense net income fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the million increase in revenues consisted of an approximate million increase in restaurant sales from new restaurants not in our comparable sales base for the prior period  and an approximate million or increase from comparable restaurant sales  offset by  of additional revenues in fiscal due to the two additional operating days in that year 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales benefited from a menu price increase of approximately with the rest due to increased customer counts and menu mix shifts 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to for the current week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily a result of increased costs for seafood and produce  partially offset by the impact of menu price increases 
additionally  in our new restaurants  our cost of sales will typically be higher during the first days of operations versus our mature restaurants  as management teams become accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing sales volumes we expect at our restaurants 

table of contents we provide our customers a large variety of menu items and therefore we are not overly dependent on a single group of commodities 
we continue to work with our suppliers to control food costs  however  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurants will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase was primarily due to the opening of new restaurants since the weeks ended january  as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs decreased to for the current week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this percentage decrease is primarily due to increased leverage of the fixed component of our labor costs resulting from higher sales  coupled with improved hourly labor productivity which we believe resulted from our new web based labor scheduling and analysis system that was introduced during the first half of for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes expected at our restaurants 
beginning in fiscal  we implemented a performance based equity incentive plan  bj s gold standard stock ownership plan  for our restaurant general managers  executive kitchen managers and field supervision personnel 
the new equity incentive plan consists of awards of restricted stock units that will require five year service and performance commitments 
the annualized non cash pre tax compensation expense associated with these awards is estimated to be approximately  for fiscal occupancy and operating expenses 
occupancy and operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the increase reflects additional operating and occupancy expenses related to the new restaurants we opened since the weeks ended january  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy and operating expenses increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily due to higher energy costs and increased dining and kitchen supplies partially offset by our ability to leverage the fixed nature of many of these costs as a result of higher comparable sales 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of included in general and administrative costs for the weeks ended january  is million of stock based compensation expense related to the adoption of statement no 
r  share based payment in january excluding this amount  general and administrative costs increased million  or 
this increase was the result of our planned investments in field supervision and corporate infrastructure to support our growth coupled with higher restaurant management recruiting and training costs 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
approximately basis points of this percentage increase is the result of stock based compensation due to the adoption of statement no 
r in january  with the remaining basis points increase being due primarily to the factors noted above 
beginning in fiscal  we relocated our corporate office to a larger leased facility to support our future growth 
in connection with this relocation  we will incur approximately  of additional rent expense in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment related to new restaurant development 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased to for the week period from for the prior year comparable week period 
this increase is primarily due to increased construction costs for new restaurants and depreciation on our new operating systems 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of during the weeks ended january  and january   we opened and nine restaurants  respectively 
this increase is primarily due to additional restaurants compared to prior year end and construction rent expensed in the more recent period as a result of our adoption of fasb statement of position no 
fsp  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period effective january our opening costs will fluctuate from period to period  depending upon  but not limited to  the number of restaurant openings  the size and concept of the restaurants being opened  the location of the restaurants  the rental costs of the restaurants and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased by  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the comparable week period of this increase is primarily due to increased investments after the completion of our private placements in march and november coupled with higher interest rates this year compared to last year 
other income  net 
net other income decreased to  during comparable weeks ended january  from  during the comparable week period of  a decrease of  this decrease is primarily due to our decision to discontinue lottery ticket sales in our oregon restaurants 

table of contents income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the comparable week period of the effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to fica tip credits and the non deductibility of incentive stock options 
we currently estimate our effective tax rate to be approximately to for fiscal however  the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  pre tax income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal year weeks compared to fiscal year weeks revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the million increase in revenues consisted of an approximate million increase in restaurant sales from the opening of new restaurants  and an approximate million or increase from comparable restaurant sales 
the comparable restaurant sales benefited from a menu price increase of approximately with the majority of the increase due to increased customer counts 
these revenue increases were partially offset by approximate million of restaurant sales related to our three pietro s restaurants and our seal beach bj s pizza grill restaurant  which were closed on march  and january   respectively 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this increase is primarily a result of increased costs for meat  produce  seafood  general grocery items and fuel surcharges from our distributors partially offset by a reduction in poultry and cheese costs and the impact of menu price increases 
labor and benefits 
labor and benefit costs for our restaurants increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase was primarily due to the opening of nine new restaurants  partially offset by the closing of our pietro s and seal beach restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues  labor and benefit costs increased to for the current week period from for the prior year week period 
this percentage increase is primarily due to higher management labor as a result of our decision to improve our management staffing levels and inefficiencies experienced with the nine new restaurants we opened in compared to the seven new restaurants we opened in the in occupancy operating expenses 
occupancy operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the increase reflects additional operating occupancy expenses related to the nine new restaurants we opened in  partially offset by the decrease in costs associated with our three pietro s restaurants that were sold on march  and the closure of our seal beach bj s pizza grill restaurant on january  as a percentage of revenues  occupancy operating expenses decreased to for the week period from for the prior year week period 
this decrease is primarily due to lower rent payments as a result of two land purchases in which we therefore pay no rent and a higher mix of ground leased locations versus both ground and building leased locations 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase was the result of planned investments in our field supervision and corporate support infrastructure to support our growth 
during  we expect to continue to add resources to the corporate support and field supervision activities in preparation for the planned openings of as many as new restaurants 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the week period from for the prior year week period 
this percentage decrease is primarily the result of our continued ability to leverage the fixed nature of many of these costs over our increased revenues and the absence of severance payments to three corporate employees which were expensed during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of restaurant equipment  furniture  leasehold improvements and brewery equipment related to new restaurant development 
restaurant opening expense 
restaurant opening expense increased by million  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from million during the week period of this increase is primarily due to opening costs related to nine restaurant openings and four restaurants in progress during the weeks ended january   as compared to seven restaurant openings and two restaurants in progress during the week period of gain on sale of pietro s restaurants 
in fiscal  we sold our three pietro s restaurants resulting in a million pre tax gain 

table of contents interest income  net 
net interest income increased by  or  to million during the weeks ended january  from  during the week period of this increase is primarily due to increased investments after the completion of our private placement on march  coupled with higher interest rates 
other income  net 
net other income decreased to  during weeks ended january  from  during the week period of  a decrease of  this decrease is primarily due to the loss of gaming income from our pietro s restaurants  which we sold on march  income tax expense 
our effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  was compared to for the week period of the effective income tax rate for the weeks ended january  differs from the statutory income tax rate primarily due to fica tip credits 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant growth plans 
while our ability to achieve our growth plans is dependent on a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control  our primary growth objective is to achieve a to increase in total restaurant operating weeks during each of fiscal and from the development and opening of new restaurants 
our base of established restaurant operations is not yet large enough to generate enough free cash flow from operations to totally fund our planned expansion 
similar to many restaurant chains  we typically utilize operating lease arrangements principally ground leases for substantially all of our restaurant locations 
however  from time to time  we may be required to purchase the underlying land for a new restaurant if that is the only way to secure a highly desirable site 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform certain site related work and to construct and equip our restaurant buildings 
we opened new restaurants during fiscal and we currently expect to open as many as new restaurants during fiscal we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while our operating lease obligations are not currently required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheets  the minimum rents and other related lease obligations  such as common area expenses  under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and brewery operations and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or credit cards at the time of the sale 
thus  we are able to sell many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items 
our cash flows from operating activities  as detailed in the consolidated statements of cash flows  provided million of net cash during the weeks ended january   a million increase from the million generated during the week period of the increase in cash from operating activities for the weeks ended january   in comparison to weeks ended january   is primarily due to the timing of payments to vendors included in accounts payable and accrued expenses  increased net income  higher depreciation expense due to more restaurants  and non cash stock based compensation expense  partially offset by the change in deferred taxes and the timing of prepaid expenditures 
for the weeks ended january   total capital expenditures were million of which expenditures for the acquisition of land  restaurant and brewery equipment and leasehold improvements to construct new restaurants were million 
these expenditures were primarily related to the construction of our new restaurants opened by the end of the fiscal year as well as approximately million of expenditures related to six additional restaurants expected to open in the first and second quarters of in addition  total capital expenditures related to the maintenance of existing restaurants and expenditures related to restaurant and corporate systems were million and million  respectively 
on november   we sold  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share for million net of approximately million in related fees and expenses  and  on march   we sold  shares of common stock at a purchase price of per share for million net of approximately million in related fees and expenses 
these proceeds are currently being utilized to fund the expansion of our restaurant operations and general corporate purposes 
on december   we established a million unsecured revolving line of credit the line of credit which expires on december  availability under the line of credit is reduced by outstanding letters of credit primarily supporting our self insurance programs 
as of january   there were no funded borrowings outstanding under the line of credit  however there was million outstanding in letters of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit will bear interest at per annum in excess of the applicable libor rate 
prior to the march equity offering  we funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flows from operations and proceeds received from the exercise of redeemable warrants during as of february   we have entered into signed leases or purchase agreements  of which the restaurants have not yet began operations  and we expect to enter into additional leases for new restaurant locations 
our capital requirements related to opening additional restaurants will continue to be significant 
we currently anticipate our capital 
table of contents expenditures for to be approximately million related to the construction of our new restaurants  one land purchase for restaurant development  and the reinvestment in some of our older restaurants as well as normal maintenance capital expenditures and the investment in our restaurant toolsets 
we expect to fund these expenditures with our current cash and investment balances and our cash flow from operations 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the lease and associated financing arrangements negotiated with landlords 
based upon our current expansion plan  we believe that our current cash flow and our cash and investments balances together with anticipated cash flows from operations should be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our future growth and operations 
there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when required or available on terms acceptable to us 
sale of pietro s restaurants in february  we executed an agreement to sell our three pietro s restaurants effective on march   resulting in a million pre tax gain 
the buyers  formerly employees  purchased the restaurant assets and related trademarks for the pietro s brand 
the million sales price includes cash proceeds of million and two notes receivable from the buyers totaling  with terms of five and ten years 
the ten year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent with a minimum interest rate of and a maximum interest rate of and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the ten year term 
the five year note is in the amount of  bears interest at prime plus one percent and requires fixed monthly payments of principal and interest over the five year term 
our notes are subordinated to the buyer s sba loan 
principal payments to the company on both notes were prohibited for the first six months by the buyer s sba loan 
for these three pietro s restaurants sold  sales were  and  and pre tax income was  and  for the thirteen weeks ended march  and march   respectively 
the net book value of the assets sold as of march  was  off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow limited purposes 
as of january   we are not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our operations 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
minimum wages have been increased numerous times and remain subject to future increases 
while we have been able to react to inflation and other changes in our costs of key operating expenses by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  combined with reduced purchasing costs  and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
we cannot guarantee that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
many of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and adverse weather our results of operations have historically been impacted by seasonality  which directly impacts tourism at our coastal california locations 
the summer months june through august have traditionally been higher volume periods than other periods of the year 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated restaurant opening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management and are important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost 
property and equipment accounting requires estimates of the useful lives for the assets for depreciation purposes and selection of depreciation methods 
we believe the useful lives reflect the actual economic life of the underlying assets 
we have elected to use the straight line method of depreciation over the estimated useful life of an asset or the primary lease term of the respective lease  whichever is shorter 
renewals and betterments that materially extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized while maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
judgment is often required in the decision to distinguish between an asset which qualifies for capitalization versus an expenditure which is for maintenance and repairs 
we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant level for indicators of impairment 
if impairment indicators were identified  then assets would be recorded at fair value 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of january   no impairment indicators have been identified 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our employee workers compensation program 
we maintain coverage with a third party insurer to limit our total exposure for this program 
the accrued liability associated with this program is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr claims as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on information provided by our insurance broker and insurer  combined with our judgments regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  our claims development history  case jurisdiction  related legislation  and our claims settlement practice 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr claims as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be significantly impacted 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
we usually file our income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
we file our tax returns with the advice and compilation of tax consultants 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretation of the tax laws 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires projection of our taxable income into future years to determine if there will be taxable income sufficient to realize the tax assets future tax deductions and fica tax credit carryforwards 
the preparation of the projections requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
leases we lease the majority of our restaurant locations 
we account for our leases under the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases sfas which require that our leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases pursuant to the requirements of sfas we disburse cash for leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures and equipment to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that may be reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions can take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us or a combination thereof 
all tenant improvement allowances received by us are recorded as a deferred rent obligation and amortized over the term of the lease 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the pre opening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as pre opening expense 
beginning january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date as pre opening expense  in accordance with fasb staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 

table of contents there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater pre opening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in some variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
stock based compensation we have two stock based compensation plans the equity incentive plan and the stock option plan under which we may issue shares of our common stock to employees  officers  directors and consultants 
upon effectiveness of the equity incentive plan  the stock option plan was closed for purposes of new grants 
both of these plans have been approved by our shareholders 
prior to january   we accounted for those plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation statement no 

no stock based employee compensation cost was recognized in our statement of income for fiscal years   and as all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r  share based payment statement no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized in fiscal includes  a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of statement no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement no 
r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
statement no r requires us to make certain assumptions and judgments regarding the grant date fair value 
these judgments include expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected option life  dividend yield and vesting percentage 
these estimations and judgments are determined by us using many different variables that  in many cases  are outside of our control 
the changes in these variables or trends  including stock price volatility and risk free interest rate  may significantly impact the grant date fair value resulting in a significant impact to our financial results 
prior to the adoption of statement no 
r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in our statement of cash flows 
statement no 
r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits resulting from tax deductions in excess of the compensation cost recognized for those options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies to accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
the adoption of this statement will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement requires companies to recognize a net liability or asset and an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other 
table of contents comprehensive income to report the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the statement requires prospective application  and the recognition and disclosure requirements are effective for companies with fiscal years ending after december  additionally  statement no 
requires companies to measure plan assets and obligations at their year end balance sheet date 
this requirement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we do not expect the impact of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance regarding the consideration given to prior year misstatements when determining materiality in current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  and had no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle is recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our financial statements 
in march  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting sales taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
if taxes are significant  an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amounts of taxes 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present revenues net of sales taxes 
this issue will not impact the method for presenting these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations as of january   including estimated cash payments due by period in thousands 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years contractual obligations operating leases purchase obligations total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit for more detailed description of our operating leases  refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to cash and cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than twelve months as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for the weeks ended january   the average interest rate earned on cash and cash equivalents and investments was approximately 
as of january   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents  of approximately million 
currently  the carrying amount of these securities approximates fair market value 
however  the fair market value of these securities is subject to interest rate risk and would decline in value if market interest rates increased 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels existing as of january   the decline in the 
table of contents fair value of the portfolio would not be material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  if interest rates decreased and securities within our portfolio matured and were re invested in securities with lower interest rates  interest income would decrease in the future 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
