corporate expenses consist of the company s enterprise shared service cost centers  and include  among other items  information technology  human resources  accounting and finance  legal  executive and customer service center functions  as well as stock based compensation 
in order to leverage the company s infrastructure  these functions are operated under a centralized management platform  providing support services throughout the organization 
the costs of these functions  other than those of the customer service center  which are allocated directly to the above categories based upon usage  are included within corporate expenses as they are not directly allocable to a specific category 
performance is measured based on category contribution margin or category ebitda  reflecting only the direct controllable revenue and operating expenses of the categories 
as such  management s measure of profitability for these categories does not include the effect of corporate overhead  described above  nor does it include depreciation and amortization  other income net  and income taxes 
management utilizes ebitda as a performance measurement tool because it considers such information a meaningful supplemental measure of its performance and believes it is frequently used by the investment community in the evaluation of companies with comparable market capitalization 
the company also uses ebitda as one of the factors used to determine the total amount of bonuses available to be awarded to executive officers and other employees 
the company s credit agreement uses ebitda with additional adjustments to measure compliance with covenants such as interest coverage and debt incurrence 
ebitda is also used by the company to evaluate and price potential acquisition candidates 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company s results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are a ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  the company s working capital needs  b ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on the company s debts  and c although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such capital expenditures 
because of these limitations  ebitda should only be used on a supplemental basis combined with gaap results when evaluating the company s performance

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of flowers 
com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by e commerce operations from the company s online and telephonic sales channels as well as other operations retail wholesale and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
shipping terms are fob shipping point 
net revenues generated by the company s bloomnet wire service operations include membership fees as well as other products and service offerings to florists 
membership fees are recognized monthly in the period earned  and products sales are recognized upon product shipment with shipping terms of fob shipping point 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers or franchisees to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers or franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company performs an annual impairment test as of the first day of its fiscal fourth quarter  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  to evaluate goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  the company reviews both quantitative as well as qualitative factors to support its assumptions with regard to fair value 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r requires the measurement of stock based compensation expense based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant 
the company determines the fair value of stock options issued by using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model considers a range of assumptions related to volatility  dividend yield  risk free interest rate and employee exercise behavior 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock price 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and future expectations 
the risk free interest rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the black scholes model also incorporates expected forfeiture rates  based on historical behavior 
determining these assumptions are subjective and complex  and therefore  a change in the assumptions utilized could impact the calculation of the fair value of the company s stock options 
income taxes the company has established deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company has recognized as a deferred tax asset the tax benefits associated with losses related to operations  which are expected to result in a future tax benefit 
realization of this deferred tax asset assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income so that these assets will be realized 
the factors that we consider in assessing the likelihood of realization include the forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets
