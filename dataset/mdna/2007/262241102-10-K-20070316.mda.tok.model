we operate on a week retail calendar  with each quarter in a week fiscal year representing a week period 
fiscal years and were week fiscal years and fiscal year was a week fiscal year  with the fourth quarter representing a week period 
references in the following discussion to yearly periods are to fiscal years  unless the context indicates otherwise 
the year refers to the fiscal year ended december   refers to the fiscal year ended january   and refers to the fiscal year ended january  highlights 
during the latter half of fiscal year and the first half of fiscal year  we performed a comprehensive strategic review of each of our business segments to evaluate the profitability of each customer order and partnership 
as a result of our analyses  we eliminated or adjusted the price on several thousand over the counter  or otc  skus and reduced our net shipping costs by revising our shipping policies  introducing weight and location based surcharges for certain customer orders  and negotiated lower shipping rates from our primary shipping carrier 
in addition  we terminated our low margin wholesale otc fulfillment agreement with amazon 
com  renegotiated the terms of our agreement with weil lifestyle  llc  or weil  terminated several unprofitable agreements with third party prescription benefit providers  and decided not to participate in the low margin medicare part d prescription drug program 
we also exited an unprofitable 
table of contents relationship with a pharmacy benefits management company  or pbm  in the second half of these profitability initiatives resulted in improved otc gross margins  which increased by basis points  to  and total gross margins  which increased by basis points  to  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended january  these initiatives also positively affected our contribution margin dollars  which increased year over year to million  or  primarily as a result of improved otc contribution margin dollars  which increased year over year by million  or 
although these profitability initiatives resulted in loss of revenue albeit revenue from unprofitable business  we achieved year over year revenue growth of 
this growth occurred primarily in our otc segment  with otc net sales increasing by million  or  and core otc net sales a non gaap measure defined below increasing by million  or  for fiscal year compared to fiscal year business segments  growth strategies 
we operate our business in four business segments otc  mail order pharmacy  local pick up pharmacy  and vision 
over the counter otc 
our otc segment includes all non prescription products sold online through our web stores at www 
drugstore 
com and www 
beauty 
com or over the telephone  including customized nutritional supplements sold through our subsidiary cns 
before december   we recognized all sales of customized vitamins through cns on a gross basis  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates and returns allowances 
on december   we entered into a fulfillment agreement with weil 
under the terms of the new agreement  which replaced our previous agreement with weil  we recognize the revenue associated with the fulfillment of customized vitamins sold through weil on a net basis 
until november   our otc segment also included product revenues and fulfillment fees received under our wholesale otc fulfillment agreement with amazon 
com  inc  under which we acted as a nonexclusive wholesaler and fulfillment provider for certain otc products sold through the health personal care store on the amazon 
com website 
effective november   we terminated this agreement 
the change in the terms of our agreement with weil  which led us to recognize revenue on a net basis for the substantial majority of our cns revenue  and the termination of the amazon 
com wholesale otc agreement make it more difficult to provide a meaningful year over year comparison 
accordingly  in this annual report we refer to our core otc net sales  which is a non gaap measure that excludes from otc net sales wholesale otc net sales of million for the year ended january  and cns net sales of million and million for the years ended december  and january  our management believes that the presentation of core otc net sales and related information provides useful information to the company and its investors  because it excludes specific items that are no longer indicative of our core operating results and facilitates a more meaningful comparison of year over year results of our otc segment 
we source our otc products from various manufacturers and distributors 
we believe that continued growth in this segment will depend on our ability to offer customers a superior shopping experience and service  including providing a broad selection of basic necessity items and hard to find specialty items  which encourages customers to return to our websites and make repeat  replenishment  and impulse purchases 
in  we will continue to focus on improving our customers shopping experience by enhancing our internal search technology and website conversion  expanding our category offerings through the introduction of our drop ship program and making key investments in our prestige beauty 
com website 
mail order pharmacy 
our mail order pharmacy segment includes prescription drugs and supplies  other than prescription contact lenses  sold online through the pharmacy section of the www 
drugstore 
com web store or over the telephone and delivered to customers through our mail order facility 
we procure our prescription inventory through rite aid corporation as part of our ongoing relationship 
we market to both cash paying and insurance covered individuals  and we also serve as a third party provider of mail order prescription fulfillment services for pbms 
we sell over  prescription drugs  including many specialty drugs for the treatment of chronic conditions such as cancer  hiv and multiple sclerosis  which are not carried by brick and mortar pharmacies  and require special handling or service 
in this segment  we focus our marketing efforts directly to consumers online and through doctors to maximize growth in our cash prescription and specialty pharmacy business 
in 
table of contents addition to the sale of prescription drugs  we sell advertising on our website  to monetize the more than one million unique visitors per month researching drugs and other healthcare content provided on the site 
we anticipate that continued growth in this segment in will substantially depend on our ability to grow prescription volumes through these efforts 
we anticipate that our decision not to participate in the low margin medicare part d prescription drug benefit program offered by the us government will continue to have a negative impact on our growth but a favorable impact on our gross margin 
local pick up pharmacy 
our local pick up pharmacy business segment includes prescription refills sold online through the www 
drugstore 
com web store or the www 
riteaid 
com web store which is powered by the www 
drugstore 
com web store or over the telephone and picked up by customers at rite aid stores 
in this segment  rite aid acts as our fulfillment partner 
our success in this segment depends on our ability to leverage our relationship with rite aid through its marketing media  including rite aid store receipts  weekly rite aid advertising circulars and e mail refill reminders 
in  we anticipate that net sales in the local pick up pharmacy segment will not be a significant source of growth  as we continue to focus the majority of our marketing efforts on our otc segment 
vision 
the vision segment includes contact lenses sold through our wholly owned subsidiary international vision direct corp 
and its subsidiaries  collectively referred to as vision direct  through websites located at www 
visiondirect 
com  www 
lensmart 
com and www 
lensquest 
com  or over the telephone at visiondirect 
we purchase our contact lens inventory directly from various manufacturers and other distributors 
in  we are focusing on a strategy of balancing customer acquisition with net margin in order to maximize our profits  rather than focusing exclusively on revenue growth 
revenues 
we generate revenue primarily from product sales and shipping fees 
in  we reported consolidated total net sales of million  which reflected a million  or  increase over our net sales growth was driven by a increase in our total order volume to million orders  partially offset by a decline in our average net sales per order to our net sales benefited from strong year over year growth in our otc segment  which grew by over  and specifically core otc net sales which excludes wholesale and cns net sales  which increased by over in addition  net sales in our local pick up pharmacy and vision segments increased and  respectively  year over year  while net sales in our mail order pharmacy segment decreased by year over year 
expenses 
our operating expenses  including cost of goods sold  decreased as a percentage of net sales to in compared to in the decrease reflects both a favorable shift in our product mix and significant improvement in otc margins due to the success of the profitability initiatives described above 
our marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales as a result of the conclusion of our brand campaign in the first quarter of our general and administrative expenses also decreased year over year as a percentage of net sales in these declines were partially offset by an increase in technology and content expenses as a percentage of net sales  as a result of ongoing enhancements to our it infrastructure 
during the first quarter of  we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement no 
revised  share based payment  or fas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
as a result  stock based compensation expense increased million  or of net sales  during  compared to net loss  cash position 
our net loss for the year ended december  decreased by  or million  to million  compared to million for the year ended january  we ended with million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  compared to million at the end of this balance reflects the use in of million to fund operating activities  million for capital expenditures  and million to repay debt obligations  offset by proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan  and proceeds from debt borrowings of million 

table of contents significant accounting judgments the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the sec defines a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we have identified the significant accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that involve the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results 
we have included additional information about our significant accounting policies in note of our consolidated financial statements included in part iv  item of this annual report 
although we believe that our estimates  assumptions and judgments are reasonable  they are based on information presently available 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
in addition  any significant unanticipated changes in any of our assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of otc other than weil related cns sales  as described below  mail order pharmacy  and vision products are recorded net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
revenue is recognized when the following revenue recognition criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price or fee earned is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we generally require payment by credit card at the point of sale 
return allowances  which reduce product sales by our estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
historically  product returns and differences between our estimates and actual returns have not been significant 
revenues from sales of customized vitamins sold through our fulfillment agreement with weil are recognized when products are shipped and title passes to the customer 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or eitf  we record revenues generated by the weil agreement in our otc segment on a net basis  because we act as an agent  based on the fact that we earn a fixed dollar amount per customer transaction regardless of the amount billed to the customer and we do not bear general inventory risk associated with these sales 
non weil customized vitamin sales are recognized on a gross basis  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
before we entered into the new fulfillment agreement with weil on december   we also recognized weil customized vitamin sales on a gross basis  net of promotional discounts  cancellations  rebates  and returns allowances 
net sales in our otc segment also include consignment service fees earned under our agreement with general nutrition corporation  or gnc  and agreements with other consignment vendors  which are also recorded on a net basis  because we do not take title to the inventory and do not establish pricing 
effective november   we terminated our agreement with amazon 
com 
prior to the termination  we recognized revenues from sales of otc products ordered through the amazon 
com website and fulfilled by drugstore 
com when we shipped the products from our distribution center 
in accordance with eitf  we recorded fulfillment fees and revenues generated by the amazon 
com agreement in our otc segment on a gross basis  because we acted as a principal  based on the fact that we bore general inventory risk associated with these sales 
neither party had any material obligations following termination 
revenues from sales of prescription products ordered online or by telephone through the drugstore 
com web store or the riteaid 
com web store which is powered by the drugstore 
com web store for pick up at a rite aid 
table of contents store  including co payments received and collected on our behalf by rite aid  are recognized when the customer picks up the product 
in these circumstances  we use rite aid as our fulfillment partner 
in accordance with eitf  we record revenues in our local pick up pharmacy segment on a gross basis  because we act as a principal  based on the fact that  among other things  we bear both inventory risk and credit and collection risk associated with these sales 
for insured prescriptions in both our local pick up and mail order segments  the co payment and the insurance reimbursement which together make up the amount due to drugstore 
com constitute the full value of the prescription drug sale  and we receive this entire amount as cash 
we therefore recognize the entire amount as revenue when the order is shipped to the customer for mail order prescriptions or picked up by the customer for local pick up prescriptions 
from time to time  we provide incentive offers to our customers to encourage purchases 
such offers include discounts on specific current purchases  or future rebates based on a percentage of the current purchase  as well as other offers 
discounts  when accepted by our customers  are treated as a reduction to the sales price of the related transaction and are presented as a net amount in net sales 
rebates are treated as a reduction to the sales price based on estimated redemption rates 
redemption rates are estimated using our historical experience for similar offers 
historically  our redemption rates have not differed materially from our estimates  which we adjust quarterly 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost using the weighted average cost method or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust our inventories for shrinkage and slow moving  damaged  and expired inventory  which is recorded as the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on management s assumptions about future demand for the products we offer and market conditions 
we use a variety of methods to reduce the quantity of slow moving inventory  including reducing sales prices on our websites  negotiating returns to vendors  and liquidating inventory through third parties 
if our estimates of future product demand or our assumptions about market conditions are inaccurate  we could understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
historically  inventory reserves have not differed materially from our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangibles  or fas  we test for impairment of goodwill at the beginning of the fourth quarter and whenever indicators of impairment occur 
the first phase of the test screens for impairment 
if impairment is determined  the second phase measures the amount of impairment by comparing the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
fair value is determined using either a discounted cash flow methodology or methodology based on comparable market prices 
we review our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment when indicators of impairment occur and annually at the beginning of the fourth quarter 
we compare the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value and record an impairment charge when the carrying value of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or fas  we review the carrying values of our amortized long lived assets  including definite lived intangible assets  whenever an indicator of impairment occurs 
when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired  we perform an evaluation of recoverability 
the determination of whether impairment exists is based on any excess of the carrying value over the expected future cash flows  as estimated through undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges 
we measure any resulting impairment charge based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value  as estimated through expected future discounted cash flows  discounted at a rate of return for an alternate investment 

table of contents if our estimates of revenue growth or future cash flows prove to be inaccurate  we may have a future impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets  or long lived assets 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognition of compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fas r  recognized over the vesting period of the underlying options using the multiple option approach  b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   which is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r  recognized over the requisite service period of the award on a straight line basis  and c compensation cost for shares issued under the espp  which is based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r and is not considered material to our overall consolidated financial statements 
we calculate the fair value of our stock options granted to employees using the black scholes option pricing model using the single option approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
our computation of expected volatility is based on our historical volatility  adjusted for changes in capital structure and corporate changes  information available that may indicate future volatility  and observable mean reversion tendencies of historical volatility 
our computation of expected life is determined using the simplified method outlined by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab under this method  our expected term is equal to the sum of the weighted average vesting term plus the original contractual term divided by two  which results in a six year expected term 
we base the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
where the expected term of our stock based awards do not correspond with the terms for which interest rates are quoted  we average the periods to determine the rate from the available term maturities 
a dividend yield of is considered appropriate as we have not issued and do not anticipate issuing any dividends in the near future 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historical voluntary termination behavior in addition to analyzing actual option forfeitures 
in conjunction with this analysis  we identified distinct subgroups non management employees  management employees  our chief executive officer  board members  and other non employees 
an estimated forfeiture rate of approximately is applied to non management and management employee subgroups based on the weighted average termination behavior of those subgroups 
a forfeiture rate of is applied to our chief executive officer  board members  and non employees 
prior to the adoption of fas r  we recognized the impact of forfeitures when they occurred 
a change in our estimated forfeiture rate results in a retrospective increase or decrease in stock based compensation in the period of change 
any such revisions to the estimates we use to calculate the fair value of our stock based awards could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
see note of our consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans  included in part iv  item of this annual report 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
periodically  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and legal proceedings and may revise our estimates 
any such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our future results of operations and financial position

our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  salaries  marketing expenses  and overhead and fixed costs 
any projections of our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty for the reasons discussed in this section and in the section entitled risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report

we do not have any future material noncancelable commitments to purchase goods or services 
we believe that our cash and marketable securities on hand plus our sources of cash will be sufficient to fund our operations and anticipated capital expenditures 
however  any projections about our future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
as a result  we may need to raise additional monies to fund our operating activities or for strategic flexibility if  for example  we decide to build a new distribution center or pursue business or technology acquisitions or if our expectations regarding our operations and anticipated capital expenditures change 
we have assessed in the past  and will continue to assess  opportunities for raising additional funds by selling equity  equity related or debt securities  obtaining additional credit facilities or obtaining other means of financing for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms when required  or at all 
furthermore  if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of securities  such securities may have rights  preferences  or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience additional dilution

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we have assessed our vulnerability to certain market risks  including interest rate risk associated with marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  capital lease obligations  and cash and cash equivalents 
due to the short term nature of these investments and our investment policies and procedures  we have determined that the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations related to these financial instruments is not material to us 
we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by maintaining a conservative debt to equity ratio 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
our financing facilities expose our net earnings to changes in short term interest rates because interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
borrowings outstanding under the variable interest bearing financing facilities totaled million at december   and the highest interest rate attributable to this outstanding balance was at december  a change in net earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material 
we have investment risk exposure arising from our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   we had million of securities classified as marketable securities 
we regularly review the carrying value of our investments and identify and record losses when events and circumstances indicate that declines in the fair value of such assets below our accounting basis are other than temporary
