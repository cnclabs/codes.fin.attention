item business general development of business company background and overview 
daktronics  inc was founded by dr 
aelred kurtenbach and dr 
duane sander in while they were professors of electrical engineering at south dakota state university sdsu in brookings  south dakota 
our long and close relationship with sdsu and other south dakota colleges and universities is a key factor contributing to our leadership in the industry 
we have been able to experience sustained growth due in part to the capability of the local universities and colleges to provide an important source of highly educated full time and student employees 
over the years  our products have evolved significantly  from scoreboards and matrix type displays and related software applications  to complex  integrated visual display systems that include full color video  text and graphics displays located on a local or remote network and tied together through sophisticated control systems which entertain and inform 
in the mid nineties  as light emitting diodes led s became available in red  blue and green colors with outdoor brightness  we pioneered the development of full color led video displays capable of replicating trillions of colors thereby producing large format video systems with excellent color  brightness  energy efficiency and lifetime 
due to our foundation of developing scoring and graphics display systems  in which we were already a leader  we were able to add video capabilities so all of a customer s large format display needs could be met in a complete  integrated system 
this has proven to be a key factor in us becoming the dominant company worldwide in large electronic displays 
over the years  we have invested millions of dollars in product development to add complementary products and services  such as production services  sound systems  marketing services  maintenance and support and other revenue generating products for our customers 
business developments 
as a result of our line of led display systems and software applications  we gained significant market share through designing and manufacturing quality products and providing technical expertise and services 
our products are in use throughout the world  as we are the world s leader in all display product categories  according to independent research 
in the sports market  our integrated video and scoring systems have been installed at many professional  collegiate and high schools facilities  particularly in north america and at international sporting events such as the olympic games 
with commercial applications  our video  digital billboard and graphics displays can be seen in major destination sites  such as las vegas and times square  along roadsides in billboard applications  in front of retail establishments and at major stock exchanges across the globe 
in the transportation market  our vanguard displays are in use in numerous jurisdictions across north america  and our customers include many state departments of transportation 
one of our core growth strategies is to enter geographic markets by opening a small sales and service office that provides after sale support to our entire product line  sales of standard products and support on large custom projects 
this network of offices  which totals approximately locations throughout the world  has historically been and is expected to continue to be an important growth strategy 
we occasionally acquire businesses that provide access to new markets or complement our existing products 
in the past five years  we have acquired a number of small companies 
although these acquisitions increased the scope of services and technology that we are able to provide  our primary growth objective is still the increase of sales through organic growth 
financial information about segments our global business is in a single industry segment the design  development  marketing and support of visual display solutions for the sports  commercial and transportation markets 
narrative description of business we are the world s leading supplier of electronic scoreboards  large electronic display systems and related marketing services  digital messaging solutions  software and services for sports  commercial and transportation applications 
our continuing focus is on supporting customers with superior products  integration and services that provide dynamic  reliable and unique visual communication solutions 
we offer a complete line of products  from small indoor and outdoor scoreboards and electronic displays to large multi million dollar video display systems as well as related control  timing and sound systems and related professional services 
we are recognized worldwide as a technical leader with the capabilities to design  market  manufacture  install and service complete integrated systems that display real time data  graphics  animation and video 
we are engaged in a full range of activities marketing and sales  engineering and design  manufacturing and professional services 
each of those activities is described below 
marketing and sales 
our products have been sold throughout the united states and in many other countries through a combination of direct sales personnel and independent resellers 
in the united states and canada  we use primarily a direct sales force for professional sports  colleges and universities  convention centers and smaller sports facilities  including high schools and transportation applications 
in smaller commercial applications  we use a combination of direct sales staff and resellers 
the majority of the products sold by resellers are standard catalog products 
these are typically moderately priced and relatively easy to install 
a limited number of models are built to inventory and available for quick delivery 
we support our resellers through national and regional direct mail advertising  trade journal advertising  trade show exhibitions and our sales force support in the field 
we believe that we can expand market share by expanding both our direct sales force and resellers 
our direct sales force is comprised of a network of offices located throughout the world supporting all customer types in both sales and service 
in addition to supporting resellers as described above  the direct sales staff sells the entire range of our standard products and substantially all of the large video display systems 
our direct sales staff is structured in a way to maximize cross selling opportunities across markets 
prior to the start of fiscal year  we accomplished this primarily through a matrix structure where the main focus and reporting responsibilities fell into one of our three main markets 
a complementary emphasis was then placed on a regional structure to create opportunities in other markets and to support efforts for the organization as a whole 
beginning in fiscal year  we reorganized our business into five business units which tend to add more focus on the market  while maintaining some of the synergies that existed in the prior structure 
the business units consist of commercial  live events  schools and theaters  transportation and international 
we believe that customers in each area are unique in a number of ways which are conducive to this structure 
for example  live events customers usually have a large variety of product tied into a system in a single location that involves much more creative production services and design 
the commercial business unit relies more on needs created by large and remote networks of displays connected through various modes of communication 
the transportation business unit focuses on the unique needs of governmental contractors and ties into integrated systems of traffic or people management 
finally  the schools and theaters business unit focuses on the increasing level of support and service and limited resources along with all the statistics and related software and communication needs of athletic conferences and leagues 
when we target a potential customer for sales opportunities  the prospect is contacted either directly or through a reseller 
frequently  on larger sales opportunities  engineers  technicians and sales personnel jointly participate in site visits to assess site conditions  evaluate the customer s requirements and assemble and present proposals 
proposals to prospective customers include business and technical presentations as well as product demonstrations and visits to existing installations 
we also regularly host customers at our various manufacturing facilities to demonstrate product quality and delivery capability 
international sales fluctuate from year to year based on the timing of large system projects 
a typical term of sale for international projects includes a letter of credit or partial payment in advance 
we believe that in addition to the growth we expect domestically  we will also achieve growth in the international markets 
during fiscal years  and  approximately  and of our net sales  respectively  were derived from international sales 
since  we have acquired or opened international office locations in canada  china  france  the united arab emirates  germany and the united kingdom 
we also are a owner in a joint venture in malaysia 
much of our marketing and sales success in the past was based on our ability to create new products and product enhancements for customers by understanding their needs and opportunities 
we have developed and continue to develop this understanding through active participation in the sales cycle by engineers and various other personnel  and through attendance at trade shows  conventions and seminars and fostering a culture of teamwork throughout the organization 
engineering and product development 
the large screen electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product innovations and developments in technology and complementary services 
to remain competitive  we must continue to anticipate and respond to changes and developments in the industry 
we will continue our tradition of applying engineering resources throughout our business to help achieve more effective product development by investing approximately of our net sales into product design and development 
we employ engineers and technicians in the areas of mechanical and electrical design  applications engineering  software design and customer and product support 
we use primarily in house engineering to anticipate and respond rapidly to the product development needs of customers and the marketplace 
we assign product managers from our engineering staff to each product or product family to assist our sales staff in training  implement product improvements and ensure that each product is designed for maximum reliability and serviceability 
we also invest in new creative technologies and in companies developing new technologies 
our engineering staff consists of four product development groups sports  video  commercial and transportation 
beginning in fiscal year  these product development groups became more closely aligned with the five business units described above 
the sports product development group focus is aligned with the sports and theater business unit  the video group is focused on live events and international and the commercial and transportation group is more closely aligned with the commercial transportation business units 
until fiscal year  each engineering group was autonomous to allow it to focus on one product family  although the engineering groups also were closely tied with each other to facilitate sharing ideas and technology 
this organizational structure positioned us for effective product development because of our concentrated focus on standardization  which reduces the amount of engineering time allocated to one time custom design 
beginning in fiscal year  with the focus on aligning each engineering group more closely with a business unit  we believe that we can still maintain the tie between the engineering groups and at the same time generate a stronger focus on customers needs which are unique to that business unit 
manufacturing and technical contracting 
as a vertically integrated manufacturer of display systems  we perform most sub assembly and substantially all final assembly of our products 
we also serve as a technical contractor for customers who desire custom hardware design  installation or other technical services 
our manufacturing operations include component manufacturing and system manufacturing metal fabrication  electronic assembly  sub assembly and final assembly 
we augment our production capacity with the use of outside resources primarily due to capacity constraints  although we have also used outside providers when it was more cost effective 
we use a modular approach for manufacturing displays 
standard product modules are designed to be used in a variety of different products 
this modular approach reduces parts inventory and improves manufacturing efficiency 
we inventory a limited supply of standard products 
custom projects are built according to the customer s specifications 
product modules are designed so that a custom product may include a significant percentage of standard components to maximize reliability and ease of service 
we are also taking additional action to decrease the number of projects that are considered custom in terms of the equipment  such as products sold to the billboard niche and increasing overall standardization within video products 
in scheduling and manufacturing  production employees work to ensure quality and timely delivery while minimizing inventories 
our order entry  production  customer service and many other functions are also consolidated through an enterprise resource planning system to facilitate communication among employee teams throughout the entire sales  design  production and delivery process 
during fiscal year  we began significant expansion of our facilities and throughput to respond to the increasing customer demands for our products 
prior to that time  substantially all of our products were manufactured in our main facility in brookings  south dakota 
during fiscal year  we expanded our production facilities in brookings and brought into service manufacturing capabilities in sioux falls  south dakota and redwood falls  minnesota 
we also deployed a limited amount of manufacturing in china 
it is expected that for the long term  the majority of our manufacturing will continue to be in brookings  although other locations now produce a material amount of our products 
during fiscal year we began reorganizing our plants to more closely align them with the five business units described above 
this resulted in significant investment in replicating processes which in prior years were centralized 
this was extremely important given the rapid growth of the business and the resulting unique needs of our customers in each business unit 
our goal was to align sales  marketing  engineering and manufacturing into a cohesive business unit with a focus on customers while not giving up the synergies of shared resources 
technical contracting 
we serve as a technical contractor for larger display system installations that require custom designs and innovative product solutions 
the purchase of scoreboards and other state of the art display systems for large installations typically involves competitive proposals 
as a part of our response to a proposal request  we may suggest additional products or features to assist the prospective customer in analyzing the optimal type of display system 
if requested by a customer or if necessary to help secure a bid  we will include as a part of our proposal the work necessary to prepare the site and install the display system 
in such cases  we may serve as the general contractor and retain subcontractors 
we are licensed in a number of domestic jurisdictions as a general contractor 
professional services 
our professional services are essential to continued market penetration and growth 
to enhance the level of service available to our customers  we provide maintenance and support services and technical contracting in all of our offices throughout the world 
we plan to open other offices in the future to supplement our service capabilities 
in addition  we use a network of authorized service companies to service and maintain our products 
professional services we provide in addition to technical contracting include event support  content creation  product maintenance  marketing assistance and display rentals 
our creative production staff provides a variety of services to customers  including video content  event support  control room design  on site training hardware and software and continuing technical support for operators of complicated display systems 
our daktronics sports marketing division provides customers with a complete display system  funded in part through value added marketing services 
these marketing services extend beyond the marketing potential of the equipment in the facility to other facility related components 
typically  these services are limited to facilities that do not have in house marketing programs and staff 
customer service and support 
our prompt and reliable customer service distinguishes us from our competitors 
this service includes limited warranties for most of our products against failure due to defective parts or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to five years after the first sale or installation  depending on the product or type of customer 
we also provide help desk access  parts repair and replacement and programming support for video  animation and other displays 
we staff our help desk with experienced technicians who are available on call hours a day to support events and sites 
our repair center is staffed with trained technicians who promptly repair and return components that require service and we offer a component exchange program for same day shipment of replacement parts 
our modular approach to the design and production of products enhances our ability to provide effective customer service and support 
customers can attend our training and maintenance seminars held throughout the world  including at our headquarters and can also contract for on site training and maintenance 
beginning in fiscal year  we began deploying professional and hardware support service personnel in each of our business units so that  like other areas described above  the business unit could better focus on the unique needs of its customers 
we maintain a central staff to help coordinate and maximize the synergies between the service groups 
general description of our products and technologies our display technologies have changed significantly since the mid s when incandescent lamps were the primary display element 
presently  led and liquid crystal display lcd technologies are the primary display elements 
the invention and availability of the blue and green led in the mid s  along with the already available red led  allowed the introduction of full color video displays using leds as the primary colors to form all other colors in the video display 
the decreasing costs of lcd components along with the drive for more numerous smaller displays have led to the addition of lcd displays 
finally  driven by customer demand  we have enhanced our video display technology into mobile and modular technologies and high definition capabilities for various applications 
we offer primarily led products across our entire product line 
the cost  performance and availability of various leds has made them the preferred display element for large displays as compared to alternatives such as incandescent and reflective technologies  most of which are obsolete or unproven 
the cost effectiveness  life and performance of lcds have made them the preferred indoor small display solution 
the vast majority of displays we sell today utilize led technology 
the two principal components of many of our systems are the display and the display controller 
the display controller uses computer hardware and software to process the information provided by the operator and other integrated sources and then compiles the information  graphics or animation to be presented on the display 
data can be transferred between the display controller and local or remote displays 
local connections may use wire cables  fiber optic cables  infrared links or radio links 
standard and cellular telephone connections and satellite transmissions are used to connect to remote displays 
the display controller controls each of the pixels which are the dots or picture elements that make up the image on the display to present the message or image 
most of our display technologies rely on one or more of our software products to manage and provide content for the display 
these software products range in complexity from scoring consoles  to the venus display control software that allows the creation  display and scheduling of dynamic text and basic graphics content on electronic displays and to the venus display control system that controls multi color displays and video boards  providing the ability to create graphics and animation as well as interfacing with third party software for content 
additionally  our visiconn sm control software is used to display targeted messages to specific audiences and to control large networks of digital displays 
complementary software  such as our dakstats and interfacing software  is also available and can be fully integrated into the control software 
our display systems range from small scoreboards and digit displays priced at under  to large complex display systems priced in excess of million 
generally  our product sales are either custom products or standard catalog scoreboards or displays 
historically  these standard catalog sales have accounted for approximately of our total annual revenues 
our custom products are customized in terms of size  configuration and installation type but are generally built using standard technology platforms 
within each product family  we produce both standard and custom displays that vary in complexity  size and resolution 
the physical dimensions of a display depend on the size of the viewing area  the distance from the viewer to the display and the amount and type of information to be displayed 
generally  the light source  or pixels  are spaced farther apart for longer distance viewing 
the type of the display may also depend on the location of the viewing audience 
for example  arena scoreboards may have a viewing angle nearly as wide as degrees  compared with roadside displays  which typically are viewed from a passing vehicle only within a narrow angle from the display 
we customize our products according to the design specifications of the customer and the conditions of the environment and setting 
product families and technologies our products are comprised of the following four major product families sport and theater products  primarily all sport  tuff sport and omnisport scoreboards  vortek hoists and related controllers and timing systems  video products  primarily prostar  protour  and proad displays  and associated control systems  commercial products  primarily galaxy displays and venus control systems  and transportation products  primarily vanguard displays 
each of these product families is discussed below 
sport and theater products 
the sport and theater products family includes a full line of indoor and outdoor scoreboards  timing systems  digit displays  sound systems  statistics software  hoist systems and other related products 
the indoor products range in complexity from two digit shot clocks and small scoreboards to large  center hung scoreboards incorporating message centers  advertising panels and hoist systems 
outdoor scoreboards range in complexity from two digit game timers and small scoreboards to large scoring systems incorporating message centers and advertising panels 
the sizes of displays can vary significantly depending on the needs of the customer  taking into account such things as viewing angles and spectator distances 
we expect that sport and theater products sales in the future will continue to focus on the use of led technology due to its lower power consumption  longer life and resulting lower maintenance costs as compared to other technologies 
because most of the products within the sport and theater products group have significant standardization  we have been able to make progress on our goal of delivering the highest quality products while maintaining consistent margins 
we offer a variety of internally developed controllers complementing our scoreboards and displays  which vary depending on the type of sport and complexity of the system 
these controllers vary in price and complexity from the all sport  which is a controller for portable scoreboards  to the all sport  which is designed for more sophisticated scoring systems  allowing for more user defined options 
these controllers can be interfaced with the scoreboards through radio frequencies  fiber optic connections or other means 
we also offer timing systems for sports events  primarily aquatics and track competitions 
these timing systems include our omnisport timing system 
the system has the capability to not only time and rank the competitors  but also to interface to event management software created by other third parties to facilitate the administration of the sporting event 
as a key component of an integrated system  we market sports statistics and results software under the dakstats trademark 
the software allows entry and display of sports statistics and other information displays 
it is the leading application of its type in professional  collegiate and high school baseball and other sports 
vortek automated rigging systems complement our arena center hung scoreboard display systems for both small and large sporting facilities 
additionally  the vortek hoist provides automated rigging for theater applications  primarily smaller theaters  such as in high schools and similar venues 
the strengths of the vortek automated rigging systems include safety and ease of operation 
video products 
the video products family consists primarily of displays  which are comprised of a large number of pixels capable of creating various levels of video  graphics and animation and controllers  which manage the operation of the display 
video display products are based on red  green and blue leds arranged in various combinations to form pixels or picture elements 
the electronic circuitry which controls the pixels allows for variances in the relative brightness of each led to provide a full color spectrum  thereby displaying video images in striking  vibrant colors 
we offer a wide range of video display products for different applications and budgets 
variables in typical video displays include the spacing of the pixels pixel pitch the brightness of the displays  the number of discrete colors that the display is able to produce color resolution and the viewing angle 
in addition  modular design allows the product to be readily configured in custom sizes to meet each customer s specific requirements  with no maximum to the size of display that can be built 
in general  the more pixels and the more color resolution  the better the video image on the display 
our prostar video display systems offer specifications second to none in the industry 
at the high end  the product is capable of producing trillion colors and is available with pixel spacing as close as three millimeters 
currently  we offer a wide range of pixel spacing  ranging from three millimeter to millimeter 
the three millimeter application provides the user with the greatest pixel density and shortest viewing distance  spacing and the millimeter is the most cost effective for physically large displays with maximum viewing distances 
in addition  the uniformity of colors across the display is important to the quality of the video image 
our unique display control circuitry along with our proprietary manufacturing and calibration procedures provide uniform colors across the display 
we have adapted our prostar technology into our proad digital advertising and information display system  the protour modular display system  the prorail display systems and our propixel tm display systems 
proad technology uses red  green and blue led modules configured in different height to width ratios to give arena and stadium facilities the ability to install long  narrower bands of displays in various locations in the facility 
this application generally serves as a revenue generation source for facilities through advertising as well as a location to display information such as scoring  statistics and video 
protour display systems are comprised of lightweight individual modules or panels less than a square meter in size that are assembled together to form a display in a customizable height and width 
these panels are focused in what we refer to as the mobile and modular application  such as touring shows and the events market 
prorail display systems incorporate our proad displays into a patented cabinet designed to serve as a replacement for the fascia of an upper deck in a stadium or arena  which in some cases improves the sight lines of the fans 
propixel displays serve as architectural accents and channel lettering 
our main controller for these video displays is our venus controller  which is built on the windows operating system 
this high end controller provides advanced capability for controlling large video displays 
the v play event management software provides facilities with integrated and sophisticated event program management capabilities with integration to video equipment 
it provides instant replays  live action and overlays of information and it allows for the organization and playback of digital video and audio clips 
other video products controllers include the visiconn sm  v tour and v show controllers 
each of these controllers is designed with unique features and functionality for unique market niches 
our v tour design interfaces between our display systems and other systems allowing  for example  scoreboard and video systems to receive and display information from computers used for statistics  timing or scoring 
these interfaces allow the display controller to send information back to a statistics system or customer computer and can automatically report continually updated sports scores and information from national wire services 
commercial products 
the key product lines in the commercial products family are our galaxy and galaxypro product lines  which include various indoor and outdoor applications intended primarily as graphics and text based displays 
all of the current product offerings within the commercial products group use led technologies 
galaxy displays  available in both indoor and outdoor models  are our leading product line for commercial applications and are expected to be a key product line for growth in the future 
galaxy displays are red  amber or full color  with pixel spacing ranging from millimeter to millimeter depending on size and viewing distance 
they are used primarily as message centers to convey information and advertising to the consumers and the public 
this product line has become one of our fastest growing product lines 
the modular design of the product allows us to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
within the galaxy line  we offer various price points for similar sized displays of the same pixel spacing 
galaxypro displays are full matrix outdoor displays capable of displaying pre recorded video  text  graphics and animation 
galaxypro displays are offered in full color with pixel spacing from millimeter to millimeter 
galaxypro displays are capable of producing billion colors  have excellent color uniformity across the display and are fully compatible with our venus display control software 
the modular design of the product allows us to configure a display to readily meet the size requirements of each customer 
other product lines within the commercial products group include our datatime  datamaster  datatrac  dakticker and infonet displays 
the datatime product line consists of outdoor time and temperature displays in various character sizes 
the datatime displays feature a programmable time and temperature display and use a remote sensor for temperature data input 
the datamaster product line consists of outdoor rate  gas price  generic counting timing and lottery displays in various character sizes 
the datatime products are offered in red or amber while the datamaster products are offered in red  amber and green 
the datamaster product line is one of our fastest growing product lines and has very high growth potential in the petroleum market niche 
the datatrac product lines consist of indoor led displays comprised of discrete characters 
each character is spaced evenly horizontally and vertically from the adjacent character 
this provides the least expensive display per character for the display of text messages only 
dakticker displays are used primarily in financial institutions for ticker displays and to display other financial information 
the infonet product line includes line oriented displays for indoor use that are available as single or multi line units 
all datatrac  dakticker and infonet products have a controller in the display that is capable of receiving a downloaded display program and then operating independently to display that program until a new program is downloaded to it 
the majority of our commercial products group s products utilize our proprietary venus display control software to control the creation of messages and graphic sequences for downloading to the display 
this software is designed to be useable without any special training and it is applicable to all general advertising or message presentation applications 
we also provide software that allows oem customers system integrators to write their own software using the venus software developer s kit to communicate to displays supplied by us 
several system integrators have implemented the venus protocol into their specific applications  resulting in additional display sales 
transportation products 
the transportation products family includes a wide range of led based products for road management  parking  mass transit and aviation applications 
the vanguard family of electronic displays  which lead transportation product sales  are typically used to direct traffic and inform motorists 
the vanguard line includes both permanently mounted and portable displays 
we have also developed a software control system for these displays to help transportation agencies manage large networks of displays 
our digit and directional displays are primarily marketed under the datamaster name and sold for use in parking facilities 
several of the transportation products are also routinely sold into our commercial and sports markets 
most of the transportation products are designed and tested to rigorous transportation industry standards 
our personnel routinely work with standards development organizations to assist in writing standards that benefit the public and take advantage of the latest display technologies 
sources of raw materials we source some of our raw materials  including leds  from a limited number of suppliers 
we do so because of the high level of quality we require 
the loss of any single supplier  however  would not have a material effect on us 
in addition  to reduce our inventories and enhance product quality  we limit our suppliers to those who are willing to provide components on an as needed basis 
from time to time  we enter into pricing agreements or purchasing contracts under which we agree to purchase a minimum amount of product in exchange for guaranteed price terms over the length of the contract  which generally does not exceed one year 
intellectual property we develop patentable technology on a continuing basis 
we hold a number of us and foreign patents and have a number of patent applications pending 
the patents pertain primarily to our display technologies and product features 
we rely on trademarks  in addition to patents  to help establish and preserve limited proprietary protection for our products 
our trademarks are registered in the united states and several other countries 
we also have numerous trademark applications pending 
these trademarks are used to establish brand recognition and distinction in our various markets 
product drawings  software and other works of authorship are also subject to applicable copyright law protections 
we provide software to our customers in object code to help preserve our intellectual rights 
we also rely on nondisclosure and license agreements with our employees 
despite these intellectual property protections  there can be no assurance that a competitor will not copy the functions or features of our products 
seasonal nature of the business our sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for facilities where professional and major college sports events take place and large commercial systems and networks 
the seasonality of the sports market has also played a part in our sales and profit fluctuations 
as a result  sales and net income in the first and second quarters of a fiscal year tend to be higher than in the third quarter of that fiscal year  followed by higher levels in the fourth quarter  leading into the first quarter of the following year 
this seasonality is caused by sales related to facilities for football and other fall sports in the summer and early fall  followed by sales generally related to facilities for basketball and hockey in the fall and finally facilities for baseball and other spring and summer sports in the early to late spring 
this seasonal effect is generally compounded by large product orders in the sports markets and by the effects of holidays during the third quarter 
the effects of seasonality not related to holidays are generally not found in our commercial and transportation markets  although the impact of large orders in those markets can cause significant fluctuations in sales and profits 
we believe that with the mix of business favoring more emphasis on outdoor advertising applications  we could see more seasonality in the commercial business unit in the future  with sales slowing in our winter months 
approximately of our orders are in the sports markets  percent are in the commercial market and the remaining approximately are in transportation 
gross margins on large orders tend to fluctuate more than the gross margins on smaller  standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins with greater variability in margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for these larger orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations will be subject to similar fluctuations 
working capital items on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
customers the primary markets we serve  along with types of customers  are as follows markets types of customers large sports venues large colleges and universities  professional sports teams and facilities  olympic games  national and international sports federations  civic arenas and convention centers and motor racing 
schools and theaters elementary and secondary schools  small colleges and universities  local recreation centers and theaters  primarily high school 
commercial retailers  outdoor advertisers  hospitality providers  quick serve restaurants  financial institutions  casinos  pari mutuel racing and other similar businesses 
transportation state and local departments of transportation  airlines  airports and related industries  parking facilities and transit authorities 
we have a large and diverse customer base 
as a result  the loss of a major customer would not have an adverse impact on us 
one customer accounted for approximately of our revenue in fiscal year backlog our backlog consists of customer sales agreements or purchase orders that we expect to fill within the next months and was approximately million as of april  and million as of april  because sales agreements and purchase orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by customers with a limited or no penalty  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future net sales or net income 
although orders for many of our products may be shipped within days  other orders may take longer depending on the customer s project schedule or other factors 
government and other regulation in the united states and other countries  various laws and regulations  including zoning ordinances  restrict the installation of outdoor signs and displays  particularly in the commercial market 
these laws and regulations include those that impose greater restrictions on electronic displays due to alleged concerns over aesthetics or driver safety if a display is located near a road or highway 
these factors may prevent or inhibit us from selling products to some prospective customers 
some of our products are tested to safety standards developed by underwriters laboratories in the united states  as well as similar standards in other countries 
we design and produce our products in accordance with these standards 
our printed circuit board manufacturing operations use certain chemical processes that are subject to various environmental rules and regulations 
our manufacturing operations must also meet various safety related rules and regulations 
we believe we are in compliance with all applicable governmental laws and regulations 
in some countries we operate in  including primarily china  there are various laws and regulations that restrict or limit our ability to withdraw our capital investment 
competition the large electronic display industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition from a variety of sources 
there are a number of established manufacturers of competing products who may have greater market penetration in certain market niches or greater financial  marketing and other resources 
competitors might also attempt to copy our products or product features 
because a customer s budget for the purchase of a large screen electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  we may also compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
many of our competitors compete in only one or a few of the market niches or product categories we serve 
there are generally more competitors in markets that require less complicated display systems  such as the high school scoreboard market and the text and graphics display markets  including displays in banks and small retail stores 
as the needs of customers increase and the display systems become more complex  there are generally fewer competitors 
however  due to the high profile nature of larger complex display systems  the competition may be more intense 
over the past five years  we have experienced significant changes in our competitive landscape and expect that more changes could occur in the future 
these changes included consolidation of competitors  unsustainable pricing pressures from competitors and various other factors 
although these changes have an impact on the market as a whole  we are confident that we can continue to grow and expand our business because of our experience and approach to the market 
we compete based on our broad range of products and features  complementary services  advanced technology  prompt delivery and reliable and readily available customer service and support 
we also strive to provide cost effective products and solutions for our customers 
contrary to our focus on technologically advanced products and customer support  some of our competitors compete in some markets by providing lower cost display systems  which are of a lesser quality with lower product performance or less customer support 
if a customer focuses principally on price  we are less likely to obtain the sale 
to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance our existing products  introduce new products and product features and provide customers with cost effective solutions to their display needs 
research and development we believe our engineering capability and experience are unparalleled among our competitors and that our product development capability will continue to be a very important factor in our market position 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
environmental concerns we believe that we do not have any environmental issues that would materially affect capital expenditures  earnings or our competitive position in the marketplace 
employees as of april   we employed approximately  full time employees and approximately part time and temporary employees 
of these employees  approximately  were in manufacturing   were in sales  marketing and customer service  were in engineering and were in administration 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe employee relations are good

item a 
risk factors a number of risks and uncertainties exist which could impact our future operating results 
these uncertainties include  but are not limited to  general economic conditions  competition  our success in developing new products and technologies  market acceptance of new products and other factors  including those set forth below 
competition could result in lower sales and decreased margins 
we operate in highly competitive markets that  in certain portions of the business  are highly fragmented 
in addition  because a customer s budget for the purchase of an electronic display is often part of that customer s advertising budget  our products often compete with other forms of advertising  such as television  print media or fixed display signs 
competition could result in not only a reduction in net sales but also in the prices charged by us for our products 
to remain competitive  we must be able to not only anticipate and respond quickly to our customers needs and enhance and upgrade our existing products and services to meet those needs but also continue to price our products competitively 
our competitors may develop cheaper  more efficient products or may be willing to charge lower prices for strategic marketing or to increase market share 
some competitors have more capital and other resources than we do and may be better able to take advantage of acquisition opportunities or adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements 
our business may suffer if we are not successful in our efforts to keep up with a rapidly changing product market 
the electronic display industry is characterized by ongoing product improvement  innovations and developments in display and controller technology 
competitors could develop new or superior products to increase their share of the markets 
our future success in addressing the needs of our customers will depend in part on our ability to continue to make timely and cost effective product improvements  innovations and developments 
we enter into fixed priced contracts on a regular basis 
if our actual costs exceed original estimates on fixed price contracts  our profits will be reduced 
the majority of contracts we enter into are on a fixed price basis 
although we benefit from cost savings  we have a limited ability to recover cost overruns 
because of the large scale and long duration of some contracts  unanticipated cost increases may occur as a result of several factors including  but not limited to  increases in the cost or shortages of components  materials or labor  unanticipated technical problems  required project modifications not initiated by the customer  and suppliers or subcontractors failure to perform or a delay in performing their obligations 
these factors could delay delivery of products and contracts may provide for liquidated damages for late delivery 
unanticipated costs that cannot be passed on to customers or the payment of liquidated damages under fixed contracts would negatively impact our profits 
backlog may not be indicative of future revenue 
customers may cancel or delay projects for reasons beyond our control 
orders normally contain cancellation provisions that permit the recovery of costs expended and a portion of the anticipated profit if a customer cancels an order 
if a customer elects to cancel  we may not realize the full amount of revenues included in our backlog 
if projects are delayed  the timing of revenues could be affected and projects may remain in the backlog for extended periods of time 
revenue recognition occurs over longer periods of time and is subject to unanticipated delays 
if we receive relatively large orders in any given quarter  fluctuations in the levels of the quarterly backlog can result because the backlog in that quarter may reach levels that may not be sustained in subsequent quarters 
for these reasons  backlog may not be indicative of future revenues 
our ability to conduct business outside the united states may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control which could adversely affect net sales and profits from international sales 
for fiscal year  revenue outside the united states represented approximately of our consolidated net sales 
our operations and earnings throughout the world have been and may in the future be  affected from time to time in varying degrees by war  political developments  foreign laws and regulations  regional economic uncertainty  political instability  restrictions  customs and tariffs  changing regulatory environments  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and adverse tax consequences 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their overall effect on us vary greatly from country to country and are not predictable 
these factors may result in a decline in net sales or profitability and could adversely affect our ability to expand our business outside of the united states 
our financial performance may vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making it difficult to estimate future revenue 
our quarterly revenues and earnings have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
contracts we enter into generally stipulate customer specific delivery terms and may have contract cycles of a year or more  which subjects them to many factors beyond our control 
furthermore  because significant portions of our operating costs are fixed  an unanticipated delay or cancellation of orders in backlog may have a significant negative impact on our quarterly operating results 
therefore  quarterly operating results may be subject to significant variations and operating performance in one quarter may not be indicative of future performance 
our products are covered by warranties 
unanticipated warranty and other costs for defective products could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reputation 
we provide warranties on our products generally for terms of five years or less in the case of standard products and one year or less in the case of custom orders 
in addition  in response to customer needs  we regularly offer extended warranties 
these warranties require us to repair or replace faulty products and meet certain performance standards  among other customary warranty provisions 
although we continually monitor our warranty claims and provide a reserve for estimated warranty issues on an on going basis  an unanticipated claim could have a material adverse impact on operations 
in some cases  we may be able to subrogate a claim back to a subcontractor or supplier if the subcontractor or supplier supplied the defective product or performed the service  but this may not always be possible 
the need to repair or replace products with design or manufacturing defects could temporarily delay the sale of new products  reduce profits and adversely affect our reputation 
product liability claims not covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to product liability claims involving claims of personal injury or property damage 
although we maintain product liability insurance coverage to protect us in the event of such a claim  our coverage may not be adequate to cover the cost of defense and the potential award 
also  a well publicized actual or perceived problem could adversely affect our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
large contracts with significant customers represent a significant portion of our accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings 
we closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and have not  to date  experienced significant credit losses 
significant portions of our sales are to customers who place large orders for custom products 
we mitigate our exposure to credit risk  to some extent  by requiring deposits  payments prior to shipment  progress payments and letters of credit 
however  because some of the exposure is outside of our control  unanticipated events could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts and the size and timing of large contracts 
the amounts of our orders and net sales and our financial results will be substantially affected by whether we are awarded large contracts  primarily in the professional and major college facilities market and the outdoor advertising niche  and the amounts and timing of these contracts 
whether we are awarded large contracts and their timing and amount could also cause material fluctuations in our net sales and earnings 
awards of large contracts and their timing and amount are difficult to predict and are outside of our control 
the terms and conditions of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations and we may not be able to raise additional capital  if needed 
the terms and conditions of our million revolving credit facility impose restrictions that limit  among other things  our ability to incur debt  merge  sell assets  make distributions and create or incur liens 
the availability of the credit facility is also subject to certain covenants as explained later in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to comply with the covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and we cannot assure that we will achieve operating results meeting the requirements of the credit facility 
a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the bank could elect to declare any outstanding principal amount of the credit facility and term debt  any and all accrued interest thereon and any and all other amounts payable under the credit facility  to be immediately due and payable 
as of april   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants of our credit facility 
our ability to satisfy any debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
it is anticipated that borrowings from the existing credit facility and cash provided by operating activities should provide sufficient funds to finance capital expenditures  working capital and otherwise meet operating expenses and debt service requirements as they become due 
however  if additional capital is required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our business is partially subject to risks of terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war 
terrorist acts and  to a lesser degree  acts of war may disrupt our operations as well as the operations of our customers 
such acts have created an interruption of orders and delays in orders already booked primarily in sports facilities and destination sites 
any future terrorist activities and  to a lesser degree  acts of war  could create additional uncertainties forcing customers to further reduce or delay their spending or cancel or delay already planned projects  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our common stock has at times been thinly traded  which may result in low liquidity and price volatility 
the daily trading volume of our common stock has at times been relatively low 
if this were to occur in the future  the liquidity and appreciation of our common stock may not meet shareholders expectations and the prices at which it trades may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted as a result of sales by existing shareholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or by the perception that such sales could occur 
we may fail to continue to attract  develop and retain key management and other key employees  including technical engineering talent  which could negatively impact our operating results 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team and other key employees 
the loss of certain members of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  could negatively impact our operating results and ability to execute our business strategy 
our future success will also depend in part upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
we do not have employment agreements with the executive officers or other employees  but we do maintain key person life insurance on the lives of our chairman of the board and our chief executive officer 
provisions in our charter documents and under south dakota law and our shareholder rights agreement might deter acquisition bids for us 
there are provisions in our charter and other provisions under south dakota law that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation provide for a classified board consisting of three classes of directors 
a classified board generally makes it more difficult to replace directors and to acquire our company 
in addition  we are governed by the provisions of the current south dakota business corporation act sd act  which may deny shareholders the receipt of a premium on their common stock  which in turn have a depressive effect on the market price of the common stock 
in general  shares of a corporation acquired in a control share acquisition  as defined in the sd act  have no rights unless voting rights are approved in a prescribed manner 
there are also provisions that prohibit a public south dakota corporation from engaging in a business combination  as defined in the sd act  with an interested shareholder  as defined in the sd act  for a period of four years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested shareholder unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
in addition  we have adopted a shareholder rights agreement designed to protect against unsolicited attempts to acquire our company 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights 
we rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our products and services 
we may not be able to successfully preserve these intellectual property rights in the future and these rights could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries in which our products and services have been or may be sold do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
a failure to protect proprietary information and any successful intellectual property challenges or infringement proceedings against us could materially and adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  even if we are successful in protecting our intellectual property rights or defending ourselves against a claim of infringement  any related dispute or litigation could be costly and time consuming 
we maintain inventory that is subject to obsolescence and write downs to the extent it is replaced through product enhancements or advances in technology 
as a result of our products being subject to continuous enhancements and design changes  inventory held by us is subject to the risk of obsolescence and excess levels that may not be saleable 
losses incurred as a result could have a material impact on our future profits

item legal proceedings we are involved in a variety of legal actions relating to various legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
although we are unable to predict the ultimate outcome of these legal actions  it is the opinion of management that the disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements taken as a whole

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a wide range of display systems to customers in a variety of markets throughout the world 
we focus our sales and marketing efforts on geographical regions  markets and products 
the primary categories of markets are the sports  commercial and transportation markets 
our net sales and profitability historically have fluctuated due to the impact of large product orders  such as display systems for professional sport facilities and colleges and universities  as well as the seasonality of the sports market 
net sales and gross profit percentages also have fluctuated due to other seasonality factors including the impact of holidays  which primarily impact our third quarter 
our gross margins on large product orders tend to fluctuate more than those for smaller standard orders 
large product orders that involve competitive bidding and substantial subcontract work for product installation generally have lower gross margins 
although we follow the percentage of completion method of recognizing revenues for large custom orders  we nevertheless have experienced fluctuations in operating results and expect that our future results of operations may be subject to similar fluctuations 
orders are booked only upon receipt of a firm contract and  depending on terms  only after receipt of any required deposits related to the order 
as a result  certain orders for which we have received binding letters of intent or contracts will not be booked until all required contractual documents and deposits are received 
in addition  order bookings can vary significantly as a result of the timing of large orders 
we operate on a to week fiscal year  with fiscal years ending on the saturday closest to april of each year 
fiscal years  and each contained weeks 
for a summary of recently issued accounting pronouncements and the effects of those pronouncements on our financial results  refer to note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements or the section of this item entitled recent accounting pronouncements  which are included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to estimated total costs on long term contracts  estimated costs to be incurred for product warranties and extended maintenance contracts  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  stock based compensation and contingencies 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term contracts 
earnings on long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs for each contract 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are capable of being estimated 
generally  contracts we enter into have fixed prices established and to the extent the actual costs to complete contracts are higher than the amounts estimated as of the date of the financial statements  the resulting gross margin would be negatively affected in future quarters when we revise our estimates 
our practice is to revise estimates as soon as such changes in estimates are known 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in future estimates or assumptions we use to determine these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to identify impairment in the customer s ability to pay  we review aging reports  contact customers in connection with collection efforts and review other available information 
although we consider our allowance for doubtful accounts adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances may be required in future periods 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of april  and april   we had an allowance for doubtful accounts balance of million and million  respectively 
warranties 
we have created a reserve for warranties on our products equal to our estimate of the actual costs to be incurred in connection with our performance under the warranties 
generally  estimates are based on historical experience taking into account known or expected changes 
if we would become aware of an increase in our warranty reserves  additional reserves may become necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine our reserve for warranties 
as of april  and april   we had million and million reserved for warranty costs  respectively 
extended warranty and product maintenance 
we have deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance agreements 
the deferred revenue is recognized ratably over the contractual term 
if we would become aware of an increase in our estimated costs under these agreements in excess of our deferred revenue  additional reserves may be necessary  resulting in an increase in costs of goods sold 
in determining if additional reserves are necessary  we examine cost trends on the contracts and other information and compare that to the deferred revenue 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine estimated costs under these agreements 
as of april  and april   we had million and million of deferred revenue related to separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance  respectively 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
market refers to the current replacement cost  except that market may not exceed the net realizable value that is  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonable predictable costs of completion and disposal and market is not less than the net realizable value reduced by an allowance for normal profit margins 
in valuing inventory  we estimate market value where it is believed to be the lower of cost or market and any necessary charges are charged to costs of goods sold in the period in which it occurs 
in determining market value  we review various factors such as current inventory levels  forecasted demand and technological obsolescence 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate the estimated market value of inventory 
however  if market conditions change  including changes in technology  product components used in our products or in expected sales  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax expense as well as assessing temporary differences in the treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income in each jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
we review deferred tax assets  including net operating losses and for those not expecting to be realized  we have created a valuation allowance 
if our estimates of future taxable income are not met  a valuation allowance for some of these deferred tax assets would be required 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions  both domestic and international and are subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  including challenges regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income amounts to various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by various tax authorities 
the united states internal revenue service irs recently completed the process of examining our us federal tax returns for fiscal years through we record our income tax provision based on our knowledge of all relevant facts and circumstances  including the existing tax laws  the status of current irs examinations and our understanding of how the tax authorities view certain relevant industry and commercial matters 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record reserves for probable exposures 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our tax contingencies reserve and income tax provision in the period in which actual results of a settlement with tax authorities differs from our established reserve  when the statue of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position  or when more information become available 
our tax contingencies reserve contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposure associated with our various filing positions 
we believe that any potential tax assessments from various tax authorities that are not covered by our income tax provision will not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position or cash flow 
some of the countries we are located in allow tax holidays or provide other tax incentives to attract and retain business 
we have obtained holidays or other incentives where available and practicable 
our taxes could increase if certain tax holidays or incentives are retracted which in some cases could occur if we fail to satisfy the conditions on which such holidays or incentives are based  or if they are not renewed upon expiration  or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased 
it is anticipated that tax incentives with respect to certain operations will expire within the next four years 
however  due to the possibility of changes in existing tax law and our operations  we are unable to predict how these expirations will impact us in the future 
in addition  acquisitions may cause our effective tax rate to increase  depending on the jurisdictions in which the acquired operations are located 
stock based compensation effective april   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  we recognized compensation expense for share based payments that vested during the twelve months ended april  using the following valuation methods a for share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   the grant date fair value was estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and b for share based payments granted on or after april   the grant date fair value was estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  which provides supplemental implementation guidance for sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of our adoption of sfas no 
r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based compensation 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and the presentation of our consolidated statement of cash flows 
however  we believe that stock based compensation aligns the interests of managers and non employee directors with the interests of shareholders 
as a result  we do not currently expect to significantly change our various stock based compensation programs 
we intend to implement the stock incentive plan  which is intended to replace the prior plans 
the stock incentive plan offers substantially similar benefits as the current plans as well as restricted stock and similar stock based compensation 
we do not expect that the adoption of the stock incentive plan will materially change our overall stock based compensation expense 
we use the black scholes standard option pricing model black scholes model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase rights 
the determination of the fair value of the awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions of other variables  including projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  expected volatility of our stock price in future periods and expected dividend yield 
we analyze historical employee exercise and termination data to estimate the expected life assumption 
we believe that historical data currently represents the best estimate of the expected life of a new employee option 
the risk free interest rate we use is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve on the grant date for a maturity similar to the expected life of the options 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock price in future periods by using the implied volatility in market traded options 
our decision to use implied volatility was based on the availability of actively traded options for our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than the historical volatility of our common stock 
we use an expected dividend yield consistent with our dividend yield over the period of time we have paid dividends in the black scholes option valuation model 
the amount of stock based compensation expense we recognize during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant by analyzing historical data and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expense in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our net earnings and net earnings per share of a future period 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in our consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  year ended april  april  april  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating income interest income expense  net other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income net sales fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase was across all three of our markets  with the commercial market showing the most significant growth on a percentage basis 
net sales increased both domestically and internationally 
as a percent of net sales  standard orders declined to approximately of net sales in fiscal as compared to in the previous fiscal year 
overall  we believe that orders and net sales will continue to grow in fiscal year  but at a smaller rate 
the highest growth rates for fiscal year are again expected to be in the commercial market however  as further explained below  the sports market could see greater growth depending on our success in a limited number of very large orders 
we also are expecting that international business could experience higher than the corporate average rate of growth 
we believe that all areas of our business were impacted by capacity constraints in the first half of fiscal year as the order volume during this period and the period preceding it exceeded expectations 
the constraints were diminished to acceptable levels during the fiscal year and we do not foresee any long term negative implications as a result of the constraints 
the increase in net sales in the commercial market in fiscal year over fiscal year was approximately on a worldwide basis 
this increase is attributed to both standard and custom projects 
the increase in custom projects is due primarily to the increase in orders from outdoor advertising companies and our success internationally  primarily in asian markets  while the increase in standard product orders is due to the growth in our galaxy and galaxypro displays both within the national account portion of our business and through resellers 
overall  the commercial market continues to benefit from increasing product acceptance  lower cost of displays  our expanding distribution network  international expansion and a better understanding by our customers of the product as a revenue generation tool 
for fiscal year  net sales exceeded our expectations set at the beginning of the year 
the most significant factor for exceeding these expectations was orders from outdoor advertising companies  which more than doubled 
this occurred primarily due to an increase in our customer base and the increasing amount of displays being purchased by existing customers 
we believe that the outdoor advertising business has a few important constraints to more rapid deployment  including regulatory and economic constraints which to date our customers have been successful at overcoming 
taking this into account  we expect this portion of our business to be one of the most important drivers of growth into fiscal year we expect that the growth in the commercial market will continue into fiscal year but at a lower rate 
the overall growth is due to our expanded distribution network  greater product acceptance  international expansion  the development of our resellers and integrated product offerings 
net sales in the commercial market should also expand at rates faster than our other markets and our national account business within the commercial market could grow faster depending on our success in booking major accounts in this niche 
we also expect to see growth generated through our new protour line of mobile and modular displays  which we believe will drive improvements in profitability internationally 
as the outdoor advertising business becomes a larger percent of our mix  we believe that seasonality of that business could become a factor as the deployment of displays softens in the winter months 
generally speaking  seasonality is not a material factor in the rest of the commercial business 
as we have reported in prior filings  we made significant investments in digital networks where the display media is primarily lcd and plasma screens  including investments in arena media networks  llc and fuelcast networks llc 
with fuelcast  we have in place one of the largest networks of advertising displays in the united states and we expect to expand this network significantly in fiscal year  which could require additional capital 
these affiliates intend to fund their growth with external financing sources 
we also intend to decrease our investment in arena media during the upcoming fiscal year 
our growth in the commercial market depends to some degree on the state of the economy  which we do not believe had any adverse effects in fiscal year as opposed to fiscal year the increase in net sales in the sports markets of approximately resulted from increases in sales to large and small sports venues 
net sales increased both domestically and internationally 
our sports market is subject to volatility based on the timing of large orders  especially orders for professional facilities  which can cause net sales to fluctuate year to year 
the mid sized and smaller facilities experience more consistency in growth rates due to the greater number of facilities 
the number of major new construction and renovation projects for professional facilities was not a significant factor in increasing net sales in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year we are expecting that new construction  primarily with professional facilities  could be a factor in increasing orders and sales in fiscal year and as new construction of sports facilities is expected to increase over the next few years 
this growth in sales for large and small sports venues was due to a number of factors  including the expanding market  with facilities spending more on larger display systems  our product and services offering  which remains the most integrated and comprehensive offering in the industry  and our network of sales and service offices  which are important to support our customers 
in addition  we benefit from the competitive nature of sports teams who strive to out perform their competitors with display systems 
this impact has and is expected to continue to be a driving force in increasing transaction sizes in new construction and major renovations 
this is also driven by the desire for high definition video displays which typically drive larger displays or higher resolution displays  both of which increase the average transaction size 
we believe that the effects of the economy have a lesser impact on the sports market as compared to our other markets because our products are generally revenue generation tools through advertising for facilities and the sports business is generally considered to be a recession resistant business 
net sales in our sports marketing portion of this business did not perform as well as expected and we do not expect that this portion of the business will grow materially in terms of net sales in fiscal year over fiscal year net sales in this sports marketing were less than of total sales for fiscal year an important factor in net sales for fiscal year will be our success in winning a limited number of very large contracts expected to be awarded in the sports market in fiscal year these transactions will generally range in value from million to potentially million and depending on which transactions if any we are awarded  we could see a significant variation in the level of net sales  primarily in the second half of the fiscal year and a significant increase in backlog 
as a result  the ultimate net sales growth in the sports market is difficult to estimate  but assuming that we prevail in winning projects based on our current market share  net sales to the sports market could expand in excess of 
orders as opposed to net sales in the sports market also performed much better in fiscal year as compared to this improved performance is due to the same reasons indicated for the increase in net sales in the sports market 
the increase in net sales in the transportation market for fiscal was approximately  resulting from an increase in spending on state and local transportation projects 
this increase  which relates primarily to sales of our vanguard product line  was due in part to furthering our penetration with more jurisdictions across the united states 
orders in the transportation market were up over for fiscal year versus fiscal year we believe that this increase is due to legislation passed during calendar year by congress that provided for increased spending on transportation projects  including large increases associated with intelligent transportation systems and as a result of gaining market share 
going into fiscal year  we expect that sales will continue to grow in excess of as a result of the gains we made in market share in fiscal year and the increased government spending  which we believe will continue 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net sales increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase was across all three markets  with the commercial market showing the most significant growth on a percentage basis 
net sales increased both domestically and internationally 
as a percent of net sales  standard orders declined to approximately of net sales in fiscal as compared to in the previous fiscal year 
the increase in net sales in the commercial market in fiscal year over fiscal year was on a worldwide basis 
this increase is attributed to both standard and custom projects 
the increase in custom projects was due primarily to the increase in orders from outdoor advertising companies  while the increase in standard product orders was due to the growth in our galaxy displays both within the national account portion of our business and through resellers 
overall  the commercial market benefited from increased product acceptance  lower cost of displays  our expanding distribution network and a better understanding by our customers of the product as a revenue generation tool 
for fiscal year  net sales exceeded our expectations set at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the most significant factor for exceeding these expectations was orders to outdoor advertising companies 
we believe this occurred primarily as a result of the efforts by the outdoor advertising industry to ease the permit process for displays and to gain an understanding as to how to maximize revenue generation on the displays and the reduced price points on the displays 
the increase in net sales in the sports markets of approximately resulted from increases in sales to large and small sports venues 
increases in net sales domestically in sports were partially offset by a decline on an international basis 
the number of major new construction and renovation projects for professional facilities in fiscal year was relatively flat as compared to the increase in sales to large sports venues for fiscal was attributable to increases in sales primarily for professional sports facilities 
this growth in sales for large and small sports venues was due to a number of factors  including the expanding market  with facilities spending more on larger display systems  our product and services offering  which remains the most integrated and comprehensive offering in the industry  and our network of sales and service offices  which are important to support our customers 
net sales in our sports marketing portion of this business did not perform as well as expected and were less than of total sales for fiscal year orders as opposed to net sales in the sports market also performed much better in fiscal year as compared to this improved performance is due to the same reasons indicated for the increase in net sales in the sports market 
the growth in orders was in the same areas as net sales 
on an international basis  orders declined in fiscal year from fiscal year  which we attribute to its inherent volatility 
the increase in net sales in the transportation market for fiscal  which was slightly less than  resulted from an increase in spending on state and local transportation projects 
this increase  which relates primarily to sales of our vanguard product line  was due in part to furthering our penetration with more jurisdictions across the united states 
orders in the transportation market were up over for fiscal year versus fiscal year we believe that we benefited from legislation passed during calendar year by congress that provided for increased spending on transportation projects  including large increases associated with intelligent transportation systems 
backlog our backlog at the end of fiscal year was million as compared to million at the end of fiscal year the growth in backlog as a percent of fiscal year backlog was the highest in the commercial market due to increased volume and the timing of order bookings 
backlog also increased over fiscal year in the sports and transportation markets 
overall  the increase was the result of the order bookings in the most recent quarter as compared to previous quarters 
backlog varies significantly quarter to quarter due to the effects of large orders and significant variations can be expected  as explained previously herein 
in addition  our backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales or net income  also as explained previously 
we occasionally sell products in exchange for advertising revenues from the scoreboard or display 
these revenues represented less than of net sales for each of fiscal years  and the gross profit margin on these net sales has historically been comparable to or higher than the gross profit margin on other net sales of similar sized installations 
gross profit fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above  partially offset by a decline in the gross profit percentage 
the most significant factors affecting gross profit margin included the costs of bringing additional capacity on line which included new facilities in three locations  higher costs of depreciation and inefficiencies in the manufacturing process  the costs associated with implementing lean manufacturing techniques  performance on contracts  the impact of operating at capacity during a significant portion of the year and higher overall warranty costs 
finally  the mix between small orders and large custom orders impacted the gross profit percentage adversely  as the small orders generally have margins in excess of and the large orders have margins of generally less than 
we continue to strive towards higher gross margins as a percent of net sales 
however  depending on the competitive environment  the actual mix and the level of future sales  the effects of new facilities  continued investment in lean manufacturing concepts and other factors described elsewhere in this report  margin percentages may not increase and could decrease 
the negative factors on gross profit are expected to be offset by the effects of process improvements in manufacturing and various other factors 
in light of these circumstances  we believe that the gross margin percentages could increase slightly in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  however  the impact of the large sports contracts mentioned above to the extent we are successful in winning them could have an adverse impact on the margin percent due to the competitive nature of that business but should drive improvement in earnings per share 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year gross profit increased to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percent of net sales  gross profit decreased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in gross margin dollars was due to the higher level of net sales discussed above  partially offset by a decline in the gross profit percentage 
the competitive environment year over year was the most significant factor impacting margins 
this competitive pressure drove pricing down on custom projects in the second half of fiscal year and into fiscal year in addition  gross profit margins were unusually high during the first half of fiscal year due to the lack of competitive pressures at that time in conjunction with manufacturing cost reductions 
the net effect of the competitive changes was a reduction of the margin for the year as a whole 
in addition  we believe that we incurred additional costs resulting from the rapid buildup of capacity during the year as we responded to the influx of orders and the increase in personnel required to build up the capacity 
other factors which impacted gross profit percentages were the decline in catalogue product sales as a percentage of net sales and higher costs associated with redesigns of our protour product line 
operating expenses fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative expenses and product design and development costs  increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
all areas within operating expenses were impacted by the implementation of sfas no 
r as discussed above  higher personnel costs to support our growth and higher benefit costs  consisting primarily of the cost of medical insurance  which increased substantially in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  the increase is attributable in general to the investment we made to position us for the market opportunities we see in the future 
in addition  we believe that as we grow  we need to make incremental investments which cause pressure on earnings early on but create leverage over time 
we believe that a significant portion of the increases in operating expense growth was necessary to position us for the future 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year operating expenses  which are comprised of selling  general and administrative expenses and product design and development costs  increased by to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year the changes in the various components of operating expenses are explained below 
all areas within operating expenses were impacted by higher personnel costs to support our growth and higher benefit costs  consisting primarily of the cost of medical insurance  which increased substantially in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  the decline is attributable to the incremental net sales in excess of that which was planned during the year and the inherent leverage that higher sales create in operating expenses 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  travel and entertainment expenses  facilities related costs for sales and service offices and expenditures for marketing efforts  including the costs of collateral materials  conventions and trade shows  product demos and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expenses was attributable to higher levels of personnel costs  international expansion  employee benefits  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  telephone costs  the increased number of sales and service offices and other costs associated with a higher number of employees 
the increase in the number of employees was planned to cover growth expectations across all markets and included the impact of hiring additional personnel to support various other investments made into growing areas  such as our services business  which is a core strategic growth area of the company  commercial sales  transportation sales and international operations 
the increase in travel and entertainment expense is due to having more employees in fiscal year and higher sales 
higher depreciation costs are primarily due to the increased investment in demonstration products and the support needs for the greater number of employees 
we expect to continue to invest in organic growth and therefore selling expenses will increase in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year however  as a percentage of net sales  we believe that selling expenses could decrease 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we are taking steps to slow the rate of growth of selling expenses and on a quarterly basis  we will reevaluate where we are as a percentage of orders to ensure that we meet our goal of reducing selling expense as a percentage of sales 
this expectation could change based on how much investment ultimately we make in current initiatives underway  including our geographical expansion and various other items 
we expect that during fiscal we will continue to invest in our services business within our markets to build the infrastructure to better support our customers for the long term 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year selling expenses increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling expenses were and of net sales in fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in selling expenses was attributable to higher levels of personnel costs  international expansion  employee benefits  travel and entertainment expenses  depreciation  telephone costs  rent expense  bad debt expense and other costs associated with a higher number of employees 
the increase in the number of employees was planned to cover growth expectations across all markets and included the impact of hiring additional personnel to support various other investments made into growing areas  such as sports marketing  narrowcasting  international operations  the increased number of domestic sales and service offices and other initiatives which existed partially or not at all during fiscal year the increase in travel and entertainment expense is due to having more employees in fiscal year and higher sales 
higher bad debt expense is attributable to the higher sales levels 
higher depreciation costs are primarily due to the increased investment in demonstration products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs  professional fees  shareholder relations costs  facilities and equipment related costs for administrative departments  training costs  amortization of intangibles and the costs of supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of net sales  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative costs were the result of higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support our growth  including international growth  higher travel costs related to new projects undertaken related to growth  higher professional and consulting fees  and significantly higher information technology and human resource related costs designed to position the company for future growth and opportunities 
we expect that for fiscal year  general and administrative expenses will decline as a percent of sales and  as with selling expenses  we are taking steps to curtail the rate of growth  which we intend to readdress each fiscal quarter 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year general and administrative costs increased to million in fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year as a percent of net sales  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
the increase in general and administrative costs were the result of higher costs of personnel and related infrastructure to support our growth  including international growth  higher bank fees related primarily to international transactions and letters of credit  greater amortization costs of intangibles  and higher phone costs 
these increases were offset by a decline in professional fees due to the one time costs incurred in fiscal year related to research and development tax credits  as described below 
product design and development expenses consist primarily of salaries  other employee related costs and facilities and equipment related costs and supplies 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
investments in our protour tm product line  narrowcasting solutions  our new line of prostar hd video displays and other display technologies and related items continued to drive increases in investments in new products 
in addition  we continued to invest across all other product lines  including display technologies  sound systems and control systems 
we developed new products  including our new line of vanguard roadside display trailers  full color video displays and a new pixel format for our prostar display product to address the high definition market and we invested heavily in initiatives designed to improve manufacturing processes and decreasing the costs of the product to us 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year product development expenses increased approximately to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year as a percent of sales  product development expenses were and of net sales for fiscal years and  respectively 
investments in our protour tm product line and related items continued to drive increases in investments in new products 
in addition  we continued to invest across all product lines  including display technologies  sound systems and control systems 
we developed new products  including our new line of galaxypro  full color video displays  a new four millimeter center to center pixel pitch prostar display  our line of procast lcd displays and a new line of high definition prostar displays 
interest income expense  net we occasionally sell products on an installment basis  under lease arrangements or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from displays  which result in long term receivables 
we also invest excess cash in marketable securities and temporary cash investments that generate interest income 
interest expense is comprised primarily of interest cost on our notes payable and other long term debt 
we occasionally sell products on an installment basis  under lease arrangements or in exchange for the rights to sell and retain advertising revenues from displays  which result in long term receivables 
we also invest excess cash in marketable securities and temporary cash investments that generate interest income 
interest expense is comprised primarily of interest cost on our notes payable and other long term debt 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income expense  net  decreased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year interest income was less than of net sales for each of fiscal years and the decrease was attributable to the reduction of temporary cash investments and marketable securities as a result of the decreased cash flow during the year and an increase in debt outstanding primarily to fund our capacity expansion during the year and media investments 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year interest income expense  net  increased to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year interest income was less than of net sales for each of fiscal years and the increase was attributable to the growth of temporary cash investments and marketable securities as a result of the increased cash flow during the year and a decrease in debt outstanding 
income taxes fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes decreased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the decrease was attributable primarily to the increase in income before taxes which was more than offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate 
the effective rate decreased to approximately in fiscal year from approximately in fiscal year this decrease in the effective rate is due primarily to the completion of an irs audit of fiscal years through which included primarily the benefits of research and development tax credits 
in addition  we benefited from the lower tax rates in asia  where we were able to generate taxable income which is subject to a tax holiday for a fixed period of time after we began operations there 
finally  we benefited from a retroactive enactment of the research and development tax credit which had previously expired 
we expect that the effective rate in fiscal year will increase because the benefit of the irs audit and the effect of the retroactive reenactment of the research and development credit were one time benefits 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year income taxes increased to million in fiscal year as compared to million in fiscal year the increase was attributable primarily to the increase in income before taxes and the effective tax rate 
the effective rate increased to approximately in fiscal year from approximately in fiscal year this increase in the effective rate was due primarily to the effects of the recognition of research and development tax credits related to prior years in fiscal year that did not repeat in fiscal year in addition  due to the expiration of the research and development tax credit at the end of calendar year  we were not able to benefit from this credit for the last four months of fiscal year finally  we realized a net benefit related to the implementation of the deduction available for domestic production activities  net of the decrease of extraterritorial income benefits 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at april  compared to million at april  we have historically financed working capital needs through a combination of cash flow from operations and borrowings under bank credit agreements 
cash provided by operations for fiscal year was million 
net income of million plus depreciation and amortization of million and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and warranty obligations were partially offset by increases in inventory  accounts receivable  prepaid expenses  long term receivables  customer deposits  deferred income taxes  inventories  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  billings in excess excess of costs and estimated earnings and advertising rights 
the overall changes in operating assets and liabilities is due generally to the impact of the timing of cash flows on large projects  which can cause significant fluctuations in the short term 
as a result of various initiatives underway  including changes in manufacturing  purchasing  collections and payment process  we expect to continue improving our cash flow relative to sales and costs of goods 
cash used by investing activities in fiscal included million used to purchase property and equipment 
during fiscal year  we invested in excess of million in new facilities  million in leasehold improvements  million in manufacturing equipment  consisting of tooling for new product lines  electronic assembly and metal fabrication equipment and various other items  million on information systems hardware and software  million in equipment to be used as demonstration equipment  million in rental equipment  including our protour tm rental units  million in transportation equipment  and million of office equipment 
these purchases were made to support our continued growth  separate plants to support the business unit reorganization described above  finance plant expansions in redwood falls  minnesota and sioux falls  south dakota and to replace obsolete equipment 
other cash provided by investing activities included million in proceeds resulting from sales of marketable securities 
in early fiscal  we began construction of a new building in brookings  south dakota to be used primarily for office and warehouse space 
to date  we have spent approximately million on the building and expect the total cost to be approximately million  including furniture and fixtures 
we also are expecting to increase our investment in our redwood falls  minnesota manufacturing facilities primarily as a result of the success we are having with galaxy displays and gas price digit displays 
we consider these two areas the completion of the major manufacturing capacity expansion efforts we began in fiscal year in addition  we expect to invest approximately million in other capital expenditures throughout fiscal we believe that in fiscal year  investments in capital assets will decrease and that over the long term  we will increase our cash and marketable securities  while decreasing the level of debt 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal included million borrowed from the line of credit  million received for option exercises and million from excess tax benefits from stock based compensation  offset by million paid for the dividend to shareholders and million of long term debt principal 
included in receivables as of april  was approximately million of retainage on long term contracts  all of which is expected to be collected in one year 
we have used and expect to continue to use cash reserves and  to a lesser extent  bank borrowings to meet our short term working capital requirements 
on large product orders  the time between order acceptance and project completion may extend up to and exceed months depending on the amount of custom work and the customer s delivery needs 
we often receive down payments or progress payments on these product orders 
to the extent that these payments are not sufficient to fund the costs and other expenses associated with these orders  we use working capital and bank borrowings to finance these cash requirements 
our product development activities include the enhancement of existing products and the development of new products from existing technologies 
product development expenses for fiscal years  and were  million and million  respectively 
we intend to continue to incur these expenditures to develop new display products and solutions using various technologies to offer higher resolution and more cost effective and energy efficient displays  as well as to complement the services and solutions that are provided with the displays 
we also intend to continue developing software applications related to our display systems to enable these products to continue to meet the needs and expectations of the marketplace 
we have a credit agreement with a bank which provides for a million line of credit and includes up to million for standby letters of credit 
the line of credit is due on november  the interest rate ranges from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points depending on certain ratios 
the effective interest rate was at april  starting january   we are assessed a loan fee equal to per annum of any non used portion of the loan 
as of april   million was advanced under the line of credit 
the credit agreement is unsecured and requires us to comply with certain covenants  including the maintenance of tangible net worth of at least million  a minimum liquidity ratio  a limit on dividends and distributions and a minimum adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio 
daktronics canada  inc has a credit agreement with a bank which provides for a million line of credit 
the line of credit is due on april  the interest rate on the line of credit is equal to above the prime rate of interest and was at april  as of april   no advances under the line of credit were outstanding 
the line of credit is secured primarily by accounts receivables  inventory and other assets of the subsidiary 
we are sometimes required to obtain performance bonds for display installations 
we currently have a bonding line available through a surety company that provides for an aggregate of million in bonded work outstanding 
at april   we had million of bonded work outstanding against this line 
we believe that if our growth extends beyond current expectations or if we make any strategic investments  we may need to increase the amount of our credit facility or seek other means of financing our growth 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain any needed funds under commercially reasonable terms from our current lender or other sources 
we believe that our working capital available from all sources will be adequate to meet the cash requirements of our operations in the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commitments we enter into various debt  lease  purchase and marketing obligations that require payments in future periods 
debt obligations represent primarily bank loans 
operating lease obligations relate primarily to leased office space 
long term marketing obligations relate to payment due in future periods for payments on sales where we sold and installed our equipment in exchange for future advertising revenue 
when certain advertising revenue thresholds are met  all or a portion of excess cash is owed back to the customer 
unconditional purchase obligations represent future payments for inventory and advertising rights purchase commitments 
as of april   our debt  lease and purchase obligations were as follows contractual obligations total less than year years years after years cash commitments long term debt and accrued interest  long term marketing obligations and accrued interest operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations   total    other commercial commitments line of credit and accrued interest   standby letters of credit inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or our financial condition  although it could in the future

 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas no

the adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rates through april   most of our net sales were denominated in united states dollars and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes has not been significant 
net sales originating outside the united states for fiscal year were approximately of total net sales  of which a portion was denominated in canadian dollars  euros  chinese renminbi or british pounds 
in fiscal  net sales to international markets may increase as a percentage of net sales and  consequently  a greater portion of this business could be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  operating results may become subject to fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we will continue to monitor and minimize our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  use financial hedging techniques  including foreign currency forward contracts and options  to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
however  exchange rate fluctuations as well as differing economic conditions  changes in political climates  differing tax structures and other rules and regulations could adversely affect our financial results in the future 
interest rate risks our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt and long term accounts receivable 
we maintain a blend of both fixed and floating rate debt instruments 
as of april   our outstanding debt was million  substantially all of which was in variable rate obligations 
each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have an million annual effect on variable rate debt interest based on the balances of such debt as of april  for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect our fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows
