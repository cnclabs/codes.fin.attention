part i item business 
general we are a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the clinical development  manufacture  marketing and distribution of new drug therapies based on natural immune system enhancing technologies for the treatment of viral and immune based chronic disorders 
the company was founded in the early s doing contract research for the national institutes of health 
since that time  we have established a strong foundation of laboratory  pre clinical  and clinical data with respect to the development of nucleic acids to enhance the natural antiviral defense system of the human body and to aid the development of therapeutic products for the treatment of certain chronic diseases 
our flagship products include ampligen and alferon n injection 
ampligen is an experimental drug currently undergoing clinical development for the treatment of myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs or cfs  and hiv 
in august  we completed a phase iii clinical trial amp treating over me cfs patients with ampligen and are presently in the registration process for a new drug application nda with the food and drug administration fda 
over its developmental history  ampligen has received various designations  including orphan drug product designation fda  emergency compassionate cost recovery sales authorization fda and promising clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports ahrq  agency health research quality 
based on the results of published  peer reviewed pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we believe that ampligen may have broad spectrum anti viral and anti cancer properties 
approximately patients have participated in ampligen clinical trials authorized by the fda at over twenty clinical trial sites across the us  representing the administration of more than  doses of this drug 
alferon n injection is the registered trademark for our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon  which is approved by the fda for the treatment of genital warts 
alferon n injection is also in pre clinical development for treating multiple sclerosis  west nile virus and sars

our products our primary products consist of our experimental compound  ampligen  our fda approved natural interferon product  alferon n injection and alferon ldo low dose oral our experimental liquid natural interferon for oral administration 
ampligen nucleic acid compounds represent a potential new class of pharmaceutical products that are designed to act at the molecular level for treatment of human diseases 
there are two forms of nucleic acids  dna and rna 
dna is a group of naturally occurring molecules found in chromosomes  the cell s genetic machinery 
rna is a group of naturally occurring informational molecules which orchestrate a cell s behavior which regulates the action of groups of cells  including the cells which compromise the body s immune system 
rna directs the production of proteins and regulates certain cell activities including the activation of an otherwise dormant cellular defense against viruses and tumors 
our drug technology utilizes specifically configured rna 
our double stranded rna drug product  trademarked ampligen  an experimental  unapproved drug  which is administered intravenously  is in human clinical development for various therapeutically oriented studies  including treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome myalgic encephalomyelitis cfs me  hiv  renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma 
based on the results of pre clinical studies and clinical trials  we believe that ampligen  an experimental agent  may have broad spectrum anti viral and anti cancer properties 
approximately patients have received ampligen in clinical trials authorized by the food and drug administration fda at over twenty clinical trial sites across the us  representing the administration of more than  doses of this drug 
ampligen is available only through clinical trials for limited indications 
clinical trials already conducted by us include treatments of me cfs  hepatitis b  hiv  and cancer patients with renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma 
certain of these will require additional clinical trials to support regulatory approval 
we believe that ampligen has been generally well tolerated with a low incidence of clinical toxicity  particularly given the severely debilitating or life threatening diseases that have been treated 
a mild flushing reaction has been observed in approximately of patients treated in our various studies 
this reaction is occasionally accompanied by erythema  a tightness of the chest  tachycardia  anxiety  shortness of breath  subjective reports of feeling hot  sweating and nausea 
the reaction is usually infusion rate related and can generally be controlled by slowing the infusion rate 
other adverse side effects include liver enzyme level elevations  diarrhea  itching  urticaria swelling of the skin  bronchospasm  hypotension  photophobia  rash  bradycardia  transient visual disturbances  arrhythmias  decreased platelets and white blood cell counts  anemia  dizziness  confusion  elevation of kidney function tests  occasional temporary hair loss and various flu like symptoms  including fever  chills fatigue  muscular aches  joint pains  headaches  nausea and vomiting 
these flu like side effects typically subside within several months 
the fda has approved the use of ampligen in treating me cfs on an emergency basis ie those with immediate life threatening illnesses 
this is known as a treatment ind  or treatment investigational new drug 
furthermore  the fda has granted hemispherx orphan drug status in the united states 
orphan drugs get seven years of market exclusivity upon fda approval 
we are in the process of completing our registration of an nda with the fda for the use of ampligen in the treatment of patients with me cfs 
alferon n injection interferons are a group of proteins produced and secreted by cells to combat diseases 
researchers have identified four major classes of human interferon alpha  beta  gamma and omega 
the alferon n injection product contains a multi species form of alpha interferon 
the worldwide market for injectable alpha interferon based products has experienced rapid growth and various alpha interferon injectable products are approved for many major medical uses worldwide 
alpha interferons are manufactured commercially in three ways by genetic engineering  by cell culture  and from human white blood cells 
all three of these types of alpha interferon are or were approved for commercial sale in the us our natural alpha interferon is produced from human white blood cells 
the potential advantages of natural alpha interferon over recombinant synthetic interferon produced and marketed by other pharmaceutical firms may be based upon their respective molecular compositions 
natural alpha interferon is composed of a family of proteins containing many molecular species of interferon 
in contrast  recombinant alpha interferon each contain only a single species 
researchers have reported that the various species of interferons may have differing antiviral activity depending upon the type of virus 
natural alpha interferon presents a broad complement of species  which we believe may account for its higher activity in laboratory studies 
natural alpha interferon is also glycosylated partially covered with sugar molecules 
such glycosylation is not present on the currently us marketed recombinant alpha interferons 
we believe that the absence of glycosylation may be  in part  responsible for the production of interferon neutralizing antibodies seen in patients treated with recombinant alpha interferon 
although cell culture derived interferon is also composed of multiple glycosylated alpha interferon species  the types and relative quantity of these species are different from our natural alpha interferon 
the fda approved alferon n injection in for the intralesional within lesions treatment of refractory resistant to other treatment or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older 
certain types of human papillomaviruses hpv cause genital warts  a sexually transmitted disease std 
a published report estimates that approximately eight million new and recurrent causes of genital warts occur annually in the united states alone 
alferon n injection 
interferon alfa n human leukocyte derived 
is a highly purified  natural source  glycosylated  multi species alpha interferon product 
there are essentially no antibodies observed against natural interferon to date and the product has a relatively low side effect profile 
alferon is the only natural source  multi species alpha interferon currently sold in the us the recombinant dna derived alpha interferon are now reported to have decreased effectiveness after one year  probably due to antibody formation and other severe toxicities 
these detrimental effects have not been reported with the use of alferon n injection which could allow this product to assume a much larger market share 
it is our belief that the use of alferon n in combination with ampligen has the potential to increase the positive therapeutic responses in chronic life threatening viral diseases 
combinational therapy is evolving to the standard of acceptable medical care as demonstrated by the antiviral responses achieved by haart highly active antiviral therapy in the multi drug treatment of hiv 
the broad spectrum activity of alferon n is evidenced by clinical trials currently underway for the treatment of multiple viral disorders including hepatitis c  hiv hcv co infection and west nile virus 
alferon low dose oral ldo alferon ldo is an experimental low dose  oral liquid formulation of natural alpha interferon and like alferon n injection should not cause antibody formation  which is a problem with recombinant interferon 
it is an experimental immunotherapeutic believed to work by stimulating an immune cascade response in the cells of the mouth and throat  enabling it to bolster systemic immune response through the entire body by absorption through the oral mucosa 
oral interferon would be much more economically feasible for patients and logistically manageable in development programs in third world countries primarily affected by hiv and other emerging viruses sars  ebola  bird flu  etc oral administration of alferon n  with its affordability  low toxicity  no production of antibodies  and broad range of potential bio activity  could be a breakthrough treatment for viral diseases 
we have initiated clinical trials as part of an accelerated evaluation of the experimental bio therapeutic alferon ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n human leukocyte derived as a potential new experimental therapy for avian flu and other lethal viral diseases  which have high acute death rates 
clinical trials in human volunteers being conducted in both the us at drexel university  philadelphia and shortly to commence in hong kong at the princess margaret hospital are designed to determine whether alferon n  delivered in a new  experimental oral drug delivery format  can resuscitate the broad spectrum antiviral and immunostimulatory genes 
these human genes are shut down by acute lethal viral infections such as avian flu and smallpox 
oragens we acquired a series of patents on oragens  potentially a set of oral broad spectrum antivirals and immunological enhancers  through a licensing agreement with temple university in philadelphia  pa 
we were granted an exclusive worldwide license from temple for the oragens products 
these compounds have been evaluated in various academic laboratories for application to chronic viral and immunological disorders 
the  oligoadenylate synthetase rnase l system is an important and widely distributed pathway for the inhibition of viral replication and tumor growth 
the  oligoadenylate synthetase  up activation by double stranded rna  synthesizes  oligoadenylates a from atp 
these bioactive as directly activate rnase l  which degrades viral and cellular rnas resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis 
the bioactive a molecules can be degraded by various hydrolytic enzymes  resulting in a short half life 
analogues of these bioactive as  termed oragen rna compounds  have been produced to increase stability and maintain or increase biological activity without demonstrable toxicity 
additional pre clinical tests will be conducted prior to pursuing clinical trials see research  consulting  licensing and supply agreements section of item i for more details on this license 
patents we have over patents worldwide with additional patents pending comprising our intellectual property 
in  we obtained the global patent rights for a compound that enhances dna vaccination by the efficient intracellular delivery of immunogenic dna ie dna that can produce antigenic proteins that simulate an acute viral infection with a resultant umoral and cell mediated immune response 
see research  consulting  licensing and supply agreements section within item i for more information on the acquisition of these patents 
we continually review our patents rights to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans for both ampligen  alferon n and other intellectual property 
we have been issued certain patents on the use of ampligen alone and ampligen in combination with certain other drugs including azt  ddi  ddc  interferon and or il  for the treatment of hiv 
our experimental compounds  which have yet to be determined safe and effective by regulatory authorities  are accordingly only available legally in certain authorized trials and tests  in vitro outside the body tests are also not necessarily indicative of any evidence of clinical benefits or advantages 
but the focus of hemispherx is on ampligen as a treatment for cfs me and hiv 
the main us me cfs treatment patent expires october  our main patents covering hiv treatment   and expired or expire on april   november   and february   respectively  hepatitis treatment coverage is conveyed by us patent which expires on january  the us ampligen trademark  expires on december  and can be renewed thereafter for an additional years 
the fda has granted us orphan drug status for our nucleic acid derived therapeutics for me cfs  hiv  and renal cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma 
orphan drug status grants us protection against competition for a period of seven years following fda approval  as well as certain federal tax incentives  and other regulatory benefits 
patent coverage for the hiv indication following the expiration of patents  and is planned to be obtained from patent pending application pct us in the event that this patent application is not approved  we still have the marketing protection provided by the orphan drug designation for using ampligen to treat hiv 
the us alferon patents expire february   and  and december  
research and development r d our focus is on developing drugs for use in treating viral and immune based chronic disorders and diseases including me cfs  hiv  hpv  sars and west nile virus 
our current r d projects target treatment therapies for me cfs  hiv  hpv and other viral diseases  ie  sars and avian seasonal influenza 
myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome me cfs chronic fatigue syndrome cfs  also known as chronic immune dysfunction syndrome cfids and  myalgic encephalomyelitis me is a serious and debilitating chronic illness and a major public health problem 
long misunderstood  under recognized  and under diagnosed  me cfs is now recognized by both the government and private sector as a major health problem  including the national institutes of health  us centers for disease control and prevention cdc  fda and social security administration  recognizes me cfs as one of the most common chronic illnesses of our time 
the cdc listed me cfs as a priority disease  causing severe health and financial problems for the patients  their family  and the community 
me cfs is endemic in the population  but occasionally seen in clusters suggesting an infectious basis 
a variety of immunological  endocrine  autonomic nervous system  and metabolic abnormalities have been documented 
a groundbreaking  community based study of me cfs by dr 
leonard jason was published in the archives of internal medicine in and showed a prevalence rate of of every  americans 
as many as  people nationwide suffer from cfs  significantly more than previously estimated by the cdc 
furthermore  of the patients with the illness are struggling without the benefit of medical diagnosis or treatment 
while me cfs strikes people of all age  racial  ethnic  and socioeconomic groups  it is most prevalent amongst women 
research has shown that me cfs is about three times as common in women as men  a rate similar to that of many autoimmune diseases  such as multiple sclerosis and lupus 
to put this into perspective  me cfs is over four times more common than hiv infection in women  and the rate of me cfs in women is considerably higher than a woman s lifetime risk of getting lung cancer as published by the cfids association of america 
the most common symptom of me cfs is incapacitating fatigue  which does not subside with rest 
many severe me cfs patients become completely disabled or totally bedridden and are afflicted with severe pain and mental confusion even at rest 
this debilitating tiredness is associated with flu like symptoms such as chills  fever  headache  sore throat  painful lymph nodes  muscle aches  weakness and joint pain 
diagnosis of me cfs is a time consuming and difficult process which is generally arrived at by excluding other illnesses with similar symptoms and comparing a patient s symptoms with the case definition 
overlapping symptoms can occur with several diseases  such as fibromyalgia  gulf war illnesses  and multiple chemical sensitivities 
many diseases have similar symptoms including lupus and lyme disease which so closely mimic me cfs that they need to be considered when making a diagnosis to rule them out 
the case definition for me cfs criteria calls for certain symptoms to be present along with fatigue that interferes with physical  mental  social  and educational activities 
both the fatigue and symptoms must have occurred for at least a six month period 
people with me cfs may experience many more than the symptoms named in the case definition  so knowledgeable physicians will take this fact into consideration when making a diagnosis after other possible reasons for symptoms have been ruled out 
the leading model of me cfs pathogenesis is thought to be rooted in abnormalities in the immune system and brain central nervous system  both of which affects and alters the function of the other 
because some cases of chronic fatigue begin with a flu like infection  several viruses have been studied as possible causes because all are relatively common in the general population  including human herpesvirus hhv and  retroviruses  epstein barr virus  enteroviruses  as well as  mycoplasmas  etc 
whilst  the etiology is likely to be caused by a collection of factors  including viral  hormonal  stress  and other triggers for the illness in genetically  environmentally or otherwise susceptible individuals and continues to be a subject of discussion 
most me cfs patients are treated symptomatically with traditional treatments geared toward treating symptoms of the disease  such as improving quality of sleep  reducing pain and treatment of depression 
clinically  a number of different therapeutic approaches have been pursued  but with no significant clinical success 
in  we were authorized by the fda to initiate a phase iii multicenter  placebo controlled  randomized  double blind clinical trial to treat patients with me cfs in the us the objective of this phase iii  clinical study  denoted as amp  was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ampligen as a treatment for me cfs 
over the course of the study  we engaged the services of clinical investigators at medical centers in california  new jersey  florida  north carolina  wisconsin  pennsylvania  nevada  illinois  utah and connecticut 
these clinical investigators were medical doctors with special knowledge of me cfs who have recruited  prescreened and enrolled me cfs patients for inclusion in the phase iii amp me cfs clinical trial 
this clinical trial enrolled and randomized over me cfs patients 
we completed drug dosing in this trial in august a preliminary review of the data collected during this trial indicated that ampligen improved exercise treadmill performance by versus in the placebo group  or more than twice the minimum considered medically significant  a statistically significant increase p 
the major significance is the ability to safely obtain medical benefits increased physical performance which have largely eluded others 
also  ampligen significantly improved important secondary endpoints associated with quality of life 
there was no significant difference in the number of serious adverse events  suggesting that the drug was generally well tolerated 
given that the fda has already granted ampligen treatment protocol status and orphan drug status based on earlier studies  we believe these medically and statistically significant results  when finalized  will facilitate fda review and approval of ampligen as a therapy to treat me cfs 
we are in the process of completing a nda requesting fda approval for using ampligen to treat me cfs 
human immunodeficiency virus hiv over fifteen antiviral drugs are currently approved by the fda for the treatment of hiv infection 
most target the specific hiv enzymes  reverse transcriptase rt and protease 
the use of various combinations of three or more of these drugs is often referred to as highly active anti retroviral therapy haart 
haart involves the utilization of several antiretrovirals with different mechanisms of action to decrease viral loads in hiv infected patients 
the goal of these combination treatments is to reduce the amount of hiv in the body viral load to as low as possible 
experience has shown that using combinations of drugs from different classes is a more effective strategy than using only one or two drugs 
haart has provided dramatic decreases in morbidity and mortality of hiv infection 
subsequent experience has provided a more realistic view of haart and the realization that chronic hiv suppression using haart  as currently practiced  would require treatment for life with resulting significant cumulative toxicities 
the various reverse transcriptase and protease inhibitor drugs that go into haart have significantly reduced the morbidity and mortality connected with hiv  however there has been a significant morbidity due to drug toxicity 
it was estimated that of hiv deaths were from the toxicity of the drugs in haart 
some estimates suggest that it would require as many as years of haart for elimination of hiv in the infected patient 
thus the toxicity of haart drugs and the enormous cost of treatment make this goal impractical 
we believe that the concept of strategic therapeutic interruption sti of haart provides a unique opportunity to minimize the current deficiencies of haart while retaining the hiv suppression capacities of haart 
sti is the cessation of haart until hiv again becomes detectable ie  rebounds followed by resumption of haart with subsequent suppression of hiv 
by re institution of haart  hiv may be suppressed before it can inflict damage to the immune system of the patient 
we believe that ampligen combined with the sti approach may offer a unique opportunity to retain haart s superb ability to suppress hiv while potentially minimizing its deficiencies 
all present approved drugs block certain steps in the life cycles of hiv 
none of these drugs address the immune system  as ampligen potentially does  although hiv is an immune based disease 
by using ampligen in combination with sti of haart  we will undertake to boost the patients own immune system s response to help them control their hiv when they are off of haart 
our minimum expectation is that ampligen has potential to lengthen the haart free time interval with a resultant decrease in haart induced toxicities 
the ultimate potential  which of course requires full clinical testing to accept or reject the hypothesis  is that ampligen may potentiate sti of haart to the point that the cell mediated immune system will be sufficient to eliminate the requirement for haart 
clinical results of using our technology has been presented at several international aids scientific forums 
our amp hiv study is a treatment using a strategic treatment interruption sti 
the patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
patients who have completed at least nine months of ampligen therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks where as the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
enrollment in this study has been temporarily suspended pending the completion of our ampligen nda registration process with the fda 
at this time  forty one hiv patients have participated in this week study 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  causing competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment may compete for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial will be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we may obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
human papilloma virus hpv human papilloma virus hpv is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted infection in the world 
experts estimate that there are more cases of genital hpv infection than of any other sexually transmitted disease std in the united states 
overall  in the united states  an estimated million people are currently infected with hpv 
roughly  six million people are infected every year 
it has been estimated that at least of sexually active men and women acquire genital hpv infection at some point in their lives 
genital warts are the most recognized sign of a genital hpv infection 
treating genital warts does not cure a hpv infection 
the virus remains in the body in an inactive state after warts are removed 
a person treated for genital warts may still be able to transmit the infection 
common methods for removing genital warts involve surgically removing them 
cryotherapy is a method that entails freezing off the wart with liquid nitrogen and is relatively inexpensive  safe and effective 
the downside to this procedure beyond the pain factor is it must be performed by a trained health care provider 
laser therapy using an intense light to destroy the warts or surgery cutting off the warts has the advantage of getting rid of warts in a single office visit 
however  treatment can be expensive and the operator must be well trained in these methods 
in addition  surgery will most likely cause scarring over the afflicted area 
there are a number of topical creams and solutions available to treat genital warts 
bloodroot paste is made from naturally occurring substances  but its effects on treating genital warts are not conclusively supportive 
condylox also called podophyllin is a brown liquid that causes a burning sensation as it dries  but it must be washed off within four to six hours to reduce the risk of adverse reactions 
condylox can be quite expensive as well 
condysil is a cream that may be applied 
it consists of all natural ingredients and its manufacturer claims it produces no scarring 
the current leading treatment of genital warts is the topical cream aldara  however the reoccurrence rate may be as high as when this drug is used 
treatment for genital warts may also come in the form of injections 
intron a is a substance that must be injected times weekly and alferon n  which is the only natural source  multi species alpha interferon currently sold in the us for hpv treatment  is injected twice weekly 
hepatitis c virus hcv hepatitis c infection is typically mild in its early stages  and is often not diagnosed until a late state when it has caused severe liver disease 
a typical cycle of disease from infection to symptomatic liver disease can take years  therefore  the true impact of hcv may not be fully apparent 
hepatitis c is believed to be transmitted only by blood 
however  unlike many other blood borne viruses like hcv  virtually any source of blood products seems to be capable of carrying the virus  even if the source is indirect like a used razor  for example 
this makes hepatitis c far more transmittable than most other blood borne viruses including hiv 
hepatitis c is an rna virus 
once an infection has begun  hepatitis c creates different genetic variations of itself within the body of the host 
the mutated forms are frequently different enough from their ancestor that the immune system cannot recognize them 
thus  even if the immune system begins to succeed against one variation  the mutant strains quickly take over and become new  predominant strains 
thus  the development of antibodies against hcv may not produce an immunity against the disease like it does with most other viruses 
more than of individuals infected with hcv will progress to a chronic form of the disease 
the world health organization estimates that more than million people in the united states are infected with hepatitis c and more than million worldwide 
a vaccine against hepatitis c is not available and there are many times more people infected with hcv than hiv the virus that causes aids 
it is anticipated that without prompt intervention to treat infected populations  the death rate from hepatitis c could surpass that from aids 
alferon n injection has been studied for the potential treatment of hiv  hepatitis c and other indications 
isi  the company from which hemispherx obtained rights to alferon n injection  has conducted clinical trials with regard to the use of alferon n injection in the treatment of hiv and hepatitis c 
while isi found the results to be encouraging  in both instances the fda determined that additional trials were necessary 
our plans for additional clinical hcv clinical trials are on hold at this time 
other viral diseases we are actively engaged in broad based ongoing experimental studies assessing the efficacy of our products ampligen  alferon n injection and alferon ldo against influenza viruses as an adjuvant and or single agent antiviral with the defence r d canada  the national institute of infectious diseases in tokyo  the princess margaret hospital in hong kong and various research affiliates of the national institutes of health in the united states 
a preclinical study was initiated in june  to determine if ampligen enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian influenza 
the preclinical study suggests a new  and potentially pivotal role of double stranded rna dsrna therapeutics in improving the efficacy of the present standards in care in both influenza prevention and treatment of acute disease 
the preclinical study is being conducted by research affiliates of the national institutes of health at utah state university to examine potential therapeutic synergies with different drug combinations 
the ongoing research is comparing the relative protection conveyed by tamiflu oseltamivir  roche and relenza zanamivir  glaxosmithkline with ampligen dsrna  alone and in combination  against the avian flu virus hn 
cell destruction was measured in vitro using different drug combinations 
both drugs  given alone  were effective in inhibiting cell destruction by avian influenza  but viral suppression with the combination was greater than either drug alone 
the overall assessment is that there was improvement in cell protection when ampligen was combined with oseltamivir carboxylate tamiflu and zanamivir relenza 
further immediate experimental tests are planned 
japanese researchers journal of virology page  found that dsrnas increase the effectiveness of influenza vaccine by more than and may also convey cross protection ability against variant viruses mutated strains of influenza virus 
in october  we signed a research agreement with the national institute of infectious diseases  in tokyo  japan 
the collaboration  by hideki hasegawa  md  phd  chief of the laboratory of infectious disease pathology  assesses our experimental therapeutic ampligen as a co administered immunotherapeutic to the institution s nasal flu vaccine 
on october  dr 
hideki hasegawa  of japan s national institute of infectious diseases jniid  presented the results of his studies co administering hemispherx s double stranded rna dsrna ampligen polyi polyc 
u experimental therapeutic with a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus hpaiv vaccine 
dr 
hasegawa s studies  presented at the second international conference on influenza vaccines for the world in vienna  austria  examined the protective efficacy of intranasal co administration of inactivated whole virion hn vaccine with ampligen in mice and non human primates 
intranasal administration of a candidate influenza vaccine with ampligen resulted in secretion of iga  also known as immunoglobulin a  the basis of mucosal immunity  and successfully protected experimental animals that were subsequently challenged with homologous a vietnam hn  heterologous a hk hn and a indonesia hn viruses 
dr 
hasegawa s data demonstrates that the intranasal administration of ampligen combined with hn vaccine induced cross protective mucosal immunity against homologous and heterologous hn influenza virus infection in mice  intranasal administration of ampligen combined with hn vaccine provided protection in the macaque monkey  a non human primate which has a complex immune system  similar to that of humans  from hn infection  seasonal human influenza vaccine plus ampligen administered intranasally in mice provided protective immune responses with apparent cross protection against avian influenza virus challenge  nasal administration of influenza virus vaccines an conjunction with a tlr agonist is an effective method of vaccination  and ampligen  a tlr agonist  is the only human applicable dsrna which has a well documented safety profile in humans 
dr 
hasegawa and his colleagues at the jniid intend to pursue human trials as soon as possible 
pre clinical research indicates that ampligen can provide cross protection against avian flu viral mutations as well as boost the effectiveness of tamiflu and relenza  the only two drugs formally recognized for combating bird flu  up to times 
other lab tests  in healthy human volunteers  indicate that alferon ldo low dose oral  a new delivery form of an anti viral with prior regulatory approval for a category of sexually transmitted diseases  can stimulate a broad immune and antiviral gene modulation induce key components in the body s defense system 
the studies were conducted in conjunction with utah state university and drexel university 
defence r d canada  suffield drdc suffield  an agency of the canadian department of national defence  is evaluating the antiviral efficacy of our experimental therapeutic ampligen and alferon for protection against human respiratory influenza virus infection in well validated animal models 
drdc suffield is conducting research and development of new drugs that could potentially become part of the arsenal of existing antiviral weapons to combat the bird flu 
the initial study focused on the testing of potential drugs against the respiratory influenza virus infection on a mouse adapted strain of human influenza 
drdc suffield had previously conducted extensive research in the use of liposome delivery technology to enhance the antiviral activity of a closely allied ampligen analogue  poly iclc an immunomodulating dsrna which is very similar to ampligen 
results suggest that ribo nucleic acid based drugs have the ability to elicit protective broad spectrum antiviral immunity against various pathogenic viruses 
hence  there is the potential for efficacy to be maintained against mutating strains of an influenza virus 
liposomes  a carrier system for nucleic acid based drugs  have shown an ability to protect these drugs against in vivo degradation  delivering them to intracellular sites of infection  thereby reducing any toxicity and prolonging their therapeutic effectiveness 
protection can be afforded for days with two doses of dsrna 
initial studies reported by drdc suffield indicated that ampligen was effective in a mouse model of avian hn infection by decreasing death rates 
a clinical study conducted at the princess margaret hospital in hong kong evaluated the use of alferon ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n  human leukocyte derived to determine the affect on genes associated with anti viral and immunological functions in normal volunteers 
this study completed the dosing of ten patients 
the initial analysis of data from this study is complete 
a more definitive evaluation protocol is being developed to further validate the results 
the initial results  conducted in collaboration with the cleveland clinic  did indicate that the alferon ldo stimulated gene banks associated with an antiviral immune response in these otherwise healthy volunteers 
a paneled clinical study to evaluate the use of alferon ldo in hiv infected volunteers was conducted in philadelphia  pa 
the study was conducted at two sites  drexel university and philadelphia fight  a comprehensive aids service organization providing primary care  consumer education  advocacy and research on potential treatments and vaccines 
the study was designed to determine whether alferon ldo can resuscitate the broad spectrum antiviral and immunostimulatory genes 
as of january  twenty two patients have enrolled and completed dosing 
we are currently receiving data from this study and we are in the process of analyzing the results along with the results from the alferon ldo study conducted in hong kong 
this methodology may have implications for treating other emerging viruses such as avian influenza bird flu 
the philadelphia results collaborated the findings of the hong kong study 
present production methods for vaccines involve the use of millions of chicken eggs and would be slow to respond to an outbreak according to various world health organization expert panels 
health officials are also concerned that bird flu could mutate to cause the next pandemic and render present vaccines under development ineffective 
we have initiated a collaboration with a research organization in the netherlands viroclinics to study the activity of alferon ldo against avian influenza in a primate model 
two toxicology studies have been completed at the lovelace clinic in albuquerque  new mexico to support new methods of ampligen administration 
these studies involved the use of ampligen as a vaccine immunostimulant 
we plan to conduct a study in australia to study the immunostimulant effect of ampligen on influenza vaccination in the elderly 
this study is expected to start in the second quarter of these important studies show that ampligen can be safely administered intranasally and intramucosally  as well as intravenously 
manufacturing historically  we have outsourced the manufacturing of ampligen to certain contractor facilities in the united states and south africa while maintaining full quality control and supervision of the process 
nucleic acid polymers constitute the raw material used in the production of ampligen 
we previously acquired our raw materials from ribotech  ltd 
ribotech located in south africa 
ribotech  is jointly owned by us and bioclones proprietary  ltd 

bioclones manages and operates ribotech 
there are a limited number of manufacturers in the united states available to provide the polymers 
at present  we do not have any agreements with third parties for the supply of any of such materials 
ribotech s facility in south africa  our previous supplier of raw materials  was determined not to be suitable for the commercial manufacture of polymers raw material used to make ampligen 
in response to this  we completed the set up of a polymer raw material manufacturing operation in in our new brunswick  nj facility 
the transfer of ampligen raw materials production to our own facilities has obvious advantages with respect to overall control of the manufacturing process  keeping costs down  controlling regulatory compliance issues and allows us to obtain ampligen raw materials on a more consistent manufacturing basis 
the first lot of ampligen raw material was produced in the second quarter of we have continued to produce ampligen raw material for the purpose of conducting pilot manufacturing runs at our contract manufacture of ampligen  hollister stier see below 
the total approximate cost of establishing this production line in and was  including modifications to our new brunswick facility 
we anticipate that this polymer production line will have the capacity to produce up to two kilograms per week  or approximately kilograms per year which should allow us to manufacture up to  mg doses per year 
we have also identified three contract manufacturers to expand polymer manufacture and obtained preliminary proposals from two and initiated discussions with the third 
this would provide a backup to our new jersey facility and additional production capacity  if necessary 
this transfer of polymer manufacturing to our own facilities  and or to another contract manufacturer may delay certain steps in commercialization process  specifically  our ampligen nda registration process now underway 
in the past  we distributed ampligen in the form of a freeze dried powder to be formulated by pharmacists at the site of use 
we perfected a production process to produce ready to use liquid ampligen in a dosage form  which will mainly be used upon commercial approval of ampligen 
we had engaged the services of schering plough schering to mass produce ready to use ampligen doses  however  in connection with settling various manufacturing infractions previously noted by the fda  schering entered into a consent decree with the fda whereby  among other things  it agreed to discontinue various contract third party manufacturing activities at various facilities including its san juan  puerto rico  plant 
ampligen which was not involved in any of the cited infractions was produced at this puerto rico plant from year operating under instructions from the consent decree  schering advised us that it would no longer manufacture ampligen in this facility beyond and assisted us in an orderly transfer of said activities to other non schering facilities 
on december   we executed a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington hollister stier  for the contract manufacturing of ampligen for a five year term 
pursuant to the agreement we will supply the key raw materials and hollister stier will formulate and bottle ampligen 
we executed a confidentiality agreement with hollister stier  in conjunction with the above supply agreement  and commenced the transfer of our manufacturing technology to hollister stier 
currently  hollister stier has completed five pilot manufacturing runs of ampligen for stability testing with one additional manufacturing run scheduled to be completed mid march the first three pilot runs were completed during the period december through january utilizing polymer raw material from ribotech our previous supplier of raw material 
the six month accelerated stability data on these three lots support a two year expiration period with additional test results forthcoming 
having successfully completed these manufacturing runs  the scale up of ampligen manufacturing to commercial batch size and the validation of the manufacturing at hollister stier was initiated 
the remaining two lots were run in january and february with the aforementioned third lot planned for mid march utilizing polymer raw material from our nj facility 
based on the available information from the completion of the first two commercial size manufacturing validation lots  we anticipate placing these three process validation lots in stability studies to monitor and confirm the product quality and stability 
alferon n injection  the purified drug concentrate utilized in the formulation of alferon n injection  was manufactured in our new brunswick  new jersey facility and was formulated and packaged at a production facility formerly owned and operated by abbott laboratories located in kansas 
abbott laboratories sold the facility to hospira 
hospira ceased the labeling and packaging of alferon n injection as they sought larger production runs for cost efficiency purposes 
on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient quantity and provide any pertinent information to the project 
hyaluron is in the process of preparing their facility to produce alferon n 
at this time we have scheduled additional production 
marketing distribution we continue our efforts to establish an internal marketing and sales infrastructure to facilitate and refine our commercialization initiatives 
in  we entered into a strategic alliance with accredo to develop certain marketing and distribution capacities for ampligen in the united states 
accredo is one of the nation s largest home health care companies with over offices and sixty thousand caregivers nationwide 
pursuant to the agreement  accredo assumed certain responsibilities for distribution of ampligen for which they received a fee 
through this arrangement  we may mitigate the necessity of incurring certain up front costs 
accredo has also worked with us in connection with the amp me cfs cost recovery treatment program  amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial and the amp combining ampligen with other antiviral drugs in hiv salvage therapy and amp hiv phase iib clinical trials now under way 
there can be no assurances that this alliance will develop a significant commercial position in any of its targeted chronic disease markets 
the agreement had an initial one year term from february  with successive additional one year terms unless either party notifies the other not less than days prior to the anniversary date of its intent to terminate the agreement 
also  the agreement may be terminated for uncured defaults  or bankruptcy  or insolvency of either party and will automatically terminate upon our receiving an nda for ampligen from the fda  at which time  a new agreement will need to be negotiated with accredo or another major drug distributor 
this agreement offers the potential to provide some marketing and distribution capacity in the united states 
our marketing strategy for ampligen reflects the differing health care systems around the world  and the different marketing and distribution systems that are used to supply pharmaceutical products to those systems 
in the us  we expect that  subject to receipt of regulatory approval  ampligen may be utilized in four medical arenas physicians offices  clinics  hospitals and the home treatment setting 
we are in the process of developing pre launch and launch driven marketing plans focusing on those audience development  medical support and payor reimbursement initiatives which will facilitate product acceptance and utilization at the time of regulatory approval 
similarly  we are developing distribution scenarios for the specialty pharmacy infusion channel which will insure market access  offer accounts receivable capabilities and provide the requisite risk management control mechanisms 
it is our intent to utilize third party service providers to execute elements of both the marketing sales and distribution plans 
we currently plan to utilize a small group of managed market account managers to introduce the product payor  employer and government account audiences 
we believe that this approach will establish a market presence and facilitate the generation of revenue without incurring the substantial costs associated with a traditional sales force 
furthermore  management believes that the approach will enable us to retain many options for future marketing strategies 
in europe  we plan to adopt a country by country and  in certain cases  an indication by indication marketing strategy due to the heterogeneity regulation and alternative distribution systems in these areas 
we also plan to adopt an indication by indication strategy in japan 
subject to receipt of regulatory approval  we plan to seek strategic partnering arrangements with pharmaceutical companies to facilitate introductions in these areas 
the relative prevalence of people from target indications for ampligen varies significantly by geographic region  and we intend to adjust our clinical and marketing planning to reflect the specialty of each area 
in spain  portugal and andorra we have entered into a sales distribution agreement with laboratorios del dr 
esteve  s 
a  a major pharmaceutical firm headquartered in spain 
plans to increase revenues of alferon n injection are intended to focus on direct  non personal selling efforts to targeted physician audiences 
it is our intent to promote alferon to those dermatologists  ob gyns and family practice ims who are involved in the treatment of patients with refractory or recurring external genital warts and who currently utilize both injectable interferons as well as topical therapeutic agents 
we also intend to expand our marketing sales programs on an international basis with our primary focus on europe 
this program is being designed to engage european pharmaceutical distributors to market and distribute alferon n injection 
competition our potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
these companies and their competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products 
in addition  conventional drug therapy  surgery and other more familiar treatments will offer competition to our products 
furthermore  our competitors have significantly greater experience than we do in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining fda  emea health protection branch hpb and other regulatory approvals of products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda  emea and hpb product approvals more rapidly than us 
if any of our products receive regulatory approvals and we commence commercial sales of our products  we will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities  areas in which we have no experience 
our competitors may possess or obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that prevent  limit or otherwise adversely affect our ability to develop or exploit our products 
the major competitors with drugs to treat hiv diseases include gilead pharmaceutical  pfizer  bristol myers  abbott labs  glaxo smithkline  merck and schering plough corp 
alferon n injection currently competes with a product produced by schering for treating genital warts 
m pharmaceutical also markets its immune response modifier product  aldera  for the treatment of genital and perianal warts 
we believe the approval and marketing of this product is the main reason that sales of alferon n injection have not met our expectations in the current year 
in november  the botanical drug  veregen to be marketed by bradley pharmaceuticals was also approved for the topical treatment of genital and perianal warts 
government regulation regulation by governmental authorities in the us and foreign countries is and will be a significant factor in the manufacture and marketing of alferon n products and our ongoing research and product development activities 
ampligen and the products developed from the ongoing research and product development activities will require regulatory clearances prior to commercialization 
in particular  new human drug products for humans are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing as a condition for clearance by the fda and by similar authorities in foreign countries 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals  and the ongoing process of compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  has required  and will continue to require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect the marketing of any products developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue 
we have received orphan drug designation for certain therapeutic indications  which might  under certain conditions  accelerate the process of drug commercialization 
alferon n injection is only approved for use in intra lesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older 
use of alferon n injection for other applications requires regulatory approval 
a fast track designation by the fda  while not affecting any clinical development time per se  has the potential effect of reducing the regulatory review time by fifty percent from the time that a commercial drug application is actually submitted for final regulatory review 
regulatory agencies may apply a fast track designation to a potential new drug to accelerate the approval and commercialization process 
criteria for fast track include a a devastating disease without adequate therapy and b laboratory or clinical evidence that the candidate drug may address the unmet medical need 
as of this date  we have not received a fast track designation for any of our potential therapeutic indications although we have received orphan drug designation for both me cfs and hiv aids in the us we continue to present data from time to time in support of obtaining some form of accelerated review 
we have not yet completed our nda filing for ampligen which is in process 
we are subject to various federal  state and local laws  regulations and recommendations relating to such matters as safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances  including radioactive compounds and infectious disease agents  used in connection with our research work 
the laboratory and production facility in new brunswick  new jersey  which we acquired from isi  is approved for the manufacture of alferon n injection and we believe it is in substantial compliance with all material regulations 
however  we cannot give assurances that facilities owned and operated by third parties that are utilized in the manufacture of our products  are in substantial compliance  or if presently in substantial compliance  will remain so 
research  consulting  licensing and supply agreements as previously discussed in item i  we acquired a series of patents on oragens  potentially a set of oral broad spectrum antivirals and immunological enhancers  through a licensing agreement with temple university in philadelphia  pa 
we were granted an exclusive worldwide license from temple for the oragens products 
these compounds have been evaluated in various academic laboratories for application to chronic viral and immunological disorders 
pursuant to the terms of our agreement with temple  we are obligated to pay royalties of to of sales depending on the amount of technical assistance required 
we currently pay a royalty of  per year to temple 
this agreement is to remain in effect until the date that the last licensed patent expires unless terminated sooner by mutual consent or default due to royalties not being paid 
the last oragen patent expires on june  we recorded the payment of the royalty as research and development cost for the period incurred 
in december  we entered into an agreement with biovail corporation international biovail 
biovail is an international full service pharmaceutical company engaged in the formulation  clinical testing  registration and manufacture of drug products utilizing advanced drug delivery systems 
biovail is headquartered in toronto  canada 
the agreement grants biovail the exclusive distributorship of our product in the canadian territories subject to certain terms and conditions 
in return  biovail agrees to conduct certain pre marketing clinical studies and market development programs  including without limitation  expansion of the emergency drug release program in canada with respect to our products 
in addition  biovail agrees to work with us in preparing and filing a new drug submission with canadian regulatory authorities at the appropriate time 
biovail invested  in hemispherx equity at prices above the then current market price and agreed to make an additional investment of  based on receiving approval to market ampligen in canada from the appropriate regulatory authorities in canada 
the agreement requires biovail to buy exclusively from us and penetrate certain market segments at specific rates in order to maintain market exclusivity 
the agreement terminates on december   subject to successive two year extensions by the parties and subject to earlier termination by the parties for uncured defaults under the agreement  bankruptcy or insolvency of either party  or withdrawal of our product from canada for a period of more than ninety days for serious adverse health or safety reasons 
in may  we acquired an interest in chronix biomedical corp 
chronix 
chronix focuses upon the development of diagnostics for chronic diseases 
we issued  shares of common stock to chronix toward a total equity investment of  pursuant to a strategic alliance agreement  we provided chronix with  for research and development in an effort to develop intellectual property on potential new products for diagnosing and treating various chronic illnesses such as me cfs 
these costs were expensed as incurred 
the strategic alliance agreement provides us certain royalty rights with respect to certain diagnostic technology developed from this research and a right of first refusal to license certain therapeutic technology developed from this research 
the strategic alliance agreement provides us with a royalty payment of of all net sales of diagnostic technology developed by chronix for diagnosing chronic fatigue syndrome  gulf war syndrome and human herpes virus associated diseases 
the royalty continues for the longer of years from september  or the life of any patent s issued with regard to the diagnostic technology 
the strategic alliance agreement also provides us with the right of first refusal to acquire an exclusive worldwide license for any and all therapeutic technology developed by chronix on or before september  for treating chronic fatigue syndrome  gulf war syndrome and human herpes virus associated diseases 
the carrying value of this investment as of december  was  to facilitate a financing undertaken by chronix biomedical  inc chronix on october  we terminated a shareholders agreement  investor rights agreement and a co sale agreement between us  chronix and certain chronix investors  each dated as of august  the chronix agreements 
as consideration for terminating the chronix agreements  we received  shares of restricted chronix common stock and entered into a voting agreement  investor rights agreement and co sale and right of first refusal agreement with chronix and certain chronix investors 
this transaction did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
the company did not assign a value for the receipt of these shares pursuant to this termination 
in march  our european subsidiary hemispherx sa entered into a sales and distribution agreement with esteve 
in december hemispherx sa assigned all of its rights and obligations under the sales and distribution agreement to us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  esteve was granted the exclusive right to market ampligen in spain  portugal and andorra for the treatment of me cfs 
in addition to other terms and other projected payments  esteve agreed to conduct certain clinical trials using ampligen in the patient population coinfected with hcv and hiv viruses 
the agreement runs for the longer of ten years from the date of first arms length sale in the territory  the expiration of the last hemispherx patent exploited by esteve or the period of regulatory data protection for ampligen in the applicable territory 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement esteve is to conduct clinical trials using ampligen to treat patients with both hcv and hiv and is required to purchase certain minimum annual amounts of ampligen following regulatory approval 
esteve initiated the hiv hcv clinical trials in spain in late  but did not proceed with the trials due to an inability to enroll a sufficient number of patients 
we are discussing with esteve their initiation of another clinical trial utilizing ampligen in another indication 
the agreement is terminable by either party if ampligen is withdrawn from the territory for a specified period due to serious adverse health or safety reasons  bankruptcy  insolvency or related issues of one of the parties  or material breach of the agreement 
hemispherx may transform the agreement into a non exclusive agreement or terminate the agreement in the event that esteve does not meet specified percentages of its annual minimum purchase requirements under the agreement 
esteve may terminate the agreement in the event that hemispherx fails to supply ampligen to the territory for a specified period of time or certain clinical trials being conducted by hemispherx are not successful 
the last patent with respect to this agreement expires on june  recently  japanese researchers journal of virology page  have found that dsrnas increase the effectiveness of influenza vaccine by more than and may also convey cross protection ability against variant viruses mutated strains of influenza virus 
in october  we signed a research agreement with the national institute of infectious diseases  in tokyo  japan 
the collaboration  by hideki hasegawa  md  md  chief of the laboratory of infectious disease pathology  will assess our experimental therapeutic ampligen as a co administered immunotherapeutic to the institution s nasal flu vaccine 
in october  we also engaged the sage group  inc  a health care  technology oriented  strategy and transaction advisory firm  to assist us in obtaining a strategic alliance in japan for the use of ampligen in treating chronic fatigue syndrome or cfs 
in the past year leaders in the japanese medical community have established the japanese society of the fatigue science and the osaka city university hospital opened the fatigue clinical center as the initial step in their fatigue research project 
we are in discussions with the sage group  inc to expand its engagement to assist us in obtaining a strategic alliance in japan for the use of ampligen in treating avian flu 
in november  we entered into an agreement with defence r d canada  suffield drdc suffield  an agency of the canadian department of national defence  to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of our experimental therapeutic ampligen and alferon for protection against human respiratory influenza virus infection in well validated animal models 
drdc suffield is conducting research and development of new drugs that could potentially become part of the arsenal of existing antiviral weapons to combat the bird flu 
the initial study will focus on the testing of potential drugs against the respiratory influenza virus infection on a mouse adapted strain of human influenza 
we entered into an agreement with paul griffin and the asclepius trust asclepius whereby we acquired the right  title and interest in certain awarded patents and pending patent applications patents 
consideration given by us for the acquisition of these patents amounted to  paid with shares of our common stock to paul griffin valued at the closing price on the date of the agreement or july  the value of our common stock was on this date and equated to consideration of  shares 
we registered these shares on behalf of mr 
griffin for public resale 
asclepius will receive in consideration a royalty of the gross sums received from all sales utilizing or relying upon the patents 
we recorded the acquisition of these patents as an intangible asset to be amortized over an average remaining life of years 
on july   we executed an agreement with stem cell innovations  inc formerly interferon sciences  inc 
whereby we acquired the royalty interest previously granted interferon sciences with respect to our sale of products containing alpha interferon in exchange for  shares of common stock 
we registered these shares on behalf of stem cell innovations for public resale 
the total consideration paid to stem cell under the agreement amounted to  and was derived by multiplying the number of shares issued by the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the agreement or per share 
the intangible asset is amortized over the period which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our cash flow 
the estimated aggregate amortization for the next five years is  and will be fully amortized in approximately ten years 
we have entered into agreements for consulting services  which are performed at medical research institutions and by medical and clinical research individuals 
our obligation to fund these agreements can be terminated after the initial funding period  which generally ranges from one to three years or on an as needed monthly basis 
during the year ending december   and we incurred approximately   and  respectively  of consulting service fees under these agreements 
these costs are charged to research and development expense as incurred 
as previously discussed in the manufacturing section of item i  we executed a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington hollister stier  for the contract manufacturing of ampligen for a five year term 
pursuant to the agreement we will supply the key raw materials and hollister stier will formulate and bottle the ampligen 
in november  we paid  as a deposit in order to initiate the manufacturing project 
this deposit was expensed as research and development during the th quarter as previously discussed in the manufacturing section of item i  on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient quantity and provide any pertinent information to the project 
the development of our nucleic acid based products requires the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time consuming research  preclinical development  and clinical trials that are necessary to bring pharmaceutical products to market and to establish commercial scale production and marketing capabilities 
during our last three fiscal years  we have directly spent approximately  in research and development  of which approximately  was expended in the year ended december  these direct costs do not include the overhead and administrative costs necessary to support the research and development effort 
human resources as of march   we had personnel consisting of full time employees  regulatory research medical personnel on a part time basis 
part time personnel are paid on a per diem or monthly basis 
personnel are engaged in our research  development  clinical  and manufacturing effort 
of our personnel perform regulatory  general administration  data processing  including bio statistics  financial and investor relations functions 
we have no union employees and we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
while we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced scientific personnel  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract or retain the necessary qualified employees and or consultants in the future 
scientific advisory board our scientific advisory board consists of individuals who we believe have particular scientific and medical expertise in virology  cancer  immunology  biochemistry and related fields 
these individuals will advise us about current and long term scientific planning including research and development 
the scientific advisory board will hold periodic meetings as needed by the clinical studies in progress by us 
no scientific advisory board meetings were held in in addition  individual scientific advisory board members sometimes consult with  and meet informally with our employees 
all members of the scientific advisory are employed by others and may have commitments to and or consulting agreements with other entities  including our potential competitors 
members of the scientific advisory board are compensated at the rate of  per meeting attended or per day devoted to our affairs 
item a 
risk factors 
the following cautionary statements identify important factors that could cause our actual result to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements made in this form k 
among the key factors that have a direct bearing on our results of operations are risks associated with our business no assurance of successful product development ampligen and related products 
the development of ampligen and our other related products is subject to a number of significant risks 
ampligen may be found to be ineffective or to have adverse side effects  fail to receive necessary regulatory clearances  be difficult to manufacture on a commercial scale  be uneconomical to market or be precluded from commercialization by proprietary right of third parties 
our products are in various stages of clinical and pre clinical development and  require further clinical studies and appropriate regulatory approval processes before any such products can be marketed 
we do not know when  if ever  ampligen or our other products will be generally available for commercial sale for any indication 
generally  only a small percentage of potential therapeutic products are eventually approved by the fda for commercial sale 
we are in the registration process for an nda with the fda for approval to use ampligen in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome 
we can provide no guidance as to the tentative date at which the compilation and filing of the nda will be complete  as significant factors are outside our control including  without limitation  the ability and willingness of the independent clinical investigators to complete the requisite reports at an acceptable regulatory standard  the ability to collect overseas generated data  and the ability of hollister stier facilities to interface with our own new brunswick staff facilities to meet the manufacturing regulatory standards 
also  the timing of the fda review process of the nda is subject to the control of the fda and could result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen for use in treating me cfs patients require more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our nda application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen 
alferon n injection 
although alferon n injection is approved for marketing in the united states for the intra lesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older  to date it has not been approved for other indications 
we face many of the risks discussed above  with regard to developing this product for use to treat other ailments such as multiple sclerosis and cancer 
our drug and related technologies are investigational and subject to regulatory approval 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval  our operations will be significantly affected 
all of our drugs and associated technologies  other than alferon n injection  are investigational and must receive prior regulatory approval by appropriate regulatory authorities for general use and are currently legally available only through clinical trials with specified disorders 
at present  alferon n injection is only approved for the intra lesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in patients years of age or older 
use of alferon n injection for other indications will require regulatory approval 
in this regard  isi  the company from which we obtained our rights to alferon n injection  conducted clinical trials related to use of alferon n injection for treatment of hiv and hepatitis c 
in both instances  the fda determined that additional studies were necessary in order to fully evaluate the efficacy of alferon n injection in the treatment of hiv and hepatitis c diseases 
we have no immediate plans to conduct these additional studies at this time 
our products  including ampligen  are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the us and other countries  including  but not limited to  the fda in the us  the health protection branch hpb of canada  and the agency for the evaluation of medicinal products emea in europe 
obtaining regulatory approvals is a rigorous and lengthy process and requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
in order to obtain final regulatory approval of a new drug  we must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory agency that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product to the applicable regulatory standards 
we require regulatory approval in order to market ampligen or any other proposed product and receive product revenues or royalties 
we cannot assure you that ampligen will ultimately be demonstrated to be safe or efficacious 
in addition  while ampligen is authorized for use in clinical trials in the united states  we cannot assure you that additional clinical trial approvals will be authorized in the united states or in other countries  in a timely fashion or at all  or that we will complete these clinical trials 
if ampligen or one of our other products does not receive regulatory approval in the us or elsewhere  our operations most likely will be materially adversely affected 
although preliminary in vitro testing indicates that ampligen enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian influenza  preliminary testing in the laboratory is not necessarily predictive of successful results in clinical testing or human treatment 
ampligen is undergoing pre clinical testing for possible treatment of avian flu 
although preliminary in vitro testing indicates that ampligen enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian flu  preliminary testing in the laboratory is not necessarily predictive of successful results in clinical testing or human treatment 
no assurance can be given that similar results will be observed in clinical trials 
use of ampligen in the treatment of avian flu requires prior regulatory approval 
only the fda can determine whether a drug is safe  effective or promising for treating a specific application 
as discussed in the prior risk factor  obtaining regulatory approvals is a rigorous and lengthy process 
in addition  ampligen is being tested on two strains of avian flu 
there are a number of strains and strains mutate 
no assurance can be given that ampligen will be effective on any strains that might infect humans 
we may continue to incur substantial losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
we began operations in and last reported net profit from through since  we have incurred substantial operating losses  as we pursued our clinical trial effort to get our experimental drug  ampligen  approved 
as of december  our accumulated deficit was approximately  we have not yet generated significant revenues from our products and may incur substantial and increased losses in the future 
we cannot assure that we will ever achieve significant revenues from product sales or become profitable 
we require  and will continue to require  the commitment of substantial resources to develop our products 
we cannot assure that our product development efforts will be successfully completed or that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that any products will be manufactured and marketed successfully  or be profitable 
we may require additional financing which may not be available 
the development of our products will require the commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time consuming research  preclinical development  and clinical trials that are necessary to bring pharmaceutical products to market 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
these funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements  including debt service  for at least the next months 
on april   we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with fusion capital fund ii  llc  pursuant to which fusion capital has agreed  under certain conditions and with certain limitations  to purchase on each trading day  of our common stock up to an aggregate of  over a month period 
see part i  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
we only have the right to receive  per trading day under the agreement with fusion capital unless our stock price exceeds by at least  in which case the daily amount may be increased under certain conditions as the price of our common stock increases 
fusion capital shall not have the right nor the obligation to purchase any shares of our common stock on any trading days that the market price of our common stock is less than 
we have registered  shares purchasable by fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement inclusive of up to  additional commitment shares  the selling price of our common stock to fusion capital will have to average at least about per share for us to receive the maximum proceeds of  without registering additional shares of common stock 
as of march   fusion capital has purchased  shares for proceeds of  assuming a purchase price of per share the closing sale price of the common stock on march  and the purchase by fusion capital of the remaining  shares which excludes up to  commitment shares under the common stock purchase agreement  proceeds to us would only be  we are planning to register an additional  shares which  if sold pursuant to this agreement would produce additional funds in order to be in compliance with the american stock exchange rules  our stockholders on september  approved the issuance of up to  shares to accommodate this agreement  if needed 
in addition  fusion capital cannot purchase more than  shares  inclusive of commitment shares under the common stock purchase agreement 
accordingly  depending upon the future market price of our common stock  we may realize less than the maximum  proceeds from the sale of stock under the purchase agreement 
the extent to which we rely on fusion capital as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors including  the prevailing market price of our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure working capital from other sources 
if obtaining sufficient financing from fusion capital were to prove unavailable or prohibitively dilutive and if we are unable to commercialize and sell ampligen and or increase sales of alferon n injection or our other products  we will need to secure another source of funding in order to satisfy our working capital needs 
even if we are able to access the full  under the common stock purchase agreement with fusion capital  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
also  we have the ability to curtail discretionary spending  including some research and development activities  if required to conserve cash 
we may not be profitable unless we can protect our patents and or receive approval for additional pending patents 
we need to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering the use of ampligen for a particular disease in order to obtain exclusive rights for the commercial sale of ampligen for such disease 
we obtained all rights to alferon n injection  and we plan to preserve and acquire enforceable patents covering its use for existing and potentially new diseases 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to preserve and obtain patent protection for our products and to obtain and preserve our trade secrets and expertise 
certain of our know how and technology is not patentable  particularly the procedures for the manufacture of our drug product which are carried out according to standard operating procedure manuals 
we have been issued certain patents including those on the use of ampligen and ampligen in combination with certain other drugs for the treatment of hiv 
we also have been issued patents on the use of ampligen in combination with certain other drugs for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b virus  chronic hepatitis c virus  and a patent which affords protection on the use of ampligen in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome 
we have not yet been issued any patents in the united states for the use of ampligen as a sole treatment for any of the cancers  which we have sought to target 
with regard to alferon n injection  we have acquired from isi its patents for natural alpha interferon produced from human peripheral blood leukocytes and its production process and we have filed a patent application for the use of alferon ldo in treating viral diseases including avian influenza 
we cannot assure that our competitors will not seek and obtain patents regarding the use of similar products in combination with various other agents  for a particular target indication prior to our doing such 
if we cannot protect our patents covering the use of our products for a particular disease  or obtain additional patents  we may not be able to successfully market our products 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of protection afforded by pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents 
there can be no assurance that new patent applications relating to our products or technology will result in patents being issued or that  if issued  such patents will afford meaningful protection against competitors with similar technology 
it is generally anticipated that there may be significant litigation in the industry regarding patent and intellectual property rights 
such litigation could require substantial resources from us and we may not have the financial resources necessary to enforce the patent rights that we hold 
no assurance can be made that our patents will provide competitive advantages for our products or will not be successfully challenged by competitors 
no assurance can be given that patents do not exist or could not be filed which would have a materially adverse effect on our ability to develop or market our products or to obtain or maintain any competitive position that we may achieve with respect to our products 
our patents also may not prevent others from developing competitive products using related technology 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary licenses if we cannot enforce patent rights we may hold 
in addition  the failure of third parties from whom we currently license certain proprietary information or from whom we may be required to obtain such licenses in the future  to adequately enforce their rights to such proprietary information  could adversely affect the value of such licenses to us 
if we cannot enforce the patent rights we currently hold we may be required to obtain licenses from others to develop  manufacture or market our products 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain any such licenses on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we currently license certain proprietary information from third parties  some of which may have been developed with government grants under circumstances where the government maintained certain rights with respect to the proprietary information developed 
no assurances can be given that such third parties will adequately enforce any rights they may have or that the rights  if any  retained by the government will not adversely affect the value of our license 
there is no guarantee that our trade secrets will not be disclosed or known by our competitors 
to protect our rights  we require certain employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements with us 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate and enforceable remedies for any breach  or that any trade secrets of ours will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
if our distributors do not market our products successfully  we may not generate significant revenues or become profitable 
we have limited marketing and sales capability 
we are dependent upon existing and  possibly future  marketing agreements and third party distribution agreements for our prod ucts in order to generate significant revenues and become profitable 
as a result  any revenues received by us will be dependent on the efforts of third parties  and there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
our agreement with accredo offers potential to provide some marketing and distribution capacity in the united states while agreements with biovail corporation and laboratorios del dr 
esteve sa may provide a sales force in canada  spain and portugal 
we cannot assure that our united states or foreign marketing partners will be able to successfully distribute our products  or that we will be able to establish future marketing or third party distribution agreements on terms acceptable to us  or that the cost of establishing these arrangements will not exceed any product revenues 
the failure to continue these arrangements or to achieve other such arrangements on satisfactory terms could have a materially adverse effect on us 
there are no long term agreements with suppliers of required materials 
if we are unable to obtain the required raw materials  we may be required to scale back our operations or stop manufacturing alferon n injection and or ampligen 
a number of essential materials are used in the production of alferon n injection  including human white blood cells 
we do not have long term agreements for the supply of any of such materials 
there can be no assurance we can enter into long term supply agreements covering essential materials on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
there are a limited number of manufacturers in the united states available to provide the polymers for use in manufacturing ampligen 
at present  we do not have any agreements with third parties for the supply of any of these polymers 
we have established relevant manufacturing operations within our new brunswick  new jersey facility for the production of ampligen raw materials in order to obtain polymers on a more consistent manufacturing basis 
the establishment of an ampligen raw materials production line within our own facilities  while having obvious advantages with respect to regulatory compliance other parts of our  sq 
ft 
wholly owned fda approved facility are already in compliance for the manufacture of alferon n injection  may delay certain steps in the commercialization process  specifically our ampligen nda registration process with the fda 
if we are unable to obtain or manufacture the required raw materials  we may be required to scale back our operations or stop manufacturing 
the costs and availability of products and materials we need for the production of ampligen and the commercial production of alferon n injection and other products which we may commercially produce are subject to fluctuation depending on a variety of factors beyond our control  including competitive factors  changes in technology  and fda and other governmental regulations and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such products and materials on terms acceptable to us or at all 
there is no assurance that successful manufacture of a drug on a limited scale basis for investigational use will lead to a successful transition to commercial  large scale production 
small changes in methods of manufacturing  including commercial scale up  may affect the chemical structure of ampligen and other rna drugs  as well as their safety and efficacy  and can  among other things  require new clinical studies and affect orphan drug status  particularly  market exclusivity rights  if any  under the orphan drug act 
the transition from limited production of pre clinical and clinical research quantities to production of commercial quantities of our products will involve distinct management and technical challenges and will require additional management and technical personnel and capital to the extent such manufacturing is not handled by third parties 
there can be no assurance that our manufacturing will be successful or that any given product will be determined to be safe and effective  capable of being manufactured economically in commercial quantities or successfully marketed 
we have limited manufacturing experience and capacity 
ampligen has been only produced in limited quantities for use in our clinical trials and we are dependent upon third party suppliers for substantially all of the production process 
the failure to continue these arrangements or to achieve other such arrangements on satisfactory terms could have a material adverse affect on us 
also  to be successful  our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at acceptable costs 
to the extent we are involved in the production process  our current facilities are not adequate for the production of our proposed products for large scale commercialization  and we currently do not have adequate personnel to conduct commercial scale manufacturing 
we intend to utilize third party facilities if and when the need arises or  if we are unable to do so  to build or acquire commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
we will need to comply with regulatory requirements for such facilities  including those of the fda pertaining to current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations 
there can be no assurance that such facilities can be used  built  or acquired on commercially acceptable terms  or that such facilities  if used  built  or acquired  will be adequate for our long term needs 
we may not be profitable unless we can produce ampligen or other products in commercial quantities at costs acceptable to us 
we have never produced ampligen or any other products in large commercial quantities 
we must manufacture our products in compliance with regulatory requirements in large commercial quantities and at acceptable costs in order for us to be profitable 
we intend to utilize third party manufacturers and or facilities if and when the need arises or  if we are unable to do so  to build or acquire commercial scale manufacturing facili ties 
if we cannot manufacture commercial quantities of ampligen or enter into third party agreements for its manufacture at costs acceptable to us  our operations will be significantly affected 
also  each production lot of alferon n injection is subject to fda review and approval prior to releasing the lots to be sold 
this review and approval process could take considerable time  which would delay our having product in inventory to sell 
rapid technological change may render our products obsolete or non competitive 
the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are subject to rapid and substantial technological change 
technological competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  universities  governmental entities and others diversifying into the field is intense and is expected to increase 
most of these entities have significantly greater research and development capabilities than us  as well as substantial marketing  financial and managerial resources  and represent significant competition for us 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive or that we will be able to keep pace with technological developments 
our products may be subject to substantial competition 
ampligen 
competitors may be developing technologies that are  or in the future may be  the basis for competitive products 
some of these potential products may have an entirely different approach or means of accomplishing similar therapeutic effects to products being developed by us 
these competing products may be more effective and less costly than our products 
in addition  conventional drug therapy  surgery and other more familiar treatments may offer competition to our products 
furthermore  many of our competitors have significantly greater experience than us in pre clinical testing and human clinical trials of pharmaceutical products and in obtaining fda  hpb and other regulatory approvals of products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in obtaining fda  hpb or other regulatory product approvals more rapidly than us 
there are no drugs approved for commercial sale with respect to treating me cfs in the united states 
the dominant competitors with drugs to treat hiv diseases include gilead pharmaceutical  pfizer  bristol myers  abbott labs  glaxo smith kline  merck and schering plough corp 
these potential competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
although we believe our principal advantage is the unique mechanism of action of ampligen on the immune system  we cannot assure that we will be able to compete 
alferon n injection 
many competitors are among the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world  are well known to the public and the medical community  and have substantially greater financial resources  product development  and manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we have 
alferon n injection currently competes with schering s injectable recombinant alpha interferon product intron a for the treatment of genital warts 
m pharmaceuticals also received fda approval for its immune response modifier  aldara  a self administered topical cream  for the treatment of external genital and perianal warts 
in addition  medigene recently received fda approval for a self administered ointment  veregen tm  which is indicated for the topical treatment of external genital and perianal warts 
alferon n injection also competes with surgical  chemical  and other methods of treating genital warts 
we cannot assess the impact products developed by our competitors  or advances in other methods of the treatment of genital warts  will have on the commercial viability of alferon n injection 
if and when we obtain additional approvals of uses of this product  we expect to compete primarily on the basis of product performance 
our competitors have developed or may develop products containing either alpha or beta interferon or other therapeutic compounds or other treatment modalities for those uses 
in the united states  three recombinant forms of beta interferon have been approved for the treatment of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
there can be no assurance that  if we are able to obtain regulatory approval of alferon n injection for the treatment of new indications  we will be able to achieve any significant penetration into those markets 
in addition  because certain competitive products are not dependent on a source of human blood cells  such products may be able to be produced in greater volume and at a lower cost than alferon n injection 
currently  our wholesale price on a per unit basis of alferon n injection is higher than that of the competitive recombinant alpha and beta interferon products 
general 
other companies may succeed in developing products earlier than we do  obtaining approvals for such products from the fda more rapidly than we do  or developing products that are more effective than those we may develop 
while we will attempt to expand our technological capabilities in order to remain competitive  there can be no assurance that research and development by others or other medical advances will not render our technology or products obsolete or non competitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapy we develop 
possible side effects from the use of ampligen or alferon n injection could adversely affect potential revenues and physician patient acceptability of our product 
ampligen 
we believe that ampligen has been generally well tolerated with a low incidence of clinical toxicity  particularly given the severely debilitating or life threatening diseases that have been treated 
a mild flushing reaction has been observed in approximately of patients treated in our various studies 
this reaction is occasionally accompanied by a rapid heart beat  a tightness of the chest  urticaria swelling of the skin  anxiety  shortness of breath  subjective reports of feeling hot  sweating and nausea 
the reaction is usually infusion rate related and can generally be controlled by slowing the infusion rate 
other adverse side effects include liver enzyme level elevations  diarrhea  itching  asthma  low blood pressure  photophobia  rash  transient visual disturbances  slow or irregular heart rate  decreases in platelets and white blood cell counts  anemia  dizziness  confusion  elevation of kidney function tests  occasional temporary hair loss and various flu like symptoms  including fever  chills  fatigue  muscular aches  joint pains  headaches  nausea and vomiting 
these flu like side effects typically subside within several months 
one or more of the potential side effects might deter usage of ampligen in certain clinical situations and therefore  could adversely affect potential revenues and physician patient acceptability of our product 
alferon n injection 
at present  alferon n injection is only approved for the intra lesional within the lesion treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts in adults 
in clinical trials conducted for the treatment of genital warts with alferon n injection  patients did not experience serious side effects  however  there can be no assurance that unexpected or unacceptable side effects will not be found in the future for this use or other potential uses of alferon n injection which could threaten or limit such product s usefulness 
we may be subject to product liability claims from the use of ampligen  alferon n injection  or other of our products which could negatively affect our future operations 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of ampligen or other of our products results in adverse effects 
this liability might result from claims made directly by patients  hospitals  clinics or other consumers  or by pharmaceutical companies or others manufacturing these products on our behalf 
our future operations may be negatively affected from the litigation costs  settlement expenses and lost product sales inherent to these claims 
while we will continue to attempt to take appro priate precautions  we cannot assure that we will avoid significant product liability exposure 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that this insurance will provide adequate coverage against ampligen and or alferon n injection product liability claims 
a successful product liability claim against us in excess of ampligen s  in insurance coverage   in aggregate  or in excess of alferon n injection s  in insurance coverage   in aggregate  or for which coverage is not provided could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition 
the loss of dr 
william a 
carter s services could hurt our chances for success 
our success is dependent on the continued efforts of dr 
william a 
carter because of his position as a pioneer in the field of nucleic acid drugs  his being the co inventor of ampligen  and his knowledge of our overall activities  including patents and clinical trials 
the loss of dr 
carter s services could have a material adverse effect on our operations and chances for success 
we have secured key man life insurance in the amount of  on the life of dr 
carter and we have an employment agreement with dr 
carter that  as amended  runs until december  however  dr 
carter has the right to terminate his employment upon not less than days prior written notice 
the loss of dr 
carter or other personnel  or the failure to recruit additional personnel as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to achieve our objectives 
uncertainty of health care reimbursement for our products 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of such products and related treatment will be available from government health administration authorities  private health coverage insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products  and from time to time legislation is proposed  which  if adopted  could further restrict the prices charged by and or amounts reimbursable to manufacturers of pharmaceutical products 
we cannot predict what  if any  legislation will ultimately be adopted or the impact of such legislation on us 
there can be no assurance that third party insurance companies will allow us to charge and receive payments for products sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
there are risks of liabilities associated with handling and disposing of hazardous materials 
our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  carcinogenic chemicals  flammable solvents and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply in all material respects with the standards prescribed by applicable regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident or the failure to comply with applicable regulations  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could be significant 
we do not maintain insurance coverage against such liabilities 
the market price of our stock may be adversely affected by market volatility 
the market price of our common stock has been and is likely to be volatile 
in addition to general economic  political and market conditions  the price and trading volume of our stock could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including announcements of the results of clinical trials by us or our competitors  adverse reactions to products  governmental approvals  delays in expected governmental approvals or withdrawals of any prior governmental approvals or public or regulatory agency concerns regarding the safety or effectiveness of our products  changes in us or foreign regulatory policy during the period of product development  developments in patent or other proprietary rights  including any third party challenges of our intellectual property rights  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  announcements of new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  actual or anticipated variations in our operating results due to the level of development expenses and other factors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts and whether our earnings meet or exceed the estimates  conditions and trends in the pharmaceutical and other industries  new accounting standards  and the occurrence of any of the risks described in these risk factors 
our common stock is listed for quotation on the american stock exchange 
for the month period ended december   the closing price of our common stock has ranged from to per share 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile 
the average daily trading volume of our common stock varies significantly 
our relatively low average volume and low average number of transactions per day may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their shares in the public market at prevailing prices and a more active market may never develop 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of the securities of companies in our industry  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies in our industry 
if we face securities litigation in the future  even if without merit or unsuccessful  it would result in substantial costs and a diversion of management attention and resources  which would negatively impact our business 
our stock price may be adversely affected if a significant amount of shares are sold in the public market 
we have registered  shares for sale by fusion capital and  shares by others  and may  in the future  register additional shares for sale by fusion under the common stock purchase agreement 
as of march   approximately  shares of our common stock  constituted restricted securities as defined in rule under the securities act   of which have been registered in prior registration statements 
also  we have registered  shares issuable i upon conversion of approximately of debentures that we issued in and  ii as payment of of the interest on all of the debentures  iii upon exercise of of certain warrants  and iv upon exercise of certain other warrants 
registration of the shares permits the sale of the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions without compliance with the requirements of rule to the extent the exercise price of the warrants is less than the market price of the common stock  the holders of the warrants are likely to exercise them and sell the underlying shares of common stock and to the extent that the conversion price and exercise price of these securities are adjusted pursuant to anti dilution protection  the securities could be exercisable or convertible for even more shares of common stock 
we also may issue shares to be used to meet our capital requirements or use shares to compensate employees  consultants and or directors 
we are unable to estimate the amount  timing or nature of future sales of outstanding common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decrease 
furthermore  a decline in the price of our common stock would likely impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional shares of common stock or other equity securities 
the sale of our common stock to fusion capital may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by fusion capital and other shares registered for selling stockholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
the sale by fusion capital and other selling stockholders of our common stock will increase the number of our publicly traded shares  which could depress the market price of our common stock 
moreover  the mere prospect of resales by fusion capital and other selling stockholders as contemplated in this prospectus could depress the market price for our common stock 
the issuance of shares to fusion capital under the common stock purchase agreement  will dilute the equity interest of existing stockholders and could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
the purchase price for the common stock to be sold to fusion capital pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock 
all shares sold to fusion capital are to be freely tradable 
fusion capital may sell none  some or all of the shares of common stock purchased from us at any time 
we expect that the shares offered by this prospectus will be sold over a period of in excess of months 
depending upon market liquidity at the time  a sale of shares under this offering at any given time could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to fusion capital pursuant to the purchase agreement  or anticipation of such sales  could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law could defer a change of our management which could discourage or delay offers to acquire us 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us or for our stockholders to remove existing management  and might discourage a third party from offering to acquire us  even if a change in control or in management would be beneficial to our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation allows us to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue preferred stock without further stockholder approval 
as a result  our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation  the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares  together with a premium  prior to the redemption of our common stock 
in this regard  in november  we adopted a stockholder rights plan and  under the plan  our board of directors declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on november  each right initially entitles holders to buy one unit of preferred stock for 
the rights generally are not transferable apart from the common stock and will not be exercisable unless and until a person or group acquires or commences a tender or exchange offer to acquire  beneficial ownership of or more of our common stock 
however  for dr 
carter  our chief executive officer  who already beneficially owns of our common stock  the plan s threshold will be  instead of 
the rights will expire on november   and may be redeemed prior thereto at 
per right under certain circumstances 
because the risk factors referred to above could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements 
further  any forward looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement or statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict which will arise 
in addition  we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements 
our research in clinical efforts may continue for the next several years and we may continue to incur losses due to clinical costs incurred in the development of ampligen for commercial application 
possible losses may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of significant expenses incurred and receipt of licensing fees and or cost recovery treatment revenues in europe  canada and in the united states

item legal proceedings 
on september   we filed a multi count complaint against manuel p 
asensio  asensio company  inc asensio 
the action included claims of defamation  disparagement  tortuous interference with existing and prospective business relations and conspiracy  arising out of asensio s false and defamatory statements 
the complaint further alleged that asensio defamed and disparaged us in furtherance of a manipulative  deceptive and unlawful short selling scheme in august and september  in  asensio filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that in response to asensio s strong sell recommendation and other press releases  we made defamatory statements about asensio 
we denied the material allegations of the counterclaim 
in july  following dismissal in federal court for lack of subject matter jurisdiction  we transferred the action to the pennsylvania state court 
in march  the defendants responded to the complaints as amended and a trial commenced on january  a jury verdict disallowed the claims against the defendants for defamation and disparagement and the court granted us a directed verdict on the counterclaim 
on july  the court entered an order granting us a new trial against asensio for defamation and disparagement 
thereafter  asensio appealed the granting of a new trial to the superior court of pennsylvania 
the superior court of pennsylvania has denied asensio s appeal 
asensio petitioned the supreme court of pennsylvania for allowance of an appeal  which was denied 
we now anticipate the scheduling of a new trial against asensio for defamation and disparagement in the philadelphia common pleas court

was dissolved as of december results of operations years ended december  vs 
net loss our net loss of  for the year ended december  was up  or compared to the same period in this increase in loss was primarily due to higher general and administrative g a expense of  related primarily to the adoption of fas r amounting to higher stock compensation expense of  and higher accounting fees mainly related to the restatement of our financial statements of  higher research and development costs of  due to an increase in direct costs associated with developing ampligen and alferon n injection for new and existing indications and costs associated with stability studies for ampligen and alferon n injection related to manufacturing at our new contract manufacturer s sites  hollister stier and hyaluron  and higher production costs of approximately  is primarily due to excess manufacturing capacity 
offsetting these increased expenditures  was a net decrease in our interest expense and financing costs of approximately  as the amortization of the discounts on our convertible debentures has been decreasing as they near maturity 
net losses per share were 
for current period versus 
for the same period revenues revenues for the years ended december  were  as compared to revenues of  for the same period in ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program was up  or and alferon n injection sales were down  or 
the decline in alferon n injection sales can be attributed to increased competition from rival products 
ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
this program has been in effect for several years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
we are altering our marketing strategy for alferon n injection 
we plan to establish an internal marketing and sales department to facilitate and refine our commercialization initiatives 
production costs cost of goods sold our costs for production cost of goods sold increased  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was primarily due to higher production costs representing excess production capacity during the current period amounting to  cost of goods sold for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
during  hyaluron conducted three production runs for stability testing of alferon n injection s new vial material 
the stability test results at the six month check point met the required specifications 
the stability and validation testing of the new vials was successfully completed by year end we purchased the royalty interest related to the sales of our natural alpha interferon products from stem cell innovations  inc previously known as interferon sciences  inc 
in march  we acquired the fda approved manufacturing facility in new brunswick  nj and the worldwide license for the production  manufacture  use  marketing and sale of alferon n injection 
the royalty interest on the interferon products was a residual of this transaction 
we outsource certain components of our overall research and development  manufacturing  marketing and distribution while maintaining control over the entire process through our quality assurance group and our clinical monitoring group 
research and development costs overall research and development costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period a year ago representing an increase of  or 
the higher costs reflect an increase in the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen  as a therapy in treating acute and chronic diseases  cancers and on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv and pre clinical and clinical testing for possible treatment for avian and seasonal influenza viruses 
also  incremental costs were incurred for development of alternative delivery routes for alferon n more suitable for various biodefense treatment indications 
much of this increase in r d cost is related to the production of raw materials at our new production lines recently installed at our new brunswick facility 
the new brunswick facility successfully produced three lots of poly i and three lots of poly c 
u  which have been shipped to hollister stier our contract manufacturer for use in producing ampligen doses 
the initial five production lots produced by hollister stier are being used for validity and stability testing and are presently considered of commercial quality 
the results of these tests will be used in our ampligen nda submission 
we continue to focus our research and development efforts on three areas that have potential for commercialization the preparation of a new drug application nda for our experimental drug  ampligen  for the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome cfs 
cfs is a severe chronic disease that does not have recognized treatment therapy and is considered a serious and debilitating disease by the us government  adversely affecting the us economy by s of billions of dollars 
the formulation of a broad spectrum biodefense strategy built on the use of our experimental compounds consisting of ampligen and alferon ldo low dose oral 
the initial phase of this program is focused on the treatment of avian and seasonal flu and is being expanded to include other life threatening viruses 
the use of ampligen as a broad based vaccine enhancement compound 
the validation of suggestions that alferon n injection  already approved for treating hpv related genital warts  my have application in treating vulvar vestibulitis syndrome vvs  an hpv related disorder affecting more than of the adult us female population 
ampligen nda we continue our efforts with respect to completing the registration process for an nda with the food and drug administration fda for using ampligen to treat patients afflicted with chronic fatigue syndrome cfs 
cfs is a severe debilitating disease in which patients suffer complex symptoms such as fatigue  flu like ailments  headaches and muscle pain 
at this time  there are no approved treatment therapies 
the center for disease control cdc has added cfs to its priority list of emerging diseases 
the preparation of the nda is a time consuming and laborious process and basically involves the preparation of multiple technical documents including those covering safety data results from animal and humans exposed to ampligen  the data collection and analysis of data from several human clinical trials providing insight into the efficacy of ampligen and the capacity and ability to produce ampligen on a consistent basis in commercial quantities 
we have hired experienced technical teams assigned to preparing each of these three segments 
when completed  these three technical documents will be consolidated into the common technical document ctd for submitting to the fda 
while the results of our amp phase iii clinical study is the basis for filing the nda  we must also include the safety data collected on all patients that ever received ampligen some patients from clinical trials and various foreign countries for me cfs  plus hundreds of additional patients with hiv  hepatitis  cancer  etc 
all of this effort is time consuming as our clinical monitors and research assistants must visit and audit the records of clinical investigators involved in our ampligen clinical studies conducted over the last years 
the fda has recently invited us to submit a proposed schedule for completing our nda submission 
we believe our me cfs studies are now complete 
meanwhile  we continue with our existing ongoing efforts to insure a complete and audited report of our various studies  including the well controlled amp  c  and t studies 
we have used our best efforts to complete the requisite reports including the hiring of additional staff and various expert medical regulatory consultants with specific fields of expertise  many of which have held senior positions in various multi national pharmaceutical companies  but can provide no assurance as to whether the outcome of this large data collection and filing process will be favorable or unfavorable  specifically with respect to the fda s perspective 
the nda is being filed electronically to facilitate the ease of review by the fda 
we cannot yet provide guidance as to the tentative date at which the compilation and filing of the nda will be complete  as significant factors are outside our control including  without limitation  the ability and willingness of the independent clinical investigators to complete the requisite reports at an acceptable regulatory standard  the ability to collect overseas generated data  and the ability of hollister stier facilities to interface with our own new brunswick staff facilities to meet the manufacturing regulatory standards 
however  the overall process is proceeding 
we started the nda registration process on december  with the filing of one of the three major required sections 
the timing of the fda review process of the nda is subject to the control of the fda and could result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen for use in treating me cfs patients  require more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our nda application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen 
biodefense the disturbing threats of an influenza pandemic and or bioterror attacks have caused researchers and government institutions to pursue creative alternatives to existing vaccines and antivirals 
this pursuit has lead to growing recognition of our scientific approach and product portfolio 
medical researchers and clinical investigators  with whom we are collaborating  are utilizing our products in ongoing pre clinical tests in this viral area 
ampligen is a nucleic acid based molecule with potent immune stimulatory activity and we believe that it has the potential to safely enhance the effectiveness of various vaccines 
alferon ldo is a new experimental drug delivery platform for our natural source alpha interferon 
preclinical results indicate that alferon ldo has systemic biological activity on upregulation of interferon related genes 
potential applications include respiratory infections including influenza 
with the threat of an avian influenza pandemic rising and health officials warning that the virus could develop resistance to current flu treatments  the pursuit of a cost effective and capable co administered immunotherapeutic to existing antivirals and vaccines has become critical 
this combination may permit the use of lower dosages and fewer injections of the antivirals and vaccines used to combat avian flu  thereby decreasing the cost of both immunization programs and treatment programs for the full blown disease and increasing vaccine effectiveness 
in antimicrobial antibacterial therapy  which is the best studied clinical model  synergistic drug combinations may result in curative conditions outcomes  often not observed when the single drugs are given alone 
in the case of avian influenza where global drug supplies are presumptively in very limited supply relative to potential needs  therapeutic synergistic combinations could not only affect the disease outcome  but also the number of individuals able to access therapies 
the results of on going preclinical studies indicate that the activity of tamiflu and relenza  the only two drugs formally recognized for combating bird flu  can be boosted up to times when co administered with ampligen 
lab studies reveal that to times less tamiflu may be used in conjunction with ampligen to achieve full inhibition with no multiplication of the virus  and no host cell damage 
the ability to enhance the effectiveness of influenza vaccines would significantly enhance the supply 
that animal studies conducted in collaboration with the national institute of infectious diseases in japan  it was found that the co administration of our experimental immunostimulant ampligen may help enable substantial reductions in an hn vaccine dose  as well as provide cross protection against mutated strains of the hn virus 
new tests provided further evidence that alferon ldo low dose oral  a new delivery for an anti viral with prior regulatory approval for a category of sexually transmitted diseases  offers potential in resisting the spread of avian flu by stimulating genes that induce the production of immune compounds that are key building blocks in the body s defense system 
that alferon ldo may strengthen human immune responses via interferon activated genes  potentially staving off infection from exposure to viruses 
we expect to continue and accelerate these lines of research in on august   we licensed the rights  on a worldwide exclusive basis  the international patent estate developed at vanderbilt university for the in vivo use of dogs  abbreviation for a chemical compound dioctadecylamidoglycylspermine  for the efficient delivery of immunogenic dna to the interior of cells 
the acquisition of this intellectual property is expected to further enhance the position of hemispherx in the vaccine field by providing an enabling mechanism for genetic dna vaccination 
supporting and encouraging the development of dna based vaccines has become a major initiative of the us department of health and human services biodefense programs designed to counteract lethal viral outbreaks including avian influenza 
the large amounts of naked immunogenic dna usually required to induce immune responses in animals and its application in humans has been a major impediment to the development and licensure of genetic vaccines despite distinct biological advantages provided by this new form of immunization 
use of dogs technology increases the efficiency of dna vaccination  therefore potentially reducing significantly the amount of dna required to induce protective immune responses 
we plan to combine the dogs delivery of genetic immunogens with its immunostimulatory drug  ampligen  to create a new vaccine technology platform vaccine enhance with wide application for human and veterinary indications as well as an easily integrated tool in biodefense 
vulvar vestibulitis syndrome vvs alferon n 
injection is our injectable formulation of natural alpha interferon  and is approved by the fda for the intralesional treatment of refractory or recurring external genital warts condylomata acuminate in patients 
alferon n injection is the first and only natural human alfa interferon product made available in the united states 
it is an fda approved treatment for human papilloma viruses hpv and clinical trials are planned to extend the treatment indication to other hpv related disorders  especially in the female health sector 
our strategy is to pursue a modified fda approval for a related ailment with a large market opportunity and little competition 
vulvar vestibulitis syndrome is a perplexing and debilitating disorder involving pain limited to the vulvar vestibule 
the condition impairs sexual function  social interactions and creates psychological distress and despair in millions of women 
its cause may be multi factorial  and a number of studies have suggested vulvar vestibulitis syndrome to be linked to hpv 
the market opportunity is large and represents approximately million adult women in the united states alone 
we may initiate further clinical studies using alferon n to treat vvs during general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the years ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively  representing an increase of a  or 
the increase in g a expenses relates primarily to the adoption of fas r which has increased stock compensation expense approximately  during the current period versus a year ago 
in addition  we have incurred higher accounting fees related to the restatement of our financial statements which has increased these fees by approximately  from the same period a year earlier 
interest and other income and expense interest and other income for the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest and other income during the current period can primarily be attributed to the timing of the maturities of our marketable securities during the period versus the same period a year earlier 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs interest expense and non cash financing costs were approximately  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
the main reason for the decrease in interest expense and financing costs of  can be attributed to decreased amortization charges on debt discounts during the current period versus the same period a year earlier as our convertible debentures have come closer to maturity please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions 
years ended december  vs 
net loss applicable to common stockholders our net loss applicable to common stockholders of  for the year ended december  was down compared to the same period in this reduction of  in loss was primarily due to lower costs associated with non cash financing charges related to our convertible debentures and related warrants 
these non cash financing costs were down  and represents of the change in net loss from period to period  production cost of goods sold expenditures were down  due to increased expenditures during associated with ramping up of the new brunswick facility for further production of alferon n injection  deemed dividend of  recorded upon the issuance of warrants to our debenture holders as incentive to exercise prior warrant issuances in  and lower non cash stock compensation expenses of approximately  these lower expenses were slightly offset by an increase in research development r d costs during the current period of approximately  mainly due to costs associated with the future manufacture on technology at hollister stier  our contract manufacturer of ampligen 
net loss applicable to common stockholder per share was 
for the current period versus 
in the same period in the stock compensation expense noted above is due to a one time  non recurring event in that  warrants were granted to dr 
carter in and fully expensed in the amount of  upon vesting in these warrants were granted in exchange for dr 
carter agreeing not to exercise his warrants options unless  or until  stockholders approved an increase in our authorized shares 
this agreement with dr 
carter allowed us to complete the july debenture transactions 
revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the same period in alferon n injection sales of  in were down  or while ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program was down  or 
the decline in alferon n injection sales can be attributed to increased competition from rival products  specifically  m pharmaceutical s product aldera 
ampligen sold under the cost recovery clinical program is a product of physicians and me cfs patients applying to us to enroll in the program 
after screening the patient s enrollment records  we ship ampligen to the physician 
a typical six month treatment therapy costs the patient about  for ampligen 
this program has been in effect for many years and is offered as a treatment option to patients severely affected by me cfs 
as the name cost recovery implies  we have no gain or profit on these sales 
the benefits to us include physicians and patients becoming familiar with ampligen and collection of clinical data relating to the patients treatment and results 
production costs cost of goods sold our costs for production cost of goods sold were down  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  of this decrease in production costs is primarily due to expenses incurred in related to preparing the new brunswick facility for the production of alferon n injection 
there were no such costs in we are nearing completion of the construction of the production line within our own facility in new brunswick for ampligen raw materials which was started in this installation will increase production capacity  improve efficiency and assure compliance with worldwide drug manufacturing standards and processes 
alferon n injection cost of goods sold for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
since acquiring the right to manufacture and market alferon n injection in march  we have converted the work in progress inventory into finished goods as needed 
this work in progress inventory included three production lots totaling the equivalent of approximately  vials doses at various stages of the manufacturing process 
approximately  vials have been produced 
our contractor  hospira completed the labeling and packaging of approximately  vials of alferon n injection inventory and these vials were released into finished goods inventory in november hospira gave notice that they will no longer label and package alferon n injection as they are seeking larger production runs for cost efficiency purposes 
we have identified two manufacturers to replace hospira and  on february   we executed a manufacturing and safety agreement with hyaluron  inc hyaluron of burlington  massachusetts  for the formulation  packaging and labeling of alferon n injection 
pursuant to the agreement  we will supply raw materials in sufficient production quantities and provide technical information to the project 
we have started preliminary work to convert the third lot of approximately  vials to finished goods inventory with an anticipated completion date for the third quarter by the first quarter  we anticipate preparing new alferon n injection lots from blood leukocytes at our new jersey facility 
final formulation and packaging of alferon n injection would be completed by a third party contractor as noted above 
the installation of a ampligen raw material production line within our new brunswick facility has been completed and is now in production 
the transfer of ampligen raw material production to our own facilities has obvious advantages with respect to overall control of the manufacturing process  keeping costs down and controlling regulatory compliance issues other parts of our  sq 
ft 
wholly owned fda approved facility are already in compliance for alferon n injection manufacture 
this will also allow us to obtain ampligen raw materials on a more consistent and reliable basis 
as of april   we have capitalized approximately  towards the construction and installation of this production line 
the anticipated completion date for the first lot of ampligen raw material being produced is the second quarter we estimate the total cost of establishing this production line to be some  including modifications to our new brunswick facility 
this polymer production line will have the capacity to produce up to two kilograms per week  or approximately kilograms per year which should allow us to manufacture up to one quarter million mg doses per year 
we have identified three contract manufacturers to expand polymer manufacture  if necessary  and obtained preliminary proposals from two and initiated discussions with the third 
research and development costs overall research and development direct costs for the year ended december  and were  and  respectively 
these costs in reflect the direct costs associated with our effort to develop our lead product  ampligen  as a therapy in treating chronic diseases  cancers and on going clinical trials involving patients with hiv 
in addition  these costs reflect direct costs incurred relating to the development of alferon ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n  human leukocyte derived 
we had approximately  doses on hand of alferon ldo which was prepared for use in clinical trials treating patients affected with the sars  avian flu or other potentially emerging infectious diseases 
during  we increased our clinical staff by employing several highly trained individuals to focus on the preparation of our ampligen nda filing 
the nda filing is a very complex document and we are being meticulous in the preparation of the document 
our clinical monitors and research assistants completed the process of visiting the multiple clinical study sites around the country for our amp study in january our process included collecting and auditing data generated at each of these sites 
since we incorporated a larger sample of data from our previous trials for inclusion in the nda filing see below for further details  our clinical monitors and research assistants visited our sites associated with our amp study in for the purpose of collecting and auditing this additional data 
all data must be reviewed and checked to clarify any inconsistencies or inaccuracies are resolved 
due to the human factor  these types of problems occur in all clinical trials 
these gaps and inconsistencies in data must be resolved with the respective clinical investigators  while maintaining a clear record of events which allows the fda to conduct a meaningful audit of these records 
we believe that our amp me cfs phase iii clinical trial for use of ampligen in the treatment of me cfs is the most comprehensive study ever conducted in me cfs 
this phase iii clinical trial  which was conducted over a six year period  involved an enrollment of more than severely debilitated me cfs patients and was conducted at twelve medical centers throughout the united states 
the study is serving as the basis for us to file a new drug application with the fda 
we had originally targeted a late filing date for this nda for ampligen 
in order to respond to changes in the regulatory environment that place a greater emphasis on the safety and efficacy of all new experimental drug candidates  we incorporated a larger sample of data from our previous trials 
the nda filing now includes data accumulated from  administrations of the studied drug to approximately me cfs patients 
we are in the process of completing an nda registration process requesting fda approval for using ampligen to treat me cfs 
the clinical development of the experimental therapeutic  ampligen for me cfs was initiated approximately years ago 
to date federal health agencies have yet to reach a consensus regarding various aspects of me cfs  including parameters of promising therapies for me cfs and which aspects of me cfs are anticipated to be serious or life threatening 
over its developmental history  ampligen has received various designations  including orphan drug product certification fda  emergency compassionate cost recovery sales authorization fda and promising clinical outcome recognition based on the evaluation of certain summary clinical reports ahrq  agency health research quality 
however to date  the fda has determined it has yet to receive sufficient information to support the potential of ampligen to treat a serious or life threatening aspect of me cfs 
the definition of the seriousness of a condition  according to guidance for industry documents published in july  is a matter of judgment  but generally based on its impact on such factors as survival  day to day functioning  or the likelihood that the disease  if left untreated  will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one 
the fda has recently requested a complete and audited report of the amp study to determine whether ampligen has a clinically meaningful benefit on a serious or life threatening aspect of me cfs in order to evaluate whether the amp study results do or do not support a fast track designation 
the fda has also invited us to include a schedule for completion of all me cfs studies as well as a proposed schedule for our nda submission 
we are using our best efforts to complete the requisite reports including the hiring of new staff and various recognized expert medical regulatory consultants  but can provide no assurance as to whether the outcome of this large data collection and filing process approximately patients  treated more than  times will be favorable or unfavorable  specifically with respect to the fda s perspective 
we plan to use an independent contractor to file the nda electronically to facilitate the review by the fda 
also  we can provide no guidance as to the tentative date at which the compilation and filing of such data will be complete  as significant factors are outside our control including  without limitation  the ability and willingness of the independent clinical investigators to complete the requisite reports at an acceptable regulatory standard  the ability to collect overseas generated data  and the ability of hollister stier facilities to interface with our own new brunswick staff facilities to meet the manufacturing regulatory standards 
the timing of the fda review process of the nda is subject to the control of the fda and result in one of the following events  approval to market ampligen for use in treating me cfs patients  require more research  development  and clinical work  approval to market as well as conduct more testing  or reject our nda application 
given these variables  we are unable to project when material net cash inflows are expected to commence from the sale of ampligen 
our amp hiv study is a treatment using a strategic treatment interruption sti 
the patients antiviral haart regimens are interrupted and ampligen is substituted as mono immunotherapy 
patients  who have completed at least nine months of ampligen therapy  were able to stay off haart for a total sti duration with a mean time of weeks whereas the control group  which was also taken off haart  but not given ampligen  had earlier hiv rebound with a mean duration of weeks 
thus  on average  ampligen therapy spared the patients excessive exposure to haart  with its inherent toxicities  for more than weeks 
hiv patients have participated in this week study 
the rate of enrollment depends on patient availability and on other products being in clinical trials for the treatment of hiv  causing competition for the same patient population 
at present  more than fda approved drugs for hiv treatment competing for available patients 
the length  and subsequently the expense of these studies  will also be determined by an analysis of the interim data  which will determine when completion of the ongoing phase iib is appropriate and whether a phase iii trial will be conducted or not 
in case a phase iii study is required  the fda might require a patient population exceeding the current one which will influence the cost and time of the trial 
accordingly  the number of unknowns is sufficiently great to be unable to predict when  or whether  we may obtain revenues from our hiv treatment indications 
with the threat of an avian influenza pandemic rising and health officials warning that the virus could develop resistance to current flu treatments  the pursuit of a cost effective and complementary treatment to existing antivirals and vaccines has become critical 
this combination may permit the use of lower dosages and fewer injections of the antivirals and vaccines used to combat avian flu  thereby decreasing the cost of both immunization programs and treatment programs for the full blown disease 
in antimicrobial antibacterial therapy  which is the best studied clinical model  synergistic drug combinations may result in curative conditions outcomes  often not observed when the single drugs are given alone 
in the case of avian influenza where global drug supplies are presumptively in very limited supply relative to potential needs  therapeutic synergistic combinations could not only affect the disease outcome  but also the number of individuals able to access therapies 
at the fourth annual biodefense research meeting of the american society of microbiology held in washington  dc  we presented results of laboratory testing that showed our two investigational immunotherapeutics  ampligen and alferon  are potentially useful against hn  or avian flu  virus 
the pre clinical research indicates that ampligen  a specifically configured double stranded rna  can provide cross protection against avian flu viral mutations as well as boost the effectiveness of tamiflu and relenza  the only two drugs formally recognized for combating bird flu  up to times 
other lab tests  in healthy human volunteers  indicate that alferon ldo low dose oral  a new delivery form of an anti viral with prior regulatory approval for a category of sexually transmitted diseases  can stimulate genes that induce the production of interferon and other immune compounds  key building blocks in the body s defense system 
the studies were conducted in conjunction with the national institute of infectious diseases of japan 
we entered into an agreement with defence r d canada  suffield drdc suffield  an agency of the canadian department of national defence  to evaluate the antiviral efficacy of our experimental therapeutic ampligen and alferon for protection against human respiratory influenza virus infection in well validated animal models 
drdc suffield is conducting research and development of new drugs that could potentially become part of the arsenal of existing antiviral weapons to combat the bird flu 
the initial study will focus on the testing of potential drugs against the respiratory influenza virus infection on a mouse adapted strain of human influenza 
drdc suffield has already conducted extensive research in the use of liposome delivery technology to enhance the antiviral activity of a closely allied ampligen analogue  poly iclc an immunomodulating dsrna which is very similar to ampligen 
results suggest that ribo nucleic acid based drugs have the ability to elicit protective broad spectrum antiviral immunity against various pathogenic viruses 
hence  there is the potential for efficacy to be maintained against mutating strains of an influenza virus 
liposomes  a carrier system for nucleic acid based drugs  have shown an ability to protect these drugs against in vivo degradation  delivering them to intracellular sites of infection  thereby reducing any toxicity and prolonging their therapeutic effectiveness 
protection can be afforded for days with two doses of dsrna 
it is believed that in humans with active flu infection  tamiflu  given twice daily  may ameliorate symptoms 
a preclinical study was initiated in june  to determine if ampligen enhances the effectiveness of different drug combinations on avian influenza 
the preclinical study suggests a new  and potentially pivotal role of double stranded rna dsrna therapeutics in improving the efficacy of the present standards in care in both influenza prevention and treatment of acute disease 
the preclinical study is being conducted by research affiliates of the national institutes of health at utah state university to examine potential therapeutic synergies with different drug combinations 
the ongoing research is comparing the relative protection conveyed by tamiflu oseltamivir  roche and relenza zanamivir  glaxosmithkline with ampligen dsrna  alone and in combination  against the avian flu virus hn 
cell destruction was measured in vitro using different drug combinations 
both drugs  given alone  were effective in inhibiting cell destruction by avian influenza  but viral suppression with the combination was greater than either drug alone 
the overall assessment is that there was improvement in cell protection when ampligen was combined with oseltamivir carboxylate tamiflu and zanamivir relenza 
further immediate experimental tests are planned 
japanese researchers journal of virology page  have found that dsrnas increase the effectiveness of influenza vaccine by more than and may also convey cross protection ability against variant viruses mutated strains of influenza virus 
in october  we signed a research agreement with the national institute of infectious diseases  in tokyo  japan 
the collaboration  by hideki hasegawa  md  phd  chief of the laboratory of infectious disease pathology  will assess our experimental therapeutic ampligen as a co administered immunotherapeutic to the institution s nasal flu vaccine 
in october  we also engaged the sage group  inc  a health care  technology oriented  strategy and transaction advisory firm  to assist us in obtaining a strategic alliance in japan for the use of ampligen in treating chronic fatigue syndrome or cfs 
in the past year leaders in the japanese medical community have established the japanese society of the fatigue science and the osaka city university hospital opened the fatigue clinical center as the initial step in their fatigue research project 
a clinical study has been approved by the clinical research ethics committee of the kowloon west cluster at the princess margaret hospital in hong kong to evaluate the use of alferon ldo low dose oral interferon alfa n  human leukocyte derived in normal volunteers and or asymptomatic subjects with exposure to a person known to have sars 
this study completed the dosing of ten patients during the fourth quarter and we expect to complete analyzing the results of this study in the coming months 
a clinical study to evaluate the use of alferon ldo in hiv infected volunteers was initiated during the second quarter in philadelphia  pa 
the study is currently being conducted at two sites  drexel university and philadelphia fight  a comprehensive aids service organization providing primary care  consumer education  advocacy and research on potential treatments and vaccines 
the study is designed to determine whether alferon ldo can resuscitate the broad spectrum antiviral and immunostimulatory genes 
the initial patient enrolled in this study in july and  as of december  seven patients have enrolled and completed dosing 
we are currently receiving data from this study and we are in the process of analyzing the results 
this trial methodology may have implications for treating other emerging viruses such as avian influenza bird flu 
present production methods for vaccines involve the use of millions of chicken eggs and would be slow to respond to an outbreak according to a recently convened world health organization expert panel in november health officials are also concerned that bird flu could mutate to cause the next pandemic and render present vaccines under development ineffective 
in september  we commenced a clinical trial using alferon n injection to treat patients infected with the west nile virus 
the infectious disease section of new york queens hospital and the weill medical college of cornell university are conducting this double blinded  placebo controlled trial 
this study plans to enroll patients as they become available 
as of march   nine patients have entered this study 
the cdc reports that  cases of west nile virus have been reported in the us as of january   including deaths 
we completed the transfer and consolidation of our rockville quality assurance lab and equipment into our new brunswick facility 
we believe this consolidated lab will provide more efficiencies with regard to the quality assurance needs for both ampligen and alferon n injection 
in connection with settling various manufacturing infractions previously noted by the fda  schering entered into a consent decree with the fda whereby  among other things  it agreed to discontinue various contract third party manufacturing activities at various facilities including its san juan  puerto rico  plant 
ampligen which was not involved in any of the cited infractions was produced at this puerto rico plant from year operating under instructions from the consent decree  schering has advised us that it would no longer manufacture ampligen in this facility beyond and would assist us in an orderly transfer of said activities to other non schering facilities 
on december   we executed a supply agreement with hollister stier laboratories llc of spokane  washington  for the contract manufacturing of ampligen for a five year term 
pursuant to the agreement we will supply the key raw materials and hollister stier will formulate and bottle the ampligen 
we paid  as a deposit in order to initiate the manufacturing project 
this deposit was expended as research and development in the achievement of the initial objectives described in the agreement  in combination with our polymer production facility under construction in new brunswick  nj  may enable us to manufacture the raw materials for approximately  doses of ampligen per week 
we executed a confidentiality agreement with hollister stier  therefore  we completed the transfer of our manufacturing technology to hollister stier 
currently  hollister stier has completed two pilot manufacturing runs of ampligen for stability testing 
we have identified two other cgmp production facilities in the united states capable of manufacturing ampligen 
engagement of either of these facilities would provide back up to hollister stier and or provide additional production capacity if needed 
we are reviewing proposals from these production facilities and expect to act upon one or the other at the appropriate time 
please see results of operations for the years ended december  and for further updates on research and development 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the years ended december  and were approximately  and  respectively 
the decrease in g a expenses of  is primarily due to a non cash stock compensation charge in of  resulting from the issuance of  warrants to purchase common stock at per share to dr 
carter in that vested in the first quarter higher professional fees  specifically legal costs  during  slightly offset this decrease in g a as we initiated legal proceedings seeking injunction relief and damages against conspiratorial group engaged in illegal activities to take over hemispherx and enrich themselves at the expense of our stockholders 
please see item legal proceedings in part i  above for more information 
interest and other income interest and other income for the years ended december  and totaled  and  respectively 
the increase in interest and other income during the year can primarily be attributed to the maturing of marketable securities during the period 
all funds in excess of our immediate need are invested in short term high quality securities 
interest expense and financing costs non cash financing costs and interest expenses were approximately  for the year ended december  versus  for the same period a year ago 
non cash financing costs consist of the amortization of original issue discounts and amortization of the costs associated with beneficial conversion features of our debentures and the relative fair value of the warrants relating to the debentures 
these charges are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations under the caption financing costs 
the main reason for the decrease in financing costs and interest expense of  or can be attributed to the aggregate total of these charges being reduced since due to decreased amortization charges as well as lower charges related to the conversion of debentures and the principal amounts decreasing 
please see note in the consolidated financial statements contained herein for more details on these transactions

as of february  we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  or an increase of approximately from december  these funds should be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements including debt service for the next months 
over the long term  we may need to raise additional funds through additional equity or debt financing or from other sources in order to complete the necessary clinical trials and the regulatory approval processes including the commercializing of ampligen products 
there can be no assurances that we will raise adequate funds from these or other sources  which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our products 
any additional funding may result in significant dilution and could involve the issuance of securities with rights  which are senior to those of existing stockholders 
we may also need additional funding earlier than anticipated  and our cash requirements  in general  may vary materially from those now planned  for reasons including  but not limited to  changes in our research and development programs  clinical trials  competitive and technological advances  the regulatory process  and higher than anticipated expenses and lower than anticipated revenues from certain of our clinical trials for which cost recovery from participants has been approved

the requirements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the purpose of fin is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation are required to be reported separately as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
management does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial condition or the results of our operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments fas an amendment of fasb statements no 
and fas amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fas  and sfas no 
fas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  to permit fair value re measurement of any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation 
additionally  fas seeks to clarify which interest only strips and principal only strips are not subject to the requirements of fas and to clarify that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  management does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on the financial condition or the results of our operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
currently  over accounting standards within gaap require or permit entities to measure assets and liabilities at fair value 
prior to statement  the methods for measuring fair value were diverse and inconsistent  especially for items that are not actively traded 
the standard clarifies that for items that are not actively traded  such as certain kinds of derivatives  fair value should reflect the price in a transaction with a market participant  including an adjustment for risk  not just the our mark to market value 
statement also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
under statement  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  statement establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of statement are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
management does not believe the adoption of this standard will have a material impact in the financial condition or results of our operations 
disclosure about off balance sheet arrangements none critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding our reported financial results are the following revenue revenue from the sale of ampligen under cost recovery clinical treatment protocols approved by the fda is recognized when the treatment is provided to the patient 
revenues from the sale of product are recognized when the product is shipped  as title is transferred to the customer 
we have no other obligation associated with our products once shipment has occurred 
short term investments investments with original maturities of more than three months and less than months and marketable equity securities are considered available for sale 
the investments classified as available for sale include debt securities and equity securities carried at estimated fair value 
the unrealized gains and losses are recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
inventories we use the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market method of accounting for inventory 
patents and trademarks patents and trademarks are stated at cost primarily legal fees and are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years 
we review our patents and trademark rights periodically to determine whether they have continuing value 
such review includes an analysis of the patent and trademark s ultimate revenue and profitability potential 
in addition  management s review addresses whether each patent continues to fit into our strategic business plans 
convertible securities with beneficial conversion features the march  july  october  january and july debenture issuances and related embedded conversion features and warrants issuances were accounted for in accordance with eitf accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingency adjustable conversion and with eitf no 
application of issue no 
to certain convertible instruments 
we determined the fair values to be ascribed to detachable warrants issued with the convertible debentures utilizing the black scholes method 
discounts derived from determining the beneficial conversion feature and fair value of the warrants based on the relative fair value of the proceeds are amortized to financing costs over the remaining life of the debenture in accordance with the effective interest method of accounting 
the unamortized discount upon the conversion of the debentures is expensed to financing cost on a pro rata basis 
stock based compensation under fas r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted the provisions of fas r  effective january   using a modified prospective application 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all share based payments granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  as well as for any unvested awards that were granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
because we previously adopted only the pro forma disclosure provisions of fas  it will recognize compensation cost relating to the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the date of adoption  using the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosures under fas  except that forfeiture rates will be estimated for all options  as required by fas r 
the cumulative effect of applying the forfeiture rates is not material 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option valuation model 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the price of our common stock 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury issues with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
we use uses historical data to estimate expected dividend yield  expected life and forfeiture rates 
concentration of credit risk our policy is to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution and place investments with financial institutions evaluated as being credit worthy  or in short term money markets  which are exposed to minimal interest rate and credit risks 
at and since december   we have had bank deposits and overnight repurchase agreements that exceed federally insured limits 
concentration of credit risk  with respect to receivables  is limited through our credit evaluation process 
we do not require collateral on our receivables 
our receivables consist principally of amounts due from wholesale drug companies as of december  sales to three large wholesalers represented approximately and of our total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december  to the extent that our cash and cash equivalents exceed our near term funding needs  we invest the excess cash in three to twelve month interest bearing financial instruments 
we employ established conservative policies and procedures to manage any risks with respect to investment exposure 
we have not entered into  and do not expect to enter into  financial instruments for trading or hedging purposes
