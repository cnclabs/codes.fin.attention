accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and cash flows that we would experience if the operations of the two companies had been combined for the entire period presented 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of novel  proprietary antibody based products for cancer  inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
merger of cancervax corporation and micromet ag on may   cancervax corporation completed a merger with micromet ag  a privately held german company  pursuant to which cancervax s wholly owned subsidiary  carlsbad acquisition corporation  merged with and into micromet holdings  inc  a newly created parent corporation of micromet ag 
micromet holdings became a wholly owned subsidiary of cancervax and was the surviving corporation in the merger 
cancervax issued to micromet ag stockholders shares of cancervax common stock and cancervax assumed all of the stock options  stock warrants and restricted stock of micromet holdings outstanding as of may   such that the former micromet ag stockholders  option holders  warrant holders and note holders owned  as of the closing  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and former cancervax stockholders  option holders and warrant holders owned  as of the closing  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis 
in connection with the merger  cancervax was renamed micromet  inc and our nasdaq global market ticker symbol was changed to miti 
ongoing business activities we are a biopharmaceutical company focusing on the development of novel  proprietary antibody based products for cancer  inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
two of our product candidates are currently in clinical trials  while the remainder of our pipeline is in preclinical development 
mt  also known as medi  which 
table of contents is the first product candidate based on our proprietary bite product development platform  is being evaluated in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with non hodgkins lymphoma 
the bite product development platform is based on a unique  antibody based class of drug candidates that leverages the cytotoxic potential of t cells  widely recognized as the most powerful killer cells of the human immune system 
adecatumumab  also known as mt  a recombinant human monoclonal antibody which targets epcam expressing tumors  has completed two phase a clinical trials  one in patients with breast cancer and the other in patients with prostate cancer 
in addition  a phase b trial evaluating the safety and tolerability of adecatumumab in combination with docetaxel is currently ongoing in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
we have established collaborations with medimmune  inc for mt and merck serono for adecatumumab 
we believe that we also have a strong proprietary technology platform for the development of additional antibody based product candidates 
our goal is to develop products for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune diseases that address significant unmet medical needs 
we believe that our novel technologies  product candidates and product development expertise in these fields will continue to enable us to identify and develop promising new product opportunities for these critical markets 
to date  we have incurred significant expenses and have not achieved any product revenues from sales of our product candidates 
each of our programs will require many years and significant costs to advance through development 
typically it takes many years from the initial identification of a lead compound to the completion of pre clinical and clinical trials  before applying for marketing approval from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  the european medicines agency  or emea  or other equivalent international regulatory agencies 
the risk that a program has to be terminated  in part or in full  for safety reasons  or lack of adequate efficacy is very high 
in particular  we can neither predict which  if any  potential product candidates can be successfully developed and for which marketing approval may be obtained  nor predict the time and cost to complete development 
as we obtain results from pre clinical studies or clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates for safety  efficacy or commercial reasons 
we may also elect to discontinue development of one or more product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
depending on the structure of such collaborative agreements  a third party may be granted control over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates 
in such a situation  the third party  rather than us  may in fact control development and commercialization decisions for the respective product candidate 
consistent with our business model  we may enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future 
we cannot predict the terms of such agreements or their potential impact on our capital requirements 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner  or our failure to enter into new collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and affect our liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through private placements of preferred stock  government grants for research  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  debt financing  licensing revenues and milestone achievements and  more recently  by accessing the capital resources of cancervax through the merger and a subsequent private placement of common stock and associated warrants 
we intend to continue to seek funding through public or private financings in the future 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience substantial dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to existing stockholders 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through debt financings  these financings may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
based on our capital resources as of the date of this report  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations into the second quarter of  without considering any potential future milestone payments  that we may receive under current or future collaborations  any future capital raising transactions or any drawdowns from the committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited 

table of contents research and development and in process research and development through december   our research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with the clinical development of adecatumumab and mt  as well as pre clinical development costs for a new bite molecule called mt and a new human antibody against granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor  or gm csf  called mt  and research activities under our collaboration with medimmune and the bite platform 
the costs incurred include costs associated with clinical trials and manufacturing process  quality systems and analytical development  including compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
we charged all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
in addition  as a result of our merger with cancervax  we acquired in process research and development ipr d projects with an assigned value of million 
the fair value of the ipr d projects was determined utilizing the income approach  assuming that the rights to the ipr d projects will be sub licensed to third parties in exchange for certain up front  milestone and royalty payments  and the combined company will have no further involvement in the ongoing development and commercialization of the projects 
under the income approach  the expected future net cash flows from sub licensing for each ipr d project are estimated  risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the discount rate are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets 
management believes that the discount rate utilized is consistent with the projects stage of development and the uncertainties in the estimates described above 
because the acquired ipr d projects are in the early stages of the development cycle  the amount allocated to ipr d were recorded as an expense immediately upon completion of the merger 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we further develop our compounds into more advanced stages of clinical development and increase our pre clinical efforts for our human antibodies and bite molecules in cancer  anti inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
our strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be partly or wholly funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified development or commercialization milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon our collaborations 
under our adecatumumab  or mt  collaboration agreement with ares trading  sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of serono international  sa which has recently been merged into merck kgaa to form merck serono  we received million in up front and milestone payments from merck serono to date not including reimbursements for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development of adecatumumab 
the agreement provides for potential future clinical development milestone payments of up to an additional million 
in a november amendment to the original agreement the parties agreed that we would continue to conduct an ongoing clinical trial testing the safety of adecatumumab with docetaxel in patients suffering from metastatic breast cancer and a second clinical trial to be initiated in other solid tumors in all of our cost for development related to adecatumumab will be fully reimbursed by merck serono 
our collaboration agreement with medimmune for mt provides for potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on net sales of mt a second agreement with medimmune for the development of new bite product candidates provides for potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on future sales of the bite product candidates currently under development pursuant to that agreement 
the potential milestone payments are subject to the successful completion of development and obtaining marketing approval for one or more indications in one or more national markets 
we intend to pursue additional collaborations to provide resources for further development of our product candidates and expect to continue to grant technology access licenses 
however  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements  and if we do  on what terms we might do so 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs associated with these product 
table of contents candidates to increase as we continue to develop new indications and move these product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  the likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as relevant commercial factors 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition our revenues generally consist of licensing fees  milestone payments  royalties and fees for research services earned from license agreements or from research and development collaboration agreements 
we recognize revenue upon satisfying the following four criteria persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on up front payments over the expected life of the development and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
milestone payments are derived from the achievement of predetermined goals under the collaboration agreements 
for milestones that are subject to contingencies  the related contingent revenue is not recognized until the milestone has been reached and customer acceptance has been obtained as necessary 
fees for research and development services performed under the agreements are generally stated at a yearly fixed fee per research scientist 
we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
amounts received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we have received initial license fees and annual renewal fees upfront each year under license agreements 
revenue is recognized when the above noted criteria are satisfied unless we have further obligations associated with the license granted 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments on the sale of products under license and collaboration agreements 
royalties are based upon the volume of products sold and are recognized as revenue upon notification of sales from the customer 
through december   we have not received or recognized any royalty payments 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is allocated to the separated units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue on development and collaboration agreements  including upfront payments  where they are considered combined units of accounting  over the expected life of the development and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 

table of contents purchase price allocation in business combinations the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective values 
in fiscal  we completed our merger with cancervax 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources  and developing appropriate discount rates and success probability rates by project 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
as a result of our merger with cancervax  we recorded million of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was recoverable 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of goodwill impairment will not result in a material charge 
long lived and intangible assets the evaluation for impairment of long lived and intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgment by management 
subsequent to the initial recording of long lived and intangible assets  we must test such assets for impairment 
when we conduct our impairment tests  factors that are important in determining whether impairment might exist include assumptions regarding our underlying business and product candidates and other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external factors  could result in impairment 
such impairment charge  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
effective january   we began recognizing share based compensation  under sfas no 
r  for all awards granted during based on each award s grant date fair value 
prior to adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recorded estimated compensation expense for employee stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  following the minimum value method 
under the guidance of sfas  we estimated the value of stock options issued to employees using the black scholes options pricing model with a near zero volatility assumption a minimum value model 
the value was determined based on the stock price of our stock on the date of grant and was recognized to expense over the vesting period using the straight line method 
we implemented sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method our financial statements and related information presented pertaining to periods prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r have not been adjusted to reflect fair value of the share based compensation expense 
prior to january   there was no significant stock compensation expense recorded 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of each share based award on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
to facilitate our adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied the provisions of sab in developing our methodologies to estimate our black scholes model inputs 
option valuation models  including black scholes  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividend yield is projected at as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies 
the expected term of at the money options granted is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in sab the expected term for other options granted was determined by comparison to peer companies 
sfas no 
r also requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate for the year ended december  was based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom the options were granted 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is years 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertain tax positions  fin to clarify the criteria for recognizing tax benefits under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and to require additional financial statement disclosure 
fin requires that we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we currently recognize the impact of a tax position if it is probable of being sustained 
the provisions of fin are effective for us beginning january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we do not believe that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the sec released sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides interpretive guidance on the sec s views regarding the process of quantifying the materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after november   with early application for the first interim period ending after november  our adoption of sab no 
in the fourth quarter of did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently assessing the impact that sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations subsequent to december   we have engaged in a number of significant transactions  including the merger with cancervax in may as a result  our results of operations for the year ended december  are very difficult to compare to the results of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
the following table summarizes our primary sources of revenue for the periods presented in millions for the year ended december  december  merck serono revenue collaborative r d revenue milestone payment total revenue from merck serono medimmune revenue collaborative r d revenue milestone payment total revenue from medimmune other collaborative r d revenue license revenue other revenue total revenues collaborative research and development revenues from merck serono reflect their full cost responsibility for the adecatumumab program 
collaborative research and development revenues from medimmune represent their share of the costs of clinical development of mt and their full cost responsibility for the development of two new bite candidates 
the increase for the year results from the million milestone payment recognized under the merck serono agreement during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by decreases in collaborative research and development revenues under that agreement as phase a clinical activities were substantially completed in mid year in may  we received a million settlement payment from cell therapeutics  inc cti  the acquirer of novuspharma spa  with whom we previously had a research and development collaboration 
the settlement payment was included in collaboration revenue during the quarter ended june  because the amount would have been recorded as collaboration revenue had the original contract been fulfilled 
in  we earned other collaborative r d revenue from enzon of million related to an agreement that was terminated in research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover  research and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  outside service costs including production of clinical material  fees for services in the context of clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
process development expenses were mainly incurred for production of good manufacturing practice  or gmp grade clinical trial material  as well as fermentation  purification and formulation development 
preclinical development expenses cover pharmacological in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as development of analytical testing procedures 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in the amounts was a share based compensation expense of million  which was not reflected in the decrease in the remaining research and development expenses primarily results from a decrease in clinical manufacturing and completion of our phase a studies for the adecatumumab program 
in process research and development 
as a result of our merger with cancervax  we acquired ipr d projects with an assigned value of million 
the fair value of the ipr d projects was determined utilizing the income approach  assuming that the rights to the ipr d projects will be sub licensed to third parties in exchange for certain up front  milestone and royalty payments  and the combined company will have no further involvement 
table of contents in the ongoing development and commercialization of the projects 
under the income approach  the expected future net cash flows from sub licensing for each ipr d project were estimated  risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the discount rate were the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets 
management believes that the discount rate utilized is consistent with the projects stage of development and the uncertainties in the estimates described above 
because the acquired ipr d projects are in the early stages of the development cycle  the amount allocated to ipr d were recorded as an expense immediately upon completion of the merger 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal and audit services 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in the amounts was a share based compensation expense of million  which was not reflected in the remainder of the increase in general and administrative expense results from the incremental costs associated with being a public company in  including us based personnel  investor relations  auditing and tax fees and increased directors and officers insurance premiums 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the conversion of all but million of the convertible notes that had been outstanding during interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for year ended december  the increase in interest income was primarily due to an increase in average cash balances  as a result of cash acquired in connection with the merger with cancervax and from the net proceeds of million received in the july ngn capital financing 
other income expense 
other income expense includes foreign currency transaction gains losses and miscellaneous other items 
other income expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase results from a gain upon early repayment of approximately million in debt during the fourth quarter of comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
the following table summarizes our primary sources of revenue for the periods presented in millions for the year ended december  december  merck serono collaborative r d revenue medimmune collaborative r d revenue enzon collaborative r d revenue cti novuspharma collaborative r d revenue license revenue other revenue total revenues revenues relate primarily to collaboration agreements for the further development of our product candidate pipeline 
in  revenues increased by approximately compared to mainly due to the merck serono collaboration  which was executed in december this increase was partially offset by the decrease in revenue from the collaboration with novuspharma  subsequently acquired by cti  that was terminated in see item above 

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  spending on process development decreased substantially from million in to million in in  our expenditures in process development were million on adecatumumab and million on other preclinical programs 
in  was spent on process development  of which million was spent on clinical trial material for adecatumumab 
preclinical development expenses in was million  compared to million in spending on clinical trials increased to million in compared to million in the increase is mainly due to increased clinical spending for the two adecatumumab phase a clinical trials which was million in compared to million in as a consequence of the restructuring of operations during  we reorganized our operations in order to vacate space that could be offered for subleases 
we also recorded million for losses on sublease for the remaining lease period in the year ended december  we recorded an impairment charge of  related to leasehold improvements that will no longer be utilized 
the losses on the sublease and the impairment charge are included in research and development expense in there were no corresponding charges incurred in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  general and administrative expenses increased by approximately  primarily due to increased fees for advisory fees for consultation on general financing strategies and valuation and other issues 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in  compared to million in mainly due to million of accrued interest in related to a interest bearing note which was issued in november  compared to only million incurred in related to this note 
the note was converted in january into preferred shares of micromet ag 
other interest expense in and related to i borrowings from eight silent partnerships bearing interest at annual rates between and and accrued interest for the same partnerships for final payments payable upon the due date  ii a interest bearing convertible note from curis  which was modified to a non interest bearing note in december  iii a interest bearing convertible note from enzon  which was converted into common shares in january  and iv a interest bearing convertible note issued in to medimmune 
interest income 
interest income is primarily derived by interest bearing investment activities 
in  interest income increased by to  compared to  in  as a result of larger average cash balances and increased interest yield 
interest income varies with the amounts of cash we have available for investing at any given time 
other income expense 
other income expense for the years ended december  and primarily reflects fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and us dollar 
as of december   a million upfront license fee payment was outstanding from merck serono that resulted in an unrealized loss on exchange in upon payment of this amount in january  a gain on exchange was recognized 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million as of december   and  respectively 
the increase in results primarily from cash acquired in the merger with cancervax  less repayments of long term debt 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million used in operating activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities from to was primarily due to the receipt of million from merck serono in for upfront license fees and other receipts under our collaboration agreement  compared to million cash received from merck serono in and the payment of million of liabilities and accrued expenses that had been assumed in the merger with cancervax 

table of contents net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to  used in investing activities for the year ended december  the increase consisted almost entirely of million of cash  net of costs paid  acquired in connection with our merger with cancervax 
net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided in financing activities for the year ended december  significant components of cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  included the repayment of the silicon valley bank loan of million  which had been assumed in connection with the merger  and repayment of an aggregate of million of long term debt to silent partnerships  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock to funds managed by ngn capital llc and million in capital contributions from stockholders 
in january  our silent partnership agreements with bayern kapital gmbh and technologie beteiligungsfonds bayern gmbh co 
kg were amended to accelerate repayment of amounts due principal  accrued interest  and one time payments upon the occurrence of future rounds of financing after the consummation of the merger with cancervax 
as a result of these amendments  until the silent partnership debt has been repaid in full  of the proceeds from future financings will be used for repayment of accelerated silent partnership debt 
in july  million of accelerated payment was triggered by the financing with ngn capital  llc and was paid in the fourth quarter of any draw downs under the kingsbridge ceff discussed below would also be subject to the repayment of accelerated silent partnership debt 
the total amount subject to accelerated repayment as of december  is million  of which million was repaid on january  on july   we closed a private placement pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock plus warrants to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock to funds managed by ngn capital  llc in return for aggregate gross proceeds  before expenses  of million 
we incurred investment banking fees  legal fees and other financing costs of approximately million  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with this issuance of common stock to funds managed by ngn capital llc  we issued warrants to such funds to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
the warrants became exercisable six months following their date of issuance  expire six years after issuance  and are exercisable at a price of per share 
on august   we entered into a committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase up to million of our common stock 
subject to certain restrictions we may require kingsbridge to purchase newly issued common stock at a price that is between and of the volume weighted average price on each trading day during an eight day pricing period 
under the terms of the ceff  the maximum number of shares we may sell to kingsbridge is  shares  subject to certain limitations 
in connection with the ceff  we also issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant is exercisable beginning six months after the date of issuance  which was august   and for a period of five years thereafter 
as a result of the merger with cancervax  we assumed million of an million loan and security agreement between cancervax and silicon valley bank 
on september   we repaid all amounts due and owing under the agreement and terminated the agreement 
effective immediately upon the termination of the agreement  all security interests and other liens held by the bank in all of our properties  rights and other assets were discharged 
in december  we entered into a collaboration agreement with ares trading sa  a wholly owned subsidiary of serono international sa  a leading swiss biotechnology firm that was recently acquired by merck kgaa and that is now called merck serono biopharmaceuticals sa  or merck serono 
pursuant to the agreement  we granted merck serono a worldwide license under our relevant patents and know how to develop  manufacture  commercialize and use adecatumumab for the prevention and treatment of any human disease 
merck serono paid an initial license fee of million and has made three milestone payments in the total amount of million to date 
the most recent milestone paid was a million payment made in november after the delivery by us of the study reports on two phase clinical trials conducted with adecatumumab 
overall  the agreement provides for merck serono to pay up to an additional million in milestone payments if adecatumumab is successfully developed and registered worldwide in at least three indications 

table of contents to date  we have funded our operations through proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  government grants for research  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  licensing and milestone payments related to our product candidate partnering activities  debt financing and  more recently  by accessing the capital resources of cancervax through the merger and through a subsequent private placement of common stock and associated warrants 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next several years and we will need to raise additional funds to meet future working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we may wish to raise substantial funds through the sale of our common stock or raise additional funds through debt financing or through additional strategic collaboration agreements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or whether it will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock  substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result 
if we were to raise additional funds through additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
prior to our merger with cancervax  cancervax was a party to three building leases associated with a manufacturing facility  a warehouse facility and cancervax s corporate headquarters 
during the second quarter of cancervax entered into a lease assignment related to the manufacturing facility  a lease termination related to the warehouse facility and a sublease agreement pursuant to which  rentable square feet of the  total rentable square feet of cancervax s former corporate headquarters was subleased 
we paid termination related fees of approximately million in connection with the termination of the warehouse facility 
our remaining estimated lease exit liability related to these facilities amounted to million at december  of which million is included in accrued expenses and million is included in other non current liabilities 
in connection with the proposed relocation of our corporate headquarters to bethesda  maryland  we are currently seeking to sublease the remaining  rentable square feet of cancervax s corporate headquarters

curis had requested immediate repayment of the remaining million at the time of the closing of the merger between cancervax and micromet ag in may we had disagreed with curis s interpretation of the repayment terms of the promissory note 
in accordance with the settlement  we paid curis million  or million  in october  and will pay million on or before may  the second payment will be reduced to million if payment is made on or before april  the payments will be made by us without any interest charges 
each of the parties will bear their own costs incurred in connection with the litigation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us and foreign government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rates a significant majority of our cash and cash equivalents are currently denominated in us dollars  as are a significant amount of the potential milestone payments and royalty payments under our collaboration agreements 
however  a significant portion of our operating expenses  including our research and development expenses  are incurred in europe pursuant to arrangements that are generally denominated in euros 
as a result  our financial results and capital resources may be affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
as of december   we had us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents of million and euro denominated liabilities of approximately million 
the euro amount as of december  is equivalent to approximately million  using the exchange rate as of that date 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an increase in our reported operating expenses due to the translation of the euro denominated expenses into us dollars  and such changes would negatively impact the length of time that our existing capital resources would be sufficient to finance our operations 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions to manage this exchange rate exposure
