item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis provides information that the company believes is useful in understanding kemet s operating results  cash flows  and financial condition for the three fiscal years ended march  the discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
except for the historical information contained here  the discussions in this document contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of and involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual future results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the safe harbor statement and  from time to time  in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
overview kemet is a leading manufacturer of tantalum capacitors  multilayer ceramic capacitors  and solid aluminum capacitors 
capacitors are electronic components that store  filter  and regulate electrical energy and current flow and are one of the essential passive components used on circuit boards 
virtually all electronic applications and products contain capacitors  including communication systems  data processing equipment  personal computers  cellular phones  automotive electronic systems  military and aerospace systems  and consumer electronics 
the company s business strategy is to be the preferred capacitor supplier to the world s most successful electronics original equipment manufacturers  electronics manufacturing services providers  and electronics distributors 
the company intends to reach this goal through technology leadership  organic and strategic growth initiatives and by continuing to provide state of the art customer service 
the company reaches its customers through a direct  salaried sales force that calls on customer locations around the world 
in fiscal year  total net sales were broken down geographically as follows the americas sales were approximately  apac sales were approximately  and emea sales were approximately 
the company manufactures capacitors in the united states  mexico  portugal  and china 
commodity manufacturing in the united states  for the most part  has been relocated see enhanced strategic plan to the company s lower cost manufacturing facilities in mexico and china 
production that remains in the united states will focus primarily on early stage manufacturing of new products and other specialty products for which customers are predominantly located in north america 
the market for tantalum  ceramic  and aluminum capacitors is highly competitive 
the capacitor industry is characterized by  among other factors  a long term trend toward lower prices for capacitors  low transportation costs  and few import barriers 
competitive factors that influence the market for the company s products include product quality  customer service  technical innovation  pricing  and timely delivery 
the company believes that it competes favorably on the basis of each of these factors 
electronic products are in a long term growth phase as evidenced by the proliferation of cellular phones  personal computers  and consumer electronics 
the growth of the capacitor industry  however  has been cyclical  and lower average selling prices for capacitors have corresponded with the long term growth in units 
average selling prices asps capacitor average selling prices have trended down over the long term growth period 
kemet estimates the historical average annual decrease in asps to be approximately to 
this  in turn  requires the company to effectively manage costs to remain competitive 
an example of this is the company s decision to move the manufacture of commodity manufacturing to low cost locations 
see enhanced strategic plan 
cyclicality periods of significant expansion and correction have marked the long term growth of the capacitor market 
expansion periods expansion periods usually offer the opportunity for the company to exercise more control over asps as industry capacity utilization is high 
customer demand often exceeds the available supply 
firm or higher pricing combined with higher volumes cause this to be the most profitable part of the cycle for the industry  and the industry generally adds capacity during this period 
correction periods correction periods usually offer the opportunity for the customer to exercise more control over asps as industry capacity exceeds customer demand 
lower pricing combined with lower volumes during this period cause this to be the least profitable part of the cycle for the industry 
the fiscal year ended march  represented a cyclical peak and the company reported record revenues and profits of billion and million  respectively 
during such an expansion period  the company is challenged with meeting demand and not over expanding capacity  which it may not be able to bring on line until after the expansion 
the increase in demand requires maintaining higher raw material inventory levels at higher prices  which challenges the company to increase inventory turnover as well as managing inventory to a reasonable level to reduce issues such as obsolescence  particularly when the expansion ends 
the four fiscal years following fiscal year ie fiscal year through fiscal year represent what the company considers an unprecedented correction phase of the long term growth trend 
demand decreased markedly  and the quarterly decline in asps was often in excess of the historical average annual decrease 
during such a correction phase  the company is challenged with aligning costs with the reduced stream of revenues 
the company must remain financially sound with sufficient financial liquidity to not only operate effectively during the correction phase but also have the financial wherewithal to react when the next expansion cycle begins 
during this correction phase  the company began a number of initiatives see special charges for fiscal year  and to meet these challenges 
in fiscal year  the company believes that the unprecedented correction phase concluded as evidenced by lower percentage decreases in asps 
the company saw asps actually remain flat  adjusted for product mix during the last two fiscal quarters of that year 
during fiscal year  the company experienced basically flat asps  adjusted for product mix  and continued to see an increase in demand 
at march   the company had million of cash and short and long term investments 
kemet intends to satisfy both its short term and long term liquidity requirements primarily with existing cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operations 
during the fiscal year ending march   the company issued convertible senior notes in the amount of million 
the funds were obtained to strengthen the company s liquidity position in the event of another downward cycle 
please refer to the discussion below under the heading acquisitions for a discussion of the recent use of a portion of the company s cash and short and long term investments 
business segments effective october   the company organized into two distinct business units the tantalum business unit tantalum and the ceramics business unit ceramics 
each business unit is responsible for the operations of certain manufacturing sites as well as all related research and development efforts 
the sales and marketing functions are shared by each of the business units and are allocated to the business units 
in addition  all corporate costs are also allocated to the business units 
tantalum business unit the tantalum business unit operates in six manufacturing sites in the united states  mexico  portugal  and china 
this business unit produces tantalum and aluminum capacitors 
the business unit also maintains a product innovation center in the united states 
sales of tantalum s products are made in all regions in the world 
ceramics business unit the ceramics business unit operates in three manufacturing sites in mexico and china 
this business unit produces ceramic capacitors 
in addition  the business unit also has a product innovation center in the united states 
sales of ceramics products are made in all regions in the world 
acquisitions tantalum business unit of epcos ag as previously reported  pursuant to the terms of an asset and share purchase agreement and an asset purchase agreement between kemet corporation and certain of its subsidiaries the company or kemet and epcos ag  a german corporation epcos  the company completed the purchase of the tantalum business unit of epcos on april  for a purchase price of eur million approximately million 
the acquisition included all of the issued share capital of epcos pecas e componentes electronicos sa and certain other assets of the tantalum business unit of epcos  primarily in germany 
of the eur million  kemet paid in cash approximately eur million approximately million and assumed certain liabilities and working capital adjustments of eur million 
as previously announced  the acquisition did not include epcos tantalum capacitor manufacturing facility in heidenheim  germany 
as a result  kemet and epcos entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement under which epcos continued to manufacture product exclusively for kemet at the heidenheim facility to ensure a continued supply of product to customers during the transition period 
in connection with the acquisition  the company paid approximately million in legal and professional fees which have been included as part of the purchase price 
on september   the company agreed upon the final purchase amount related to the april  closing date and accordingly received a favorable credit of eur million approximately million 
this amount reduced the company s goodwill recorded in the transaction 
the transition period concluded on september   and consequently  kemet purchased certain of the heidenheim  germany manufacturing assets and the research and development assets at a price of eur million approximately million 
the company also purchased inventories at the heidenheim plant for eur million approximately million 
in addition  the company assumed a pension liability of eur million approximately million for the heidenheim employees 
finally  the company incurred additional legal and audit fees relating to the acquisition of million 
the net additional purchase price was eur million approximately million 
taking into account both the april  closing adjustment and the transition agreement on september   the company purchased the tantalum business unit of epcos for a total purchase price of eur million approximately million 
the final cash settlement was made in october the purchase price was determined through arms length negotiations between representatives of the company and epcos 
evox rifa group oyj on april   kemet corporation announced that its wholly owned subsidiary  kemet electronics corporation kemet  had purchased approximately of the shares in evox rifa group oyj evox rifa pursuant to a tender offer which commenced on march   and was completed on april  evox rifa had  shares outstanding at the time of the commencement of the tender offer 
kemet purchased approximately million shares at a price of eur per share or approximately eur million approximately million  representing a premium to the volume weighted average trading price of the evox rifa shares on the helsinki stock exchange during the months prior to february  and approximately a premium to the average trading price during the months prior to february  kemet has also announced that it intends to acquire the remaining outstanding shares pursuant to a squeeze out proceeding 
following the settlement of the completion trades relating to the tender offer  evox rifa has become a subsidiary of kemet 
in addition  pursuant to the tender offer  kemet offered to acquire all of the outstanding loan notes under the convertible capital loan issues by evox rifa for a consideration corresponding to the aggregate of the nominal amount per loan note of eur plus accrued interest up to and including the closing date of the tender offer 
the outstanding amount of the loan notes at the time of the commencement of the tender offer totaled approximately eur million approximately million 
holders of approximately of the convertible capital loan notes issued by evox rifa have tendered their loan notes pursuant to the tender offer  and kemet has redeemed these notes as of april  kemet redeemed approximately eur million approximately million of the total outstanding convertible capital loan notes and paid all accrued interest up until the date of settlement of the tender offer 
in addition to the payment made for the shares and loan notes  kemet assumed approximately eur million approximately million in outstanding indebtedness of evox rifa 
the total purchase price for evox rifa  assuming the acquisition of all shares and loan notes at the tender offer price  is expected to be approximately million 
the company is in the process of recording the acquisition and will provide the necessary financial information in a later filing with the securities and exchange commission 
the company anticipates that these acquisitions will further strengthen its global leadership position in the capacitance industry and provide greater access to the european market and customers 
enhanced strategic plan of in july  kemet announced its enhanced strategic plan plan to enhance the company s position as a global leader in passive electronic technologies 
kemet believed that there had been profound changes in the competitive landscape of the electronics industry over the past several years 
the company listened closely to its customers description of their future directions  and aligned kemet s future plans closely with their plans 
building on the company s foundation of success in being the preferred supplier to the world s most successful electronics manufacturers and distributors  kemet began adapting so as to continue to succeed in the new global environment 
kemet s strategy had three foundations enhancing the company s position as the market leader in quality  delivery  and service through outstanding execution  having a global mindset  with an increased emphasis on growing kemet s presence in asia  and accelerating the pace of innovations to broaden the company s product portfolio 
to execute the plan  kemet substantially reorganized its operations around the world 
several kemet facilities were relocated based on access to key customers  access to key technical resources and knowledge  and availability of low cost resources 
kemet recorded special charges of approximately million over the period of the reorganization related to movement of manufacturing operations 
this has yielded an approximate one year payback based on unit volumes at the time of the announcement  and a million savings with volume recovery achieved in fiscal year in addition  there were special charges reflecting the change in status of the facilities that were vacated through this move 
the timing of the special charges was dependent on the timing of operational decisions the company still has two remaining moves  which are scheduled to be completed in fiscal year see fiscal year special charges  fiscal year special charges  and fiscal year special charges under results of operations 
kemet in the united states kemet s corporate headquarters is in greenville  south carolina 
individual functions evolve to support global activities in asia  europe  and north america  either from greenville  south carolina or through locations in appropriate parts of the world 
commodity manufacturing currently in the united states has been substantially relocated to the company s lower cost manufacturing facilities in mexico and china 
there are two remaining moves currently underway which are scheduled to be completed by the end of fiscal year production that remains in the united states will focus primarily on early stage manufacturing of new products and other specialty products for which customers are predominantly located in north america 
to accelerate the pace of innovations  the kemet innovation center was created 
the primary objectives of the innovation center are to ensure the flow of new products and robust manufacturing processes that will keep the company at the forefront of its customers product designs  while enabling these products to be transferred rapidly to the most appropriate kemet manufacturing location in the world for low cost  high volume production 
the main campus of the kemet innovation center is located in greenville  south carolina 
kemet in mexico kemet believes its mexican operations are among the most cost efficient in the world  and they will continue to be the company s primary production facilities supporting north american and some european customers 
one of the strengths of kemet mexico is that it is truly a mexican operation  including mexican management and workers 
these facilities are responsible for maintaining kemet s traditional excellence in quality  service  and delivery  while driving costs down 
the facilities in victoria and matamoros will remain focused primarily on tantalum capacitors  and the facilities in monterrey will continue to support ceramic capacitors 
kemet in china in recent years  low production costs and proximity to large  growing markets have caused many of kemet s key customers to relocate production facilities to asia  particularly china 
kemet has a well established sales and logistics network in asia to support its customers asian operations 
the company s initial china production facility in suzhou near shanghai commenced shipments in the company began shipping products from its second production facility in suzhou in manufacturing operations in china will continue to grow  and kemet anticipates that production capacity in china may be equivalent to mexico in the future 
like kemet mexico  the vision for kemet china is to be a chinese operation  with chinese management and workers  to help achieve kemet s objective of being a global company 
these facilities will be responsible for maintaining kemet s traditional excellence in quality  service  and delivery  while accelerating cost reduction efforts and supporting efforts to grow the company s customer base in asia 
kemet in europe as previously mentioned  the company completed the acquisition of the tantalum business unit of epcos on april  the company also acquired evox rifa group oyj on april  these acquisitions have provided the company with manufacturing operations in europe 
kemet will maintain and enhance its strong european sales and customer service infrastructure  allowing kemet to continue to meet the local preferences of european customers who remain an important focus for kemet going forward 
global sales and logistics in recent years  it has become more complex to do business in the electronics industry 
market leading electronics manufacturers have spread their facilities more globally 
the growth of the electronics manufacturing services ems industry has resulted in a more challenging supply chain 
new asian electronics manufacturers are emerging rapidly 
the most successful business models in the electronics industry are based on tightly integrated supply chain logistics to drive down costs 
kemet s direct salaried sales force worldwide and a well developed global logistics infrastructure distinguish it in the marketplace and will remain a hallmark of kemet in meeting the needs of its global customers 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following identifies a number of policies which require significant judgments or estimates 
the company s estimates and assumptions are based on historical data and other assumptions that kemet believes are reasonable 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
in addition  they affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the judgments are based on management s assessment as to the effect certain estimates  assumptions  or future trends or events may have on the financial condition and results of operations reported in the consolidated financial statements 
it is important that a reader of the financial statements understand that actual future results could differ from these estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
kemet s management believes the following critical accounting policies contain the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out method and market based upon net realizable value 
the valuation of inventories requires management to make estimates 
the company also must assess the prices at which it believes the finished goods inventory can be sold compared to its cost 
a sharp decrease in unit demand could adversely impact earnings as the reserve estimates could increase 
conversely  a sharp increase in unit demand could favorably impact earnings as the reserve estimates could decrease 
during fiscal year  the company renegotiated the contract with cabot corporation associated with the tantalum purchase commitment 
due to the changes made in the contract  a portion of the and purchase commitment losses were reversed 
in the fiscal year ended march   the company decreased its purchase commitment liability by recognizing a gain of million 
as of march   the company had purchased the inventory that was committed to be purchased under the agreement 
the company has assumed a supply agreement with cabot resulting from the acquisition of the epcos tantalum business unit on april  this contract extends through september the company recorded an unfavorable contract provision on its opening balance sheet related to this agreement 
the net realizable value of current tantalum inventory and the losses with respect to future tantalum commitments were calculated based on current market prices for tantalum 
there is no established market on which tantalum raw materials are regularly traded and quoted 
the company based its determination of current market price on quotations from suppliers of these materials 
in quantifying the charges that were recorded against future purchase commitments  the company assumed  for lack of another benchmark  the current market prices would continue through calendar year  when kemet s purchase commitments were scheduled to end 
had other assumptions on current and future prices for tantalum been made  the amount of the inventory losses against purchase commitments would have been different 
asset impairment goodwill and long lived assets 
kemet adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on april  under sfas no 
 goodwill  which represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired  and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized but are to be tested for impairment at least on an annual basis in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
effective october   the company organized into two distinct business units the tantalum business unit and the ceramics business unit 
accordingly  the company had to alter the method which it used to test for goodwill impairment 
the company evaluated its goodwill on a reporting unit basis consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
this required the company to estimate the fair value of the reporting units based on the future net cash flows expected to be generated 
at december   the company determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
the company s goodwill is tested for impairment at least on an annual basis 
the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of its reporting units  as defined under sfas no 
 with carrying amounts 
if the reporting unit s aggregated carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired 
the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit being measured exceeds its fair value  up to the total amount of its assets 
on an ongoing basis  kemet expects to perform its impairment tests during the first quarter of each fiscal year and when otherwise warranted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 kemet completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of fiscal years   and  none of which indicated impairment 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  kemet completed another goodwill impairment test due to the asset impairment the company recorded in that quarter 
see below for a discussion on the fiscal fourth quarter asset impairment 
this test yielded no goodwill impairment 
as of march   kemet had goodwill in the amount of million 
for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  kemet follows the guidance as prescribed in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization would be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
a long lived asset classified as held for sale is initially measured and reported at the lower of its carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until the long lived asset is disposed of 
tests for the recoverability of a long lived asset to be held and used are measured by comparing the carrying amount of the long lived asset to the sum of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows  the company uses future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and which are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these assumptions include  among other estimates  periods of operation  projections of sales  cost of good sold  and capital spending 
changes in any of these estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if it is determined that a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated equal to the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
the fair value is calculated as the discounted cash flows of the underlying assets on a pre tax basis 
using the factors above  a test for recoverability of the company s tantalum and ceramic assets was performed as of march  the results of the test for recoverability indicated that the carrying amount of the long lived assets exceeded the estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
as a result  kemet calculated the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived assets over its fair value on a pre tax discounted cash flow basis using the factors above 
the discount rate used was an estimation of kemet s pre tax  weighted average cost of capital 
the company  accordingly  recognized a non cash impairment charge of million million for tantalum products and million for ceramic products 
the company believed that it was appropriate to record these impairments due to continued erosion in average selling prices which have been greater than historical reductions 
for further discussion  see fiscal year special charges 
future changes in assumptions may negatively impact future valuations 
in future tests for recoverability  adverse changes in undiscounted cash flow assumptions could result in an impairment of certain long lived assets that would require a non cash charge to the consolidated statements of operations and may have a material effect on the company s financial condition and operating results 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue only when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
a portion of sales is related to products designed to meet customer specific requirements 
these products typically have stricter tolerances making them useful to the specific customer requesting the product and to customers with similar or less stringent requirements 
products with customer specific requirements are tested and approved by the customer before the company mass produces and ships the product 
the company recognizes revenue at shipment as the sales terms for products produced with customer specific requirements do not contain a final customer acceptance provision or other provisions that are unique and would otherwise allow the customer different acceptance rights 
a portion of sales is made to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return and price protection on unsold merchandise held by distributors 
the company s distributor policy includes inventory price protection and ship from stock and debit sfsd programs common in the industry 
the price protection policy protects the value of the distributors inventory in the event the company reduces its published selling price to distributors 
this program allows the distributor to debit the company for the difference between kemet s list price and the lower authorized price for specific parts 
the company establishes price protection reserves on specific parts residing in distributors inventories in the period that the price protection is formally authorized by management 
the sfsd program provides a mechanism for the distributor to meet a competitive price after obtaining authorization from the local company sales office 
this program allows the distributor to ship its higher priced inventory and debit the company for the difference between kemet s list price and the lower authorized price for that specific transaction 
the company established reserves for its sfsd program based primarily on certain distributors actual inventory levels comprising to of the total global distributor inventory related to customers which participate in the sfsd program 
the remaining to is estimated based on actual distributor inventory and current sales trends 
management analyzes historical sfsd activity to determine the sfsd exposure on the global distributor inventory at the balance sheet date 
from time to time  the company builds up inventory levels due to factors such as anticipated future demand exceeding capacity and when the company moves manufacturing from one location to another location 
when the distributors build up inventory levels  the estimation of the inventory at the distributors for the remaining to could be estimated at an incorrect amount 
however  the company believes that the difference between the estimate and the ultimate actual amount would be immaterial 
the establishment of these reserves is recognized as a component of the line item net sales on the consolidated statements of operations  while the associated reserves are included in the line item accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheets 
postretirement benefits 
kemet s management  with the assistance of an actuarial firm  performs an actuarial valuation of the fair values of its postretirement plans benefit obligations 
management makes certain assumptions that have a significant effect on the calculated fair value of the obligations such as the weighted average discount rate used to arrive at the net present value of the obligation  salary increases used to calculate the impact future pay increases will have on postretirement obligations  and medical cost inflation used to calculate the impact future medical costs will have on postretirement obligations 
management understands that these assumptions directly impact the actuarial valuation of the obligations recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the income or expense that flows through the consolidated statements of operations 
management bases its assumptions on either historical or market data that it considers reasonable 
variations in these assumptions could have a significant effect on the amounts reported through the consolidated statements of operations 
the company froze accrual of benefits of its domestic non contributory pension plan on june  prior to the end of fiscal year  kemet terminated and liquidated its defined benefit pension plan and  as a result  recognized million in pension settlement charges 
during fiscal year  kemet recognized million of additional costs relating to the final settlement of its defined benefit pension plan 
the termination of the pension plan is anticipated to result in future savings of approximately million per year 
kemet continues to provide other defined contribution retirement plans to its employees 
income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method  as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are recognized to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management believes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred tax assets for the united states  portugal  switzerland  and australia will not be realized  based on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the recent history of cumulative losses  and the insufficient evidence of projected future taxable income to overcome the loss history 
management has provided a valuation allowance related to any benefits from income taxes resulting from the application of a statutory tax rate to the deferred tax assets 
kemet continues to have net deferred tax assets future tax benefits in several other countries which the company expects to realize assuming  based on certain estimates and assumptions  sufficient taxable income in certain foreign tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax benefits 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to reduce the value of the deferred tax assets resulting in additional tax expense 
results of operations historically  revenues and earnings may or may not be representative of future operating results due to various economic and other factors 
the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain of the company s financial data in thousands fiscal years ended march  net sales operating costs and expenses cost of goods sold gain on long term supply contract selling  general and administrative expenses research and development pension settlement charges gain on sale of intellectual property restructuring and impairment charges operating income loss other income and expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year overview net sales net sales for fiscal year were million  which represented a increase from fiscal year net sales of million 
the acquisition of the epcos tantalum business unit resulted in an increase in net sales of in fiscal year sales revenue for the core business increased due to increased sales volumes 
during fiscal year  average selling prices asps remained relatively flat for existing products 
the company also had  new product introductions during fiscal year  of which were first to market 
each of these factors contributed to the increase in core net sales 
cost of good sold cost of goods sold for the fiscal year ended march   was million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended march   a increase 
the increase in cost of goods sold was impacted by the purchase of the epcos tantalum business unit 
new product offerings increased cost of goods sold by 
the company believes many of the actions it initiated or carried out during fiscal years   and see fiscal year special charges  fiscal year special charges  and fiscal year special charges resulted in lower costs and more efficient operations and accounted for the improved gross profit margin in fiscal year in addition  manufacturing throughput increased in fiscal year as higher volumes resulted in the absorption of fixed costs over more units versus fiscal year research and development research and development expenses were million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year these costs reflect the company s continuing commitment to the development and introduction of new ultralow esr tantalums  tantalum face down products and additional case sizes 
ceramics improved its current product offerings by developing flex migration for crack elimination  and also developing a floating electrode design while expanding hi cv offerings 
these advancements extend the company s leading position in certain capacitor technologies 
it is the company s intent to continue to invest at least of net sales in research and development efforts

operating income loss the operating income for the fiscal year ended march   was million compared to a loss of million in the prior year 
the increase in operating income from the prior year was principally from a combination of the aforementioned higher sales levels and manufacturing efficiencies reflected in costs of goods sold 
other income expense other income expense increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to greater foreign currency transaction gains and a gain on sale of an equity investment in fiscal year income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal year was  resulting in a tax expense of million 
this compares to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year that resulted in a tax benefit of million 
the company s tax expense remained lower than the historical average of to due to income sourced in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
the company also recognized a net tax benefit of million from the normal process of evaluating its worldwide tax contingencies 
no tax benefit is recognized for the domestic tax loss for fiscal year due to the establishment of a valuation allowance during fiscal year future fluctuations in the valuation allowance are expected to result in a tax rate below the to historical average

these charges are considered items outside of normal operations  and it is the intent of kemet to provide more information to explain the operating results 
since some of the items are not considered restructuring charges as defined by us generally accepted accounting principles  the company has provided the breakout of us generally accepted accounting principles restructuring and impairment charges and those other charges and adjustments separately 
the company included the costs related to stock options and other share based payments in fiscal year to provide a more suitable comparison to fiscal years and enhance strategic plan of the plan during fiscal year  the company recognized million in costs relating to the plan 
the plan included moving manufacturing operations to lower cost facilities in mexico and china 
as of march   the company had recorded cumulative charges of million in connection with the plan 
the manufacturing moves to lower cost regions are substantially complete 
two manufacturing operation moves still remain to be made which are the anode manufacturing move to mexico  which is currently in progress  and the tantalum polymer manufacturing move to china  which has not yet started 
it is expected that both moves will be completed by the end of fiscal year during the fiscal year ended march   the company recognized a charge of million for a reduction in force primarily in europe and mexico

effect of inflation inflation generally affects the company by increasing the cost of labor  equipment  and raw materials 
the company does not believe that inflation has had any material effect on the company s business over the past three fiscal years except for the following discussion in commodity price risk 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of the company s sales to its customers and operating costs in europe are euro denominated creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
also  a portion of the company s costs in its mexican operations are denominated in mexican pesos  creating an exposure to foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize its exposure  the company will periodically enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in which the future cash flows in the euro or mexican peso are hedged against the us dollar 
at march   the company had open foreign exchange contracts to purchase mexican pesos with a notional amount of million 
these contracts had a fair value of million at this date 
the company did not have any euro foreign exchange contracts outstanding at march  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of changes in the relationship of other currencies to the us dollar has historically not been significant  and such changes in the future are not expected to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments if there is no underlying business transaction supporting or related to the derivative financial instrument 
commodity price risk the company purchases various precious metals used in the manufacture of capacitors and is therefore exposed to certain commodity price risks 
these precious metals consist primarily of palladium and tantalum 
palladium is a precious metal used in the manufacture of multilayer ceramic capacitors and is mined primarily in russia and south africa 
currently  the company uses forward contracts and spot buys to secure the acquisition of palladium and manage the price volatility in the market 
the company is also aggressively pursuing ways to reduce palladium usage in ceramic capacitors in order to minimize the price risk 
tantalum powder is a metal used in the manufacture of tantalum capacitors 
management believes the tantalum needed has generally been available in sufficient quantities to meet manufacturing requirements 
however  sharp increases in demand for tantalum capacitors may lead to increases in tantalum prices  and tantalum powder availability  as seen in when tantalum raw material price increased from under per pound to over per pound 
the average price of tantalum raw material at march  was over per pound 
although limited  additional suppliers have emerged in the market 
this fact  along with the company s effort to broaden qualified suppliers should minimize its commodity price risk exposure 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of charges related to a tantalum inventory purchase commitment that exceeded market prices 
due to the renegotiation of a tantalum inventory purchase agreement  the company recorded a gain on the purchase commitment of million during fiscal year see critical accounting policies and long term supply agreement
