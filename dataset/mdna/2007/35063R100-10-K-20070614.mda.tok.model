restatement of previously issued financial statements in june  our board of directors formed a special committee of the audit committee special committee to conduct an independent review of our historical stock option granting practices 
on september   we announced that i the special committee had preliminarily concluded that the actual accounting measurement dates for certain stock option grants likely differed from the recorded grant dates for such awards  and ii we had concluded that the financial statements issued by us relating to periods beginning on or after january  should not be relied upon 
on january   we announced the conclusion of the special committee s investigation and its findings 
we also announced that our financial statements for the fiscal years through would be restated 
as a result of the independent investigation  our management has concluded  and the audit committee of the board of directors agrees  that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior periods 
therefore  we have recorded additional stock based compensation

our inquiry into our historical stock option granting practices was voluntary and began as an internal review in may in response to a report by the center for financial research and analysis entitled options backdating which companies are at risk that identified foundry as a company with a moderate risk of options backdating 
in june  the audit committee concluded that  given the preliminary findings of the internal review to date  it would be appropriate for us to conduct a formal and independent investigation of our option granting practices and a special committee of the audit committee was formed to oversee the investigation 
the special committee retained independent counsel to conduct a comprehensive internal investigation of our historical stock option grant practices  who in turn retained forensic accountants to assist them 
throughout the course of the investigation  the special committee s independent advisers reported directly to the special committee  comprised of a single independent director  alan earhart  who joined our board of directors in and has never served on our compensation committee 
the scope of the special committee s investigation was extensive  and included the review of all stock option grants during the period from our september  initial public offering through may in september  we announced that i the special committee had preliminarily concluded that the actual accounting measurement dates for certain stock option grants likely differed from the recorded grant dates for such awards  and ii we had concluded that the financial statements issued by us relating to periods beginning on or after january  should not be relied upon 
in january  we announced the conclusion of the special committee s investigation and its findings  which were set forth in our current report on form k filed on january  we also announced that our financial statements for the fiscal years through would be restated as a result of the independent investigation  our management has concluded  and the audit committee agrees  that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for certain stock option grants made in prior periods 
therefore  we have recorded additional stock based compensation expense and related tax effects with regard to past stock option grants  and we are restating previously filed financial statements in this annual report on form k

they represent the net change to cost of product and service revenue by year based on the compensation cost incurred as a result of the restatement and the respective inventory turnover in each affected period 
findings of the special committee 
the special committee reviewed the facts and circumstances surrounding stock option grants 
the special committee s advisors collectively spent over  hours searching more than three million pages of both physical and electronic documents and conducted more than interviews of current and former directors  officers  employees  consultants and legal counsel to foundry 
based on its investigation  the special committee has concluded  among other things  that we lack contemporaneous evidence supporting a substantial number of the recorded option grants  and that some stock option grants were determined with the benefit of hindsight 
in some instances  documents  data and interviews suggest that the option grant was prepared or finalized days or  in some cases  weeks after the option grant date recorded in our books 
the affected grants include grants to existing employees  newly hired employees  officers and directors 
the special committee found that in a substantial number of cases  our president and chief executive officer  bobby johnson  jr  selected the grant dates for and approved option awards after the grant dates recorded in our books 
however  mr 
johnson did not receive any options in connection with these grants 
further  the special committee found no evidence demonstrating that mr 
johnson was advised that our stock option granting practices had resulted or would result in a misstatement of our financial results 
the special committee also found that although our former vice president  finance and administration and chief financial officer  timothy d 
heffner  did not select grant dates  he was involved in the option granting process by  among other things  communicating option grants determined by mr 
johnson to our stock option administrators and human resources group 
based on the evidence and findings from our internal review and the special committee s independent investigation  we analyzed the measurement dates for all stock option grants awarded from the time of our initial public offering in september through may review period 
we believe that the special committee s analysis was properly limited to the review period 
in addition to analyzing all grants made during the review period  we reviewed stock option grants that were recorded between our date of inception  on may   and the date of our initial public offering  on september   and found none that required accounting adjustments 
the first option granting action for which an adjustment to stock based compensation expense is required is dated september  we also examined grants that were made after the review period and found none that 
table of contents required accounting adjustments 
in july  we made significant changes in our stock option granting practices  and we have determined that our current equity award processes and procedures are appropriate and appropriately controlled 
impact of judgments and interpretations on restatement values 
in calculating the amount of incremental stock based compensation expense that we are required to record under generally accepted accounting principles  we made certain interpretations and assumptions and drew certain conclusions from and regarding the internal investigation findings 
these interpretations  assumptions and conclusions may be subject to later dispute 
there is also a risk that the investigation findings themselves may later be determined to be inaccurate or incomplete 
these risks are particularly acute where documentation was incomplete 
where we had incomplete documentation  we considered  among other things  the guidance provided by the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission sec  pursuant to a letter dated september  chief accountant s letter 
specifically  the chief accountant s letter states that companies such as ours should use all reasonably available relevant information to form reasonable conclusions as to the most likely option granting actions that occurred and the dates on which such actions occurred in determining the parameters of the restatement 
we made certain legal interpretations regarding  among other things  the requirements under delaware law for the granting of stock options  the effectiveness of actions taken by our board of directors and certain of its committees  and the effectiveness and effect of granting actions by written consent 
we also made a number of accounting interpretations  including interpreting various sec staff views and applying those interpretations to our facts and circumstances 
for example  we interpreted and applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations to each category of granting actions discussed below 
we were required to make a determination of the correct measurement date  which under apb is defined as the first date on which are known both the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to receive and the option or purchase price  if any 
as previously noted  we also considered the guidance provided by the chief accountant s letter in making our determinations 
underlying the entire restatement are the investigation findings by the special committee 
we had to make many assumptions and conclusions in reviewing the evidence presented to us by the special committee  including assumptions regarding the veracity of witnesses  the intent behind the wording of certain documents  particularly informal communications such as emails and the state of mind of persons involved in the granting process 
we believe that the special committee was thorough in its investigation and we had access to the results of its investigation 
our process for making these assumptions and reaching these conclusions was systematic and involved interaction among the special committee  the audit committee and the current management team 
consistent with the current accounting literature and published guidance from the staff of the sec  we organized option grants awarded during the review period into categories based on the type of granting action that occurred and the process by which a grant was finalized 
we analyzed the available evidence related to each category of grants  including electronic and physical documents  document metadata electronically recorded information about the creation or editing of documents  and witness interviews 
based on relevant facts and circumstances  we applied the applicable accounting standards to determine a measurement date for every grant within each category 
where documentation was incomplete  our approach was to identify as the measurement date the earlier of a the date the grant was reported to the board of directors or b the date the grant was entered into our equity accounting database 
if the measurement date was other than the originally recorded grant date  we made accounting adjustments as required  resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects 
from our inception in until june   the board of directors awarded stock options either at a duly convened meeting or by unanimous written consent uwc 
beginning june   the board of directors authorized mr 
johnson  acting as a sole member stock option committee of the board of directors stock option committee to grant options to eligible employees who were not executive officers or directors of foundry 
these stock option committee approvals were documented in written actions soc actions 
grants to executive officers continued to be made principally by the board of directors  either at a duly held meeting or by uwc  however  from september through may  the compensation committee awarded stock options  principally to executive officers  on three dates 
grants to board members were made either under the self executing provisions of the directors option plan  or by the board of directors at a duly held meeting or by uwc 
in 
table of contents july  the board of directors transferred the responsibilities of the stock option committee to the compensation committee and directed it to administer all grants of stock or stock options to all employees  including officers 
we awarded stock options or other equity based compensation through granting actions occurring on separate dates during the review period 
the grants are aggregated by granting action as follows ten granting actions related to persons elected or appointed to the board of directors director grants  granting actions related to newly hired employees and routine employee promotion or bonus grants end of month grants  granting actions made in connection with broad based awards to non officer employees for retention purposes employee retention grants  granting actions for awards to officers and other executive employees officer grants  including three granting actions for awards to our chief executive officer ceo grants  and one granting action deemed modified by our august tender offer 
as discussed below  we determined that the originally recorded grant dates for granting actions cannot be supported as the proper measurement dates 
accordingly  after accounting for forfeitures  cancellation  vesting acceleration and other related adjustments  we have recognized stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the vesting periods of the awards 
no adjustments were required for the remaining granting actions 
the judgments applied  the respective adjustments made  and our assessment of the possible range of amounts of compensation expense that would have been recorded if different judgments had been applied  are summarized by grant category below director grants during the review period  we had ten granting actions including stock option awards to non employee directors 
approximately million of pre tax stock based compensation expense has been recorded as a result of revised measurement dates in connection with these director grants 
eight director grants were automatic grants under the provisions of the directors stock option plan  which required no accounting adjustments 
two were director grants awarded for retention purposes pursuant to the stock plan and documented in actions by uwc that were dated effective as of february  and february   respectively 
the special committee found that there was inadequate documentation to support the originally recorded dates of these two grants 
the price of our common stock on the corrected measurement date for the february  grant was lower than the original option exercise price 
the february  grant was deemed repriced and variable accounting was applied 
the board of directors directed that the latter grant be re priced to reflect the higher exercise price  and has decided not to re price the former grant to the lower exercise price 
our current non management directors who exercised re priced options have repaid us the net after tax difference between the initial exercise price and the corrected exercise price approximately  in the aggregate 
because judgment was used in establishing one of the revised measurement dates  we performed a sensitivity analysis around potential alternative measurement dates 
we developed a range of possible earlier alternative measurement dates for that grant  using the original grant date as the beginning of that range because we did not find any evidence to support a different date for the beginning of the range 
we assessed the fluctuation in our stock price if a different measurement date between the original grant date and the revised measurement date had been used  and determined that if an earlier measurement date had been selected based on the highest price of our common stock between february  and april   the total stock based compensation charge would have been approximately million higher 
there was no lower price in the range that would have caused the total stock based compensation charge for this grant to be lower 
we believe that our approach was the most appropriate under the circumstances 
end of month grants end of month grants during the review period included granting actions  of which were revised and resulted in approximately million of cumulative pre tax compensation expense 

table of contents we regularly used the last trading day of the month as the grant date for employee new hire grants and employee promotion bonus grants 
we refer to these as end of month grants for classification purposes even though some grants were not recorded on the last trading day of the month 
the end of month grant process was observed in a large majority of cases 
however  because of variations in practice we concluded that it could not be established as a practice that would serve as the basis for determining appropriate accounting measurement dates for these granting actions 
our end of month grants were documented in written actions of the soc which generally were prepared shortly after month end  although in most cases there is no contemporaneous evidence to identify the specific date 
the grants were subsequently entered into the stock option database  on average days after month end  although the timing varied 
as a result  we determined that in the absence of other contemporaneous evidence indicating that the terms of awards to individual recipients were known with finality at an earlier date measurement dates for respective granting actions involving new hire grants and employee promotion bonus grants are the earlier of a the date the majority of such grants were entered into our equity accounting database representing of the granting actions revised or b other evidence  such as email correspondence providing the first finalized documentation of the individual recipient s share allocation or the date of the board of directors meeting during which management reported the award of such grants as documented in the minutes of that meeting representing of the granting actions revised 
we have concluded that of the end of month granting actions require adjustment to their recorded dates 
because judgment was used in establishing the revised measurement dates  we performed a sensitivity analysis around the potential alternative measurement dates 
we developed a range of possible earlier alternative measurement dates for those grants  using the original grant date as the beginning of that range because we did not find any evidence to support a different date for the beginning of the range 
we assessed the fluctuation in our stock price if a different measurement date between the original grant date and the revised measurement date had been used  and determined that if an earlier measurement date had been selected based on the highest price of our common stock in this period  the total stock based compensation charge would have been approximately million higher 
had we used the lowest closing price of our stock within the range resulting from the above methodology for each grant  our total restated stock based compensation adjustment relating to the revision in measurement dates would have decreased by approximately million 
we believe that our approach was the most appropriate under the circumstances 
employee retention grants during the review period  we had a total of employee retention granting actions  of which required revised measurement dates and resulted in approximately million of cumulative pre tax compensation expense 
these employee retention grants were typically made on an annual basis as part of an extensive process that required several weeks to complete 
pursuant to formulae  guidelines and practices established by an executive team and led by our ceo the sole member of the stock option committee  managers throughout the company would make recommendations for grants to employees in their areas of responsibility 
after the ceo had determined that the recommended grants were in accordance with established formulae  guidelines and practices  we treated the grants as final 
our practice was that employee retention grants were generally awarded by the stock option committee 
for employee retention grants  the number of shares that some employees were entitled to receive was not determined with finality on the stated grant dates or we were unable to find contemporaneous documentary support that the proper approval of the grant had been given on the stated grant dates 
documentary evidence such as email messages and grant allocation lists generated by our human resources department showed that for these grants  which typically were made to a large portion of the employee population  either grantee names or stock option amounts were still subject to change on the stated grant date and were not finalized until a subsequent date 
as a result  a revised measurement date for the entire granting action was required 
for five additional employee retention grants  contemporaneous documentary evidence indicated that the list of grantee names and share amounts was finalized on the stated grant date and only the names or amounts of a small number of stragglers were added after the stated grant date 
for these we determined that the original measurement date was appropriate for all but the grants made to the stragglers 
the grants to stragglers were deemed to be part of a separate granting action and  accordingly  revised using a subsequent date that was supported by the best available contemporaneous 
table of contents documentary evidence 
one additional employee retention grant was determined to have been repriced and variable accounting was applied 
as a result  we determined that in the absence of other contemporaneous evidence indicating that the terms of awards to individual recipients were known with finality at an earlier date measurement dates for respective granting actions involving employee retention grants are the earlier of a the date the majority of such grants were entered into our equity accounting database representing of the granting actions revised or b the dates of board meetings documented in minutes  email evidence  or lists of finalized shares and recipients provided to our human resources department representing nine of the granting actions revised 
because judgment was used in establishing the revised measurement dates  we performed a sensitivity analysis around potential alternative measurement dates 
we developed a range of possible earlier alternative measurement dates for those grants  using the original grant date as the beginning of that range in all but two cases where email evidence supported a different date for the beginning of the range 
we assessed the fluctuation in our stock price if a different measurement date between the beginning date of the range and the revised measurement date had been used  and determined that if an earlier measurement date had been selected based on the highest price of our common stock in this period  total stock based compensation charge would have been approximately million higher 
had we used the lowest closing price of our stock within the range resulting from the above methodology for each grant  our total restated stock based compensation adjustment relating to the revision in measurement dates would have decreased by approximately million 
we believe that our approach was the most appropriate under the circumstances 
officer grants during the review period  we had granting actions that were awards of stock options to officers and other executive employees when they were hired  promoted or earned a bonus  and for purposes of retention 
as a result of revising measurement dates for seven of these granting actions  approximately million of cumulative pre tax compensation expense was recorded 
terms of new hire  promotion or bonus  and retention grants to officers  which we refer to as officer grants  were generally consistent with the terms of grants awarded for similar purposes to non executive employees 
officer grants were awarded by the compensation committee or the board of directors  and documented either in meeting minutes or uwc 
we determined that the measurement dates used for officer grants in   and were supported by contemporaneous documentary evidence 
in august  form filing deadlines were shortened and there were no revised officer grants after this date 
we determined that  in connection with some officer grants that we made during fiscal years  and  the number of shares that an individual officer was entitled to receive was not determined with finality on stated grant dates or we were unable to find contemporaneous documentary support that the proper approval of the related stock option grant had been given on stated grant dates 
our former chief financial officer who exercised re priced options has repaid us the net after tax difference between the initial exercise price and the corrected exercise price approximately  and has agreed to re price any unexercised options which he holds that are being revised to reflect the price of our common stock on the new measurement dates 
as a result  we determined that in the absence of other contemporaneous evidence indicating that the terms of awards to individual recipients were known with finality at an earlier date measurement dates for respective granting actions involving officer grants are the earlier of a the date the majority of such grants were entered into our equity accounting database representing one of the seven granting actions revised or b the dates of faxed signature pages for uwcs  e mail evidence  or dates of board of directors meetings  as documented in the minutes of those meetings representing six of the seven granting actions revised 
because judgment was used in establishing the revised measurement dates  we performed a sensitivity analysis around potential alternative measurement dates 
we developed a range of possible earlier alternative measurement dates for those grants  using the original grant date as the beginning of that range because we did not find any evidence to support a different date for the beginning of the range 
we assessed the fluctuation in our stock price if a different measurement date between the original grant date the revised measurement date had been used  and determined that if earlier measurement dates had been selected based on the highest price of our common stock in this period  total stock based compensation charge would have been approximately million higher 
had we used the lowest closing price of our stock within the range resulting from the above methodology for each grant  our total restated stock based compensation adjustment relating to the revision in measurement dates would have decreased by approximately million 
we believe that our approach was the most appropriate under the circumstances 

table of contents ceo grants during the review period  we had three granting actions involving stock option grants to mr 
johnson  our ceo 
one award  dated august   was a stock option for  shares that was presented and approved at a regular meeting of the board of directors on that same date 
a second award  dated january   was a stock option for  shares and an award of  restricted shares that was presented and approved at a regular meeting of the board of directors on that date 
the third grant  dated june   was a stock option to purchase  shares that was approved by the board of directors at its march  meeting  together with grants to other executive officers 
the exercise price of this option was established as the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market on or about the date of our annual stockholder meeting  with the determination of the specific date for this option and the other executives options left in the discretion of mr 
johnson 
we have concluded that no adjustment is required for any of these granting actions 
grant modified by tender offer on august   we commenced a stock option exchange program for our employees  under which employees excluding officers and directors were given the opportunity to voluntarily cancel unexercised vested and unvested stock options previously granted to them in exchange for a stock option grant equal to times the number of tendered options on or about march  pursuant to the tender offer rules  participants who elected to exchange any options were also required to exchange any other options granted to the participant in the six months prior to august  on march   we issued options to purchase  shares of common stock to employees who participated in the tender offer which was net of shares forfeited by terminating employees  at an exercise price of per share  in exchange for options to purchase  shares of common stock that were tendered by september  we determined that the list of grantees for the employee retention grant recorded on february  was not finalized on that date 
as a result  this  share grant was revised with a new grant date of march  contemporaneous evidence clearly showed that the revised measurement date fell within the six month look back period prior to the date of the tender offer consummation 
since any stock options granted to tender participants in the six month look back period were subject to modification by the tender offer  variable accounting is required to be applied to certain of the untendered options 
as a result  we recognized additional compensation expense of million  related to  of the march  untendered options 
we did not assess a possible range of amounts of compensation expense for this grant based on alternate measurement dates  because there were no earlier alternative measurement dates that would have impacted these untendered options 
the remaining  stock options from the original employee retention grant have been determined to be fixed options with a revised measurement date of march  variable accounting treatment is not applied to these shares because i the holders did not participate in the tender offer or ii the stock options the holders were awarded as part of the employee retention grant exceeded the number of stock options that were deemed repriced through the tender offer 
all references to the number of option shares  option exercise prices and share prices have been adjusted for stock splits 

table of contents we recorded additional stock based compensation expense and related changes  including tax effects  as a result of these adjustments for past stock option grants discussed above 
these adjustments  shown both before and after tax are as follows in millions total director grants end of month grants employee retention grants officer grants ceo grants grant modified by tender offer other  net pre tax stock based compensation expense adjustments income tax benefit expense net stock based compensation expense benefit adjustments other  net represents related employment tax charges and other stock based compensation charges 
includes the following amounts attributable to the impact of variable accounting        million   million   million   million  total  million 
we determined that as a result of revised measurement  eleven granting actions required both a revised measurement date and the application of variable accounting 
generally  variable accounting resulted because strong evidence indicated that the grant was approved at an earlier date often a board of directors meeting 
however  the granting action was not recorded at that date  and was instead recorded at a subsequent grant date at a lower price than the earlier date that we subsequently determined to be when the grant was originally awarded 
as a result of the restatement  we recognized million  after tax  of stock based compensation expense through fiscal  and had approximately million of deferred stock based compensation expense to be amortized as of december  as described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to consolidated financial statements  on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
as required by sfas r  the unamortized deferred compensation expense of million at january  has been reclassified to additional paid in capital 
the impact of recognizing additional stock compensation and other adjustments on each component of stockholders equity at the end of each year is summarized as follows in millions common stock additional deferred stock net impact to fiscal year paid in capital compensation retained earnings stockholders equity subtotal total 
table of contents tax impact of restatement items in connection with the restatement of our consolidated financial statements due to stock option adjustments  we recorded deferred tax benefits on the non cash stock based compensation expense over the option vesting periods for grants to individuals who were employed in tax jurisdictions where a tax deduction was available 
the tax impact of the restatement for stock based compensation expense reduced increased the tax provision for fiscal years ended december       and by million  million  million  million  million  million and million respectively 
the aggregate reduction in tax provision of million resulted in a million restatement  net of taxes 
in addition  we determined that  in connection with the restated stock based compensation expense  a related expense for employment taxes should have been recorded in the amount of approximately  we recorded this expense in the period of exercise because employers have an obligation to withhold taxes from employees upon the exercise of nonqualified stock options  and the employer s liability for taxes is joint and several along with the employee 
the liability was subsequently released in the period the respective statute of limitation lapsed 
internal revenue code section m limits the deductibility of compensation in excess of million that is not performance based and that is paid to the chief executive officer and the four other named executive officers in our annual proxy statement 
in the year in which any such officers exercise options that have been revised as a result of our investigation we may have compensation expense for which we are not able to take a corresponding tax deduction 
we are not able to predict the likelihood of this tax benefit limitation on deductibility of our compensation expense in the future 
stock based compensation expense for non qualified stock options including incentive stock options deemed to be non qualified as a result of the re measurement was assumed to be deductible at the time of exercise  subject to limitations under section m and local country law 
because virtually all holders of options issued by us were neither involved in nor aware of the company s accounting treatment of stock options  we have taken and intend to take actions to deal with certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after december  may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under internal revenue code section a and  as applicable  similar penalty taxes under california and other state tax laws 
we expect to record approximately million in operating expense in future periods in relation to these items and other tax related items 
in the restated consolidated financial statements  we recorded deferred tax assets for stock compensation expense attributable to non qualified stock options 
the deferred tax assets were recognized in the statement of income in accordance with the applicable vesting periods of the non qualified stock options 
to the extent actual events were inconsistent with the initial assumptions and tax benefits were not ultimately realized  we reversed the recorded tax benefits in the year in which such events occurred 
when options were cancelled or expired unexercised  recorded tax benefits were reversed to additional paid in capital to the extent of previous credits to additional paid in capital for excess tax benefits  and then to the income tax provision 
business environment during  we saw continued improvement in the macro economic environment 
despite the challenging federal spending environment in the first half of  we saw solid growth in our commercial business throughout the year 
during  we benefited from a continuation of a broad enterprise upgrade cycle  which began in late  as customers continued preparing their network infrastructure for voice over internet protocol voip  wireless applications  and the adoption of gbe in the network core to accommodate higher levels of traffic 
in addition  we experienced renewed service provider interest in our new router product offerings  the xmr and mlx family of mpls routers 
the networking market has been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
our revenue has generally been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion  increases in market share and the release of new products 
however  our revenue growth has been hindered by declining prices and competitive 
table of contents pressures 
the market for data networking products continues to be dominated by cisco  with over share of the networking market 
we continue to invest in our core market and adjacent markets in which the competitive landscape looks attractive and the growth prospects are promising 
although we expect our revenue to grow in  there can be no assurance that the networking market will continue to improve or that we will be successful in executing on our growth strategy 
financial performance marked our th anniversary and the sixth year that we have operated profitably in the seven years since we went public in september our total net revenue for increased to million from million in due to the increased breadth and depth of the solutions we are now delivering to both the service provider and enterprise markets and the expansion of our sales organization 
net income in was million  or of total net revenue  compared to million  or of total net revenue  in our profitability in was reduced by an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of million  increased professional and legal fees associated with the restatement of our prior period financial statements of million and pre tax litigation settlement expenses and associated legal fees of million 
our balance sheet remains debt free  with cash and investments of million  an increase of million from during  we generated million of cash from operations and received million of cash from issuances of common stock 
in the fourth quarter of our annualized revenue per employee increased to approximately  during our book to bill ratio  the ratio of new orders received compared to revenue recognized continued to be greater than one 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  current economic conditions  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates that can have a significant effect on our results of operations and the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of foundry s board of directors 
these and other significant accounting policies are more fully described in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate the majority of our revenue from sales of stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remainder of our revenue primarily coming from customer support fees 
we generally sell to direct end users and value added resellers 
we apply the principles of sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition and recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
it is our practice to identify an end user prior to shipment to a value added reseller 

table of contents product revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment  unless an acceptance period or other contingency exists  in which case revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period  or upon satisfaction of the contingency 
support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the support arrangement  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
when sales arrangements contain multiple elements eg  hardware  extended warranty  we apply the provisions of eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  to determine the separate units of accounting that exist within the arrangement 
if more than one unit of accounting exists  the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting using either the relative fair value method or the residual fair value method as prescribed by eitf revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting when the revenue recognition criteria described above have been met for that unit of accounting 
the application of eitf involves significant judgment 
for example  we use judgment to determine whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for undelivered item s in an arrangement 
the timing of revenue recognition varies based on this determination 
at the time product revenue is recognized  we estimate the amount of warranty costs to be incurred and record the amount as a cost of revenue 
our standard warranty period extends one to five years from the date of sale for hardware  depending on the type of product purchased 
our estimate of the amount necessary to settle warranty claims is based primarily on our past experience 
although we believe our estimate is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  actual warranty costs could differ materially from our estimate 
if actual warranty costs are greater than initially estimated  our cost of revenue could increase in the future 
we also provide a provision for estimated customer returns at the time product revenue is recognized 
our provision is based primarily on historical sales returns and our return policies 
our resellers generally do not have a right of return  and our contracts with original equipment manufacturers only provide for rights of return in the event our products do not meet specifications or there is an epidemic failure  as defined in the contracts 
if the historical data used by us to calculate estimated sales returns does not reasonably approximate future returns  revenue in future periods could be affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts customers are subject to a credit review process  through which we evaluate the customer s financial condition and ability to pay based on credit rating services such as dun and bradstreet 
customers are generally assigned a credit limit that may be increased only after a successful collection history has been established 
we do not have significant billing or collection problems 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables and actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or significant deterioration in financial condition 
we estimate allowances for doubtful accounts for all other customers based on factors such as current economic and industry trends  the extent to which receivables are past due  and historical collection experience 
if circumstances change  estimates regarding the collectibility of receivables would be adjusted 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring certain international customers to provide letters of credit or bank guarantees prior to placing an order with us 
although we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate and that the judgment we apply is appropriate  our actual amount of bad debt could differ materially from our estimates 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
our inventory purchases and commitments are made based on anticipated demand for our products  as estimated by management  and our expected service requirements 
we perform an assessment of our inventory each quarter  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycles and development plans  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we estimate the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand and make adjustments to record 
table of contents inventory at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value 
once inventory has been written down to the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value  it is reflected on our balance sheet at its new carrying cost until it is sold or otherwise disposed 
we use contract manufacturers to assemble and test our products 
we also utilize third party oems to manufacture certain foundry branded products 
in order to reduce manufacturing lead times and ensure an adequate supply of inventories  our agreements with some of these manufacturers allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based on rolling production forecasts provided by us 
we may be contractually obligated to purchase long lead time component inventory procured by certain manufacturers in accordance with our forecasts although we can generally give notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
in addition  we issue purchase orders to our component suppliers that may not be cancelable at any time 
as of december   we had approximately million of open purchase orders with our component suppliers and third party manufacturers that may not be cancelable 
if actual demand for our products is below the level assumed in our production forecasts  we may have excess inventory or a liability as a result of our purchase commitments 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r and apply the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method effective january  we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of employee stock based compensatory awards  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
we use a combination of historical and implied volatilities to derive expected volatility 
expected life was derived using the average midpoint between vesting periods and the contractual term  as described in sab we may change our volatility assumption in the future if management believes it will generate a more representative estimate of fair value 
further  as required under sfas r  we must estimate forfeitures for stock based awards that are not expected to vest 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future if factors change and we use different assumptions 
the estimated fair value  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  is charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally one to five years for our stock option grants and restricted stock grants and up to two years for our employee stock purchase plan 
the impact of adopting sfas r is disclosed in note  summary of significant accounting policies to consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether valuation allowances should be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
management assesses the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized against projected future taxable income or our ability to generate taxable income from specific sources  and to the extent that realization is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
in the event we determine that we are unable to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would be necessary  resulting in a charge to income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
income taxes we are audited by various taxing authorities from time to time  and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged and that it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit 
we evaluate these 
table of contents reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies under sfas  accounting for contingencies 
in accordance with sfas r  we recorded a deferred tax benefit on certain stock based awards associated with our stock based compensation plans  including nonqualified stock options  but under current accounting standards we cannot record a deferred tax benefit on costs associated with incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares qualified stock options 
for qualified stock options  we record tax benefit only in the period when disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock occur 
accordingly  as we cannot record the tax benefit for stock based compensation expense associated with qualified stock options until the occurrence of future disqualifying dispositions of the underlying stock  our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates will be subject to greater volatility and  consequently  our ability to estimate reasonably our future quarterly and annual effective tax rates is adversely affected 
in accordance with sfas r  we recorded a net deferred tax asset for the book compensation expense related to non qualified stock options  which was approximately million as of december  to the extent the deferred tax benefit is more than the actual tax benefit realized  the difference may impact the income tax expense if the company does not have a sufficient hypothetical apic pool under sfas r to decrease additional paid in capital 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies in the normal course of our business  in addition to those related to intellectual property and securities litigation 
a loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we continually reassess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  and will recognize a liability  if any  for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts

 accounting for compensated absences eitf 
paragraph of statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences sfas  requires accrual of a liability for compensated absences when certain criteria are met  including a requirement that the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate 
the eitf reached a consensus that an employee s right to a compensated absence under a sabbatical or similar benefit arrangement does accumulate pursuant to sfas and  therefore  a liability for the benefit should be accrued over the period required for the employee to earn the right to the time off under the arrangement 
the guidance in this consensus is to be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently record expense for sabbatical leaves at the point in time that employees have met the sabbatical service requirements  not over the period required for employees to earn the right to a sabbatical 
in the first quarter of  we will adopt eitf through a cumulative effect adjustment 
this will result in a reduction to retained earnings of approximately  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our future financial results

results of operations net revenue we offer products in two configuration platforms  a fixed configuration stackable and a flexible configuration chassis 
a stackable has a fixed configuration that cannot be altered 
a chassis uses a modular platform that can be populated and reconfigured with various management and line card modules as frequently as desired by the customer 
for example  customers can use our chassis products at the edge of their network and then reconfigure the chassis to be used in the mission critical backbone or core of their network 
our selling prices and gross margins on chassis based products are generally higher than our stackable products because of the flexible configuration offered by chassis based products 
net revenue information is as follows dollars in thousands year ended december  percentage change of net of net of net revenue revenue revenue to to net revenue product service total net revenue chassis stackable total net product revenue net product revenue in increased from due to a general improvement in both the enterprise and service provider markets coupled with increased customer acceptance of our new switching and routing platforms and the expansion of our sales organization 
during the course of we grew our sales personnel from at december  to at december  net product revenue from our chassis based products increased in as compared to due to customer acceptance of our new rx  superx platforms for the enterprise market and xmr mlx platforms for the service provider market 
revenue for reflects our first full year of sales of our xmr and mlx product offerings 
due to the strength of our new chassis based platforms  stackable products represented of our total net revenue in  down from in sales to the united states government accounted for approximately of total net revenue for  down from for  but increased in terms of absolute dollars by to million in from million in we expect our net product revenues to continue to increase in the next year as we continue to hire additional sales personnel and gain increased productivity from the sales personnel we have recently hired 
net product revenue in decreased from  due to weaker than expected demand for networking equipment in the first half of we believe our commercial customers became more cautious about their own business outlook towards the end of due to a number of factors  including lack of visibility into their own future results and concerns about their business prospects in in addition  our united states government 
table of contents business declined significantly during the first half of as the government realigned its it spending priorities 
during the nd half of  product sales gradually improved 
however  we continued to experience reductions in overall average selling prices resulting from a shift in product mix towards lower priced stackable products and competitive pricing pressure 
revenue in reflected our first full year of sales of our lower priced gbe fastiron edge stackable switches  which  at the time  offered a similar feature set as our small end chassis but at a lower price point 
through our gigabit stackable switches gained strong customer acceptance and continue to increase as a percentage of product revenue 
stackable products generated of our total net revenue in  versus in sales to the united states government represented of our total revenue in  down from in service revenue consists primarily of revenue from customer support contracts 
the increase in absolute dollars in and were due to a larger installed base of our networking equipment each year as customers purchased new support contracts with their new equipment purchases and renewed maintenance contracts on existing equipment 
we added approximately  new customers in and an additional  new customers in we expect service revenues in the next year  as a percentage of net product revenues to be approximately the same as we manage our business based on four geographic regions the americas primarily the united states  europe  the middle east  and africa emea  japan  and asia pacific 
because some of our customers  such as the united states government and multinational companies  span various geographic locations  we determine revenue by geographic region based on the billing location of the customer 
net product revenue by region as a percentage of net product revenue was as follows americas emea japan asia pacific net product sales in for each of the four regions remained approximately the same from as a percentage of net product revenue 
the shift in product sales from americas to japan in was due to the increased investment in our japanese sales infrastructure and an expansion of our partner channels during  compared to for the years ended december   and  no customers accounted for or more of our net product revenue 
gross margins the following table presents gross margins and gross margin percentages for product and service revenue dollars in thousands year ended december  gross gross gross margin margin margin restated restated gross margins product service total gross margin see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  to consolidated financial statements 
our cost of product revenue consists primarily of materials  labor  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
the decrease in product gross margins as a percentage of net product revenue from to were primarily due to an increase of in material and labor cost  which 
table of contents includes an increase of million from stock based compensation expense 
the average material cost per unit increased in as compared to  while the average selling price increased only in as compared to the xmr mlx and rx platforms are in the early stages of the product life cycle  as such  the material costs were higher than projected but should improve as we gain the benefits of volume production and a better mix between line cards and chassis 
we expect our product gross margins to remain at approximately the same level through fiscal product gross margins  as a percentage of product revenue  decreased in as a result of continued selling price erosion  increased inventory provisions  primarily as a result of a product transition  and a shift in product mix to lower priced stackable products 
during  we transitioned from our fourth generation jetcore based products to our fifth generation terabit capacity products  the bigiron rx and fastiron superx gbe switches 
as a result of the product transition  inventory provisions for our older products increased and average selling prices decreased as we discounted the older product lines 
product inventory provisions were million in  and million in  and million in our cost of service revenue consists primarily of costs related to providing services under customer support contracts  including the costs of logistics and maintaining adequate spares inventory levels at service depots 
service costs include material costs  labor  and overhead 
service gross margins remained flat at in primarily due to higher service revenues offsetting the increased investment in our service infrastructure 
we expect service gross margins to experience variability over time due to the timing of order bookings for both new support arrangements and renewals  costs of stocking adequate spares inventory  and additional investments in infrastructure to support our customers 
service gross margins increased in primarily due to lower spares inventory provisions and favorable pricing variances on certain service inventory components in we expect service gross margins to experience variability over time due to the timing of technical support initiations and renewals  spares inventory levels  and additional investments in our customer support infrastructure 
our gross margins may be adversely affected by increased price competition  component shortages  increases in material or labor costs  excess and obsolete inventory charges  changes in channels of distribution  or customer  product and geographic mix 
see also risk factors our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors

our income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced and stockholders equity increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan  or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  we receive an income tax benefit for the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the related deferred tax asset 
these benefits are credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accelerated vesting of stock options 
on november   our board of directors approved the immediate vesting of approximately million shares of unvested stock options previously awarded to employees and officers that have an exercise price of or greater under our equity compensation plans 
the closing market price per share of our common stock on november  was and the exercise prices of the approximately million in unvested options on that date ranged from to 
the board of directors made the decision to immediately vest these options based in part on the issuance of sfas r 
absent the acceleration of these options  upon adoption of sfas r  we would have been required to recognize approximately million in pre tax compensation expense from these options over their remaining vesting terms as of december  we also believe that because the options that were accelerated had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of our common stock  the options were not fully achieving their original objective of incentive compensation and employee retention 
certain of the stock options which were vested by the board of directors in november of were subsequently determined to require remeasurement as part of the restatement

indemnifications in the ordinary course of business  we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify the counter party from losses relating to a breach of representations and warranties  a failure to perform certain covenants  or claims and losses arising from certain external events as outlined within the particular contract  which may include  for example  losses arising from litigation or claims relating to past performance 
such indemnification clauses may not be subject to maximum loss clauses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates to our investment portfolio  which includes corporate and municipal bonds and government sponsored enterprise securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
we do not use interest rate swaps in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer or fund 
for liquidity purposes  our investment policy requires that we maintain a minimum of million in money market accounts of suitable credit quality 
our investment portfolio  excluding auction rate securities  is classified as held to maturity and is recorded at amortized cost  and includes only securities with original maturities of less than two years and with secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
since we hold our investments to maturity  we are exposed to risk in the event an issuer is not able to meet its obligations at maturity 
to mitigate this risk  our investment policy does not allow us to invest more than million with any one issuer 
we do not have any investments denominated in foreign country currencies  and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
we have performed a hypothetical sensitivity analysis assuming an immediate parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps for the entire year  while all other variables remain constant 
hypothetical bps  bps  and bps declines in interest rates as of december  would reduce our annualized interest income by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
foreign currency exchange rate risk currently  the majority of our international sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures 
for most currencies  we are a net payer of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a stronger us dollar and are adversely affected by a weaker us dollar relative to those foreign currencies 

table of contents we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december  and using a modeling technique that measures the change in fair values arising from a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at december  and the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material loss in the fair values of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at december  and
