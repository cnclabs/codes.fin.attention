the average duration of the company s pension plan obligations is calculated to be approximately thirteen years  representing the midpoint of which the sum of the present values of payments in the earlier years of the benefit payment stream equals the present value of payments in the later years 
the discount rate also considers the effect of the difference in duration by reference to the citigroup pension discount curve  as well as the effect of annualizing the moody s aa bond index rate at november  the asset return assumption takes into consideration historical and expected long term returns based upon the weighted allocation of equities  fixed income and other asset components comprising the pension plan s assets at november  the rate of compensation increase considers both historical and anticipated rates of future salary and other contingent compensation

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are contained in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management with due consideration given to materiality 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company has discussed its critical accounting policies with the audit and finance committee of the board of directors 
the following represents those critical accounting policies where materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
receivables  net of allowances at november   accounts receivable  net of allowances  were million 
net receivables were determined based upon the company s evaluation of known requirements  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
amounts associated with potential return of products as well as customer chargebacks  net of expected recoveries  are reflected in net accounts receivable 
these types of allowances are reflected as a reduction of sales upon the determination that such allowances can be reasonably estimated and are probable 
while the company believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  its customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to the company  could be adversely affected by declining sales of apparel at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
the potential additional allowance that would be required arising from the above described possible adverse economic conditions cannot be quantified with precision

and earnings before income taxes by approximately 
inventory valuation at november   inventories were million  and reflected the lifo valuation method for certain work in process and finished goods  as well as reductions from cost when required in order to state inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the lower of cost or market valuation considers the estimated realizable value in the current economic environment associated with disposing of surplus inventories 
additional downward valuation adjustments could be required should the current economic climate significantly worsen  resulting in retailers being unwilling to accept deliveries of advance orders placed or the company electing not to ship inventories to those retailers where additional credit risk is not deemed appropriate  or if a significant contraction were to occur in demand for the company s in stock replenishment business for selected product categories 
the potential additional downward valuation adjustments could result from unanticipated additional excess quantities of finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
the potential additional reserve that would be required arising from the above described possible adverse economic conditions cannot be quantified with precision 
if an additional allowance of of gross inventories was necessary  an additional provision of approximately million would result  which would reduce total assets at november  by approximately 
and earnings before income taxes by approximately

table of contents incurred in and 
at november   the company concluded that it is more likely than not that there would be sufficient taxable earnings to fully utilize the operating loss carryforwards and no tax valuation allowance was required 
a tax valuation reserve could be required in whole or in part in the future should the company s actual earnings or prospective earnings decrease the likelihood that sufficient taxable earnings will be generated to fully utilize the available carryforwards 
fully utilizing the million available operating loss carryforwards expiring by the end of fiscal will require average annual taxable earnings of approximately million over the period

the fair value allocated to the tradename  which was deemed to have an indefinite life and which is not being amortized  was million 
the tradename was valued using an income approach considering the relief from royalty and excess earnings methodologies 
the estimated remaining useful life was determined to be indefinite based on the current expectation to continue to use and promote the tradename indefinitely and the lack of any legal or economic constraint associated with the tradename 
similar methodologies were utilized to establish the fair value of intangibles associated with the acquisition of sweater 
com and simply blue which also included the assistance of an independent third party appraisal  which  among other things  established a fair value of million attributable to tradenames having an indefinite life for simply blue and million for sweater 
com 
should the operations of the businesses with which goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets are associated incur significant declines in profitability and cash flow in future years  some or all of the recorded goodwill or intangibles could be subject to impairment 
the value assigned to the misook  simply blue and sweater 
com tradenames could be subject to possible impairment to the extent that the brands were to experience significant future declines in demand resulting from such factors as consumer spending for apparel and retailers expectations of future apparel product sales 
revenue recognition sales are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues are net of anticipated returns  discounts and allowances 
as noted previously  amounts associated with the potential return of products and customer chargebacks net of expected recoveries are reflected as a reduction of sales and accounts receivable upon the determination that such allowances can be reasonably estimated and are probable 
shipping and handling revenues charged to customers are included in revenues while the related actual costs are reflected in cost of sales 
sales taxes  if any  are excluded from revenues 
stock based compensation 
stock compensation expense is calculated by estimating the fair value of each option using the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with sfas r 
the determination of fair value of stock option based payment awards is made as of their respective dates of grant using the option pricing model and is affected by the company s stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of other subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior  the expected risk free interest rate and dividend yield  if any 

table of contents the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because the company s employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of its outstanding employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer or willing seller market transaction 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the option after consideration of the estimated forfeiture rate 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is calculated by determining the fair value of each such award as of their respective dates of award using the average of the high and low price of the company s common stock on the new york stock exchange at such dates without any discount 
compensation expense for restricted stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the restricted stock award 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options grants and restricted stock awards would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
self insurance accruals the company retains certain of the financial risk for insuring workers compensation and certain non union employee group health claims 
operations are charged with the cost of claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
insurance accruals include estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates  some of which are actuarially determined  of incurred but not reported claims 
the determination of insurance claims and the appropriateness of the related liability accruals are reviewed and updated at regular intervals  based upon such factors as recent experience of ongoing claims  new claims initiated and claims settled during the period 
the amount of future payments to be made for workers compensation and employee group health claims cannot be quantified with precision 
if it were necessary to increase the respective accruals by resulting in an additional charge of approximately 
million  total liabilities would increase by approximately 
and earnings before income taxes would have been reduced by approximately

sfas is effective for all changes in an accounting principle made in fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to adopt sfas with its fiscal year beginning december  because sfas is directly dependent upon future events  the company cannot determine what effect  if any  the expected adoption of sfas will have on its financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both an income statement rollover and balance sheet iron curtain approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
if prior year errors that had been previously considered immaterial are now considered material based on either approach  no restatement is required as long as management properly applied its previous approach and all relevant facts and circumstances were considered 
if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening retained earnings as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
sab was effective for the company s fiscal year ending november  adoption of sab had no impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
outlook the company expects that it is well positioned for full year earnings growth compared to on lower sales  although first quarter operating results are anticipated to be impacted unfavorably by the residual impact of the implementation actions to further reduce the company s dependence on  and investment in tailored clothing sold to the mainstream department store channel 
the previously announced closing of the domestic tailored coat sewing facility was completed in december following the november closings of a fabric cutting shop and pant sewing facility 
also  the company did not renew two tailored clothing licenses which generated over million in fiscal sales  concluding that the required working capital investment can be better redeployed to higher operating margin opportunities directed towards the luxury and upper end price points sold in upscale retail stores 
as an example  the company acquired the zooey brand and business in december following its august acquisition of sweater 
com and its one girl who brand  while 
table of contents zooey revenues are very small currently  the company believes the brand has growth potential in its upscale retail specialty store customer base from both expanded product categories and additional retail doors 
also in december  the company entered into a long term licensing  marketing and services agreement with the largest manufacturer and retailer of men s suits in mainland china 
this agreement anticipates that the chinese licensee will eventually operate or franchise approximately hart schaffner marx retail locations in china  marketing men s apparel  accessories  footwear  eyewear  fragrances and watches under the hart schaffner marx brand  annual minimum royalties to the company are expected to increase from a nominal amount in the first few years to over million by year ten  aggregating approximately million over the year agreement term 
the company is cautious about retail business in the near term  in part from an expected shift of approximately million of advance order spring shipments from a large customer to the second quarter in fiscal from the first quarter in fiscal  however  full year operating margins are expected to improve from higher gross margins resulting from product mix changes and including the expected further reduction in moderate priced tailored clothing volume marketed principally to the mainstream department store channel 
lower interest expense and overall debt reduction are anticipated by year end  excluding the impact of future acquisitions or share repurchases  if any 
to date   shares have been repurchased  including  shares acquired thus far in fiscal the company s longer term objectives continue to be directed to increasing revenues and pre tax margin improvements from a combination of both internal revenue growth and from acquisitions 
the company continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities which can produce positive cash flows  accretive to earnings in the near to mid term and which do not create excessive debt leverage 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not hold financial instruments for trading purposes or engage in currency speculation 
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts from time to time to limit the currency risks  primarily associated with purchase obligations denominated in foreign currencies 
foreign exchange contracts are generally for amounts not to exceed forecasted purchase obligations or receipts and require the company to exchange us dollars for foreign currencies at rates agreed to at the inception of the contracts 
these contracts are typically settled by actual delivery of goods or receipt of funds 
the effects of movements in currency exchange rates on these instruments  which have not been significant  are recognized in earnings in the period in which the purchase obligations are satisfied or funds are received 
as of november   the company had not entered into foreign exchange contracts 
the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business  primarily as a result of the variable rate borrowings under its credit facility 
rates may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions  and the company could be subject to increased interest payments if market interest rates rise rapidly 
a change in the effective interest rate on the company s anticipated borrowings under its credit facility would impact annual interest expense by approximately 
million based on borrowings under the credit facility at november  in the last three years  the company has not used derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
the company s customers include major us retailers  certain of which are under common ownership and control 
the ten largest customers represented approximately of consolidated sales during fiscal with the two largest customers representing approximately and of sales  respectively 
recently  there have been several changes in ownership control regarding certain of the company s larger customers  including federated s acquisition of the may company stores and the sale of certain store groups formerly owned by saks  inc during  the company experienced declining sales largely in its moderate priced tailored clothing brands marketed to the mainstream department store channel and further decreases are anticipated during a decision by the controlling management of a group of stores or any significant customer  whether motivated by competitive conditions  financial difficulties or otherwise  to decrease the amount of merchandise purchased from the company  or change their manner of doing business  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial conditions and results of operations
