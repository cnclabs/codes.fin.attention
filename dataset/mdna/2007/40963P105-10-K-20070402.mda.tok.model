our research and development programs we have built a broad pipeline of oncology focused drug candidates  which include therapeutic product candidates designed to destroy cancer cells  and supportive care product candidates designed to treat or prevent side effects caused by therapeutic cancer treatments 
we are currently developing six product candidates  four of which are therapeutics and two of which are supportive care product candidates 
cancer therapeutics marqibo vincristine sulfate liposomes injection  or marqibo  a novel  targeted sphingosomal formulation product candidate of the fda approved anticancer drug vincristine  being developed for the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphoma  or nhl  and acute lymphoblastic leukemia  or all  talvesta talotrexin for injection  being evaluated as a novel antifolate drug product candidate to be used as a chemotherapy agent in the treatment of various unresectable  advanced solid tumors and hematological malignancies  including non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc  all and other solid tumors  alocrest vinorelbine tartrate liposomes injection  a novel targeted sphingosomal encapsulated formulation product candidate of the fda approved anticancer drug vinorelbine  being developed for the treatment of solid tumors including nsclc and breast cancer  and sphingosome encapsulated topotecan  a novel targeted sphingosomal encapsulated formulation product candidate comprised of the anticancer drug topotecan  which is fda approved for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of initial or subsequent chemotherapy  and small cell lung cancer sensitive disease after failure of first line chemotherapy 
supportive care zensana ondansetron hci oral spray  or zensana  being developed to alleviate chemotherapy and radiation induced and post operative nausea and vomiting  and menadione  a novel preclinical product candidate for the prevention and treatment of skin rash associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  inhibitors in the treatment of certain cancers 
historical development  merger transaction we were originally incorporated under delaware law in december under the name hudson health sciences  inc in july  we acquired publicly held email real estate 
com  inc  or emlr  in a reverse merger 
in connection with the transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of emlr merged into our company  with hana remaining as a wholly owned subsidiary of emlr 
in connection with the merger  emlr issued to our stockholders approximately percent of the outstanding equity of emlr on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to the transaction 
in september  emlr was reincorporated under delaware law by merging with and into hana  then its wholly owned subsidiary  with hana remaining as the surviving corporation 
in connection with the reincorporation  each outstanding common share became automatically exchangeable into one twelfth of a common share of the reincorporated company 
industry background and market opportunity cancer is a group of diseases characterized by either the uncontrolled growth of cells or the failure of cells to die normally 
cancer is caused by a series of mutations  or alterations  in genes that control cells ability to grow and divide 
these mutations cause cells to rapidly and continuously divide or lose their normal ability to die 
there are more than different varieties of cancer  which can be divided into six major categories 
carcinomas  the most common category  include breast  lung  colorectal and prostate cancer 
sarcomas begin in tissue that connects  supports or surrounds other tissues and organs 
lymphomas are cancers of the lymphatic system  a part of the body s immune system 
leukemias are cancers of blood cells  which originate in the bone marrow 
brain tumors are cancers that begin in the brain  and skin cancers  including melanomas  originate in the skin 
cancers are considered metastatic if they spread via the blood or lymphatic system to other parts of the body to form secondary tumors 
according to the american cancer society  nearly million new cases of cancer are expected to be diagnosed in in the united states alone 
cancer is the second leading cause of death  after heart disease  in the united states  and is expected to account for more than  deaths in major cancer treatments include surgery  radiotherapy and chemotherapy 
supportive care  such as anti nausea drugs  represents another major segment of the cancer treatment market 
there are many different drugs that are used to treat cancer  including cytotoxics or antineoplastics  hormones and biologics 
major categories include chemotherapy 
cytotoxic chemotherapy refers to anticancer drugs that destroy cancer cells by stopping them from multiplying 
healthy cells can also be harmed with the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy  especially those that divide quickly 
cytotoxic agents act primarily on macromolecular synthesis  repair or activity  which affects the production or function of dna  rna or proteins 
our product candidates marqibo and talvesta are both cytotoxic agents we plan to evaluate for the treatment of solid and hematological tumors 
supportive care 
cancer treatment can include the use of chemotherapy  radiation therapy  biologic response modifiers  surgery or some combination of these or other therapeutic options 
all of these treatment options are directed at killing or eradicating the cancer that exists in the patient s body 
unfortunately  the delivery of many cancer therapies adversely affects the body s normal organs 
these complications of treatment or side effects not only cause discomfort  but may also prevent the optimal delivery of therapy to a patient at its optimal dose and time 
for example  the most common side effects of chemotherapy are nausea and vomiting  which are generally treated by antiemetic drugs such as ondansetron 
our product candidate zensana is an oral mist spray formulation of ondansetron 
additionally  menadione is our supportive care product candidate designed to treat and prevent skin rash associated with the use of egfr inhibitors  a type of anti cancer agent 
are both supportive care product candidates that we plan to continue developing 
our strategy we are committed to creating value by building a strong  experienced team  accelerating the development of our lead product candidates  expanding our pipeline by being the alliance partner of choice for academic and research organizations  and nurturing a unique company culture 
key aspects of our strategy include focus on developing innovative cancer therapies 
we focus on oncology product candidates in order to capture efficiencies and economies of scale 
we believe that drug development for cancer markets is particularly attractive because relatively small clinical trials can provide meaningful information regarding patient response and safety 
the oncology market is concentrated  meaning that a small number of doctors write a large percentage of prescriptions  and we believe that the market can be addressed by a relatively small  focused salesforce 
furthermore  we believe that our capabilities are well suited to the oncology market and represent distinct competitive advantages 
build a sustainable pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and disciplined decision criteria based on clearly defined proof of principle goals 
we seek to build a sustainable product pipeline by employing multiple therapeutic approaches and by acquiring product candidates belonging to known drug classes 
in addition  we employ disciplined decision criteria to assess product candidates 
by pursuing this strategy  we seek to minimize our clinical development risk and accelerate the potential commercialization of current and future product candidates 
for a majority of our product candidates  we intend to pursue regulatory approval in multiple indications 
our cancer therapeutic product pipeline background of sphingosomal targeted drug delivery sphingosomal encapsulation is a novel method of liposomal drug delivery  which is designed to significantly increase tumor targeting and duration of exposure for cell cycle specific anticancer agents 
sphingosomal drug delivery consists of using a generic fda approved cancer agent  such as vincristine  encapsulated in a lipid envelope 
the encapsulated agent is carried through the bloodstream and delivered to disease sites where it is released to carry out its therapeutic action 
when used in unencapsulated form  chemotherapeutic drugs diffuse indiscriminately throughout the body  diluting drug effectiveness and causing toxic side effects in the patient s healthy tissues 
our proprietary sphingosomal formulation technology is designed to permit loading higher concentrations of therapeutic agent inside the lipid envelope  which promotes accumulation of the drug in tumors and prolongs the drug s release at disease sites 
clinical trials have demonstrated the sphingosomal formulation technology s ability to deliver dose intensification to the tumor  which we believe has the potential to increase the therapeutic benefit of the drug 
longer circulation time in the bloodstream is designed to deliver more of the therapeutic agent to targeted tumor sites over a longer period of time 
to stabilize the lipid bilayer walls and retain active drug within its interior  liposomal technology uses sphingomyelin  a biologically inert macromolecule that renders liposomes resistant to hydrolysis and enzymatic degradation 
the increased rigidity of the liposomal walls prolongs the circulating life of liposomes and is designed to extend the duration of drug release 
sphingosomal drugs like marqibo accumulate in the pores of leaky tumor vessels created during angiogenesis 
in normal tissues  a continuous endothelial lining constrains liposomes within capillaries  preventing accumulation of the drug in the healthy tissues 
in contrast  the immature blood vessel system within tumors is created during tumor growth and has numerous holes up to nanometers in size 
with an average diameter of approximately nanometers  liposomes accumulate in these pores 
once lodged within the interstitial space  these liposomes slowly release the encapsulated drug 
we believe that slow release of the drug from liposomes increases drug levels within the tumor  extends drug exposure through multiple cell cycles  and significantly increases tumor cell killing 
fewer than of a patient s tumor cells are in a drug sensitive phase at any point in time  which we believe indicates that duration of drug exposure is critical to increased drug efficacy 
increased drug concentration at the tumor site is associated with increased efficacy 
the link between drug exposure and anti tumor efficacy is especially pronounced for cell cycle specific agents such as vincristine  vinorelbine and topotecan  which destroy tumor cells by interfering in one specific phase the g m phase in cell division 
marqibo vincristine sulfate liposomes injection unmet medical needs in all and nhl all is a type of cancer of the blood and bone marrow  the spongy tissue inside bones where blood cells are made 
acute leukemias progress rapidly and affect immature blood cells 
all affects a group of white blood cells  called lymphocytes  which fight infection 
normally  bone marrow produces immature cells or stem cells  in a controlled way  and they mature and specialize into the various types of blood cells  as needed 
in people with all  this production process breaks down 
large numbers of immature  abnormal lymphocytes called lymphoblasts are produced and released into the bloodstream 
these abnormal cells are not able to mature and perform their usual functions 
furthermore  they multiply rapidly and can crowd out healthy blood cells  leaving an adult or child with all vulnerable to infection or bleeding 
leukemic cells can also collect in certain areas of the body  including the central nervous system and spinal cord  which can cause serious problems 
according to the american cancer society  almost  people in the united states are expected to be diagnosed with all in multiple clinical trials have suggested the overall survival rate for adults diagnosed with all is approximately to  underscoring the need for new therapeutic options 
nhl is a heterogeneous disease which is estimated to result in more than  new cases and nearly  deaths in in the united states  according to the american cancer society 
nhl can be divided into two prognostic groups indolent lymphomas and aggressive lymphomas 
patients with indolent nhl types have a relatively good prognosis  with median survival as long as years after diagnosis  but they usually are not curable in advanced clinical stages 
the aggressive type of nhl is more rapidly progressive  but a significant number of these patients can be cured with intensive combination chemotherapy regimens which include agents such as vincristine 
multiple clinical trials have suggested that  with current treatment  overall five year survival of nhl patients is approximately to 
of patients with aggressive nhl  to can achieve durable remission 
the vast majority of relapses occur in the first two years after therapy and new therapeutic options within this time frame are needed 
product description marqibo is a novel  targeted sphingosomal formulation product candidate comprised of the fda approved anticancer drug vincristine 
this encapsulation is designed to provide prolonged circulation of the drug in the blood and accumulation at the tumor site 
these characteristics are intended to increase the effectiveness and reduce the side effects of the encapsulated drug 
vincristine  a microtubule inhibitor  is fda approved for all and is widely used as a single agent and in combination regimens for treatment for hematologic malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias 
clinical development program we acquired our rights to marqibo from inex pharmaceuticals corporation in may marqibo has been evaluated in clinical trials with over patients  including phase ii clinical trials in patients with nhl and all 
based on the results from these studies  we plan to conduct a phase ii  open label trial in relapsed adult all 
we also plan to conduct a phase iii front line clinical trial in adults with all as a primary registrational trial 
this phase iii randomized  multicenter trial will compare marqibo to vincristine in the induction  consolidation  and maintenance phases of treatment in elderly patients with all 
we plan to conduct this study in collaboration with three major oncology cooperative groups eastern cooperative oncology group  southwest oncology group  and cancer and leukemia group b 
pending finalization of the protocol by the cooperative groups  we plan to initiate this study in the objectives of the phase iii clinical trial will be rates of complete remission  or cr  and complete remission without full platelet recovery  or crp  in the induction  consolidation  and maintenance phases of chemotherapy  cr and crp duration  overall survival  induction mortality  and safety and tolerability of the drug 
cr is defined as a reduction in detectable disease and or blast counts of less than 
in addition  we anticipate pursuing a randomized pivotal trial in front line nhl  where marqibo has previously demonstrated positive indications of clinical benefit 
inex previously sponsored multiple marqibo clinical trials  two of which provide the basis for our clinical development plan 
the first is an ongoing phase i ii clinical trial using milligrams per meter squared combined with a fixed dose of oral dexamethasone in all 
as of december   patients have been treated on the phase i portion of this clinical trial with dosing ranging from to milligrams per meter squared weekly 
twenty four percent of the patients achieved cr and on an intent to treat basis  and the toxicity profile was consistent with vincristine at the normal dose 
an additional phase ii clinical trial was completed by the university of texas md anderson cancer center  or md anderson  in january this trial employed the use of r chop  a common treatment regimen for nhl consisting of rituximab  cyclophosphamide  doxorubicim  vincristine and prednisone 
this clinical trial involved patients with previously untreated aggressive nhl in which marqibo was substituted for free vincristine 
of the patients treated  of patients achieved a cr 
these results compare favorably with the to cr rates historically achieved in patients receiving r chop 
marqibo received orphan drug designation in january for the treatment of adult all 
alocrest vinorelbine tartrate liposomes injection alocrest is a novel sphingosomal encapsulated formulation product candidate of the fda approved drug vinorelbine  a microtubule inhibitor for use as a single agent or in combination with cisplatin for the first line treatment of unresectable  advanced non small cell lung cancer 
in august  we initiated a phase i study of alocrest in the treatment of advanced solid tumors  nhl or hodgkin s disease 
the objectives of the phase i clinical trial are to assess the safety and tolerability of treatment with alocrest  to determine the maximum tolerated dose of alocrest  to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of alocrest  and to explore preliminary efficacy of alocrest 
the open label  single arm  non randomized  multi center  dose escalation study is currently being conducted at the cancer therapy and research center in san antonio  texas and at mcgill university in montreal 
approximately patients with histologically confirmed solid tumors  non hodgkin s lymphoma or hodgkin s disease refractory to standard therapy will be enrolled 
as of december  seven patients received at least one dose of alocrest 
sphingosome encapsulated topotecan sphingosome encapsulated topotecan is our proprietary product candidate comprised of the anticancer drug topotecan encapsulated in sphingosomes 
topotecan is fda approved for the treatment of metastatic carcinoma of the ovary after failure of initial or subsequent chemotherapy  and small cell lung cancer sensitive disease after failure of first line chemotherapy 
following completion of additional preclinical development  we expect to file an ind and initiate clinical trials in talvesta talotrexin for injection product candidate background and preclinical data antifolates  also known as folic acid analogs  are a class of cytotoxic or antineoplastic agents  which are structural analogs of naturally occurring compounds that interfere with the production of nucleic acids known as antimetabolites 
antifolates have been used clinically for more than years to treat both solid and hematological cancers such as breast cancer and all  as well as inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis 
antimetabolites are the most widely used antifolates 
one such antimetabolite  methotrexate  is structurally related to folic acid and acts as an antagonist to this vitamin by inhibiting dhfr  the enzyme that converts folic acid to its active form 
rapidly dividing cells  such as cancer cells  need folic acid to multiply 
the decreased level of folic acid leads to depressed dna  rna  and protein synthesis which in turn lead to cell death 
talvesta is a novel antifolate that is a water soluble  non polyglutamatable analogue of aminopterin 
talvesta was developed at the dana farber cancer institute  inc and the national cancer institute  or nci  as part of a program to develop oncology product candidates with improved efficacy  tolerability and resistance 
we believe that potential advantages of talvesta over existing therapies include increased targeting of tumor cells talvesta produces cytotoxicity by inhibiting dhfr 
it binds to dhfr more tightly than other antifolates  allowing talvesta to inhibit dna synthesis more potently than other antifolates  including methotrexate 
in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies at the dana farber cancer institute  inc and the nci  talvesta demonstrated that it is fold more tightly bound to dhfr  than methotrexate  has fold higher affinity to the membrane bound transporter utilized by methotrexate  and demonstrated to fold more potency than methotrexate 
we believe that these characteristics may allow for potent  targeted delivery of talvesta 
better tolerability we believe that talvesta may be more tolerable than other existing anticancer drugs 
classical compounds such as methotrexate are polyglutamated once they enter the cells 
polyglutamation is an enzymatic process which allows the drug to stay in the cell and act on its target more effectively 
however  while healthy cells maintain their ability to make polyglutamates  cancer cells lose their ability to form polyglutamates 
consequently  the drug stays in the healthy cells  causing toxicity and preventing the drug from exerting its effect on the cancer cell to destroy it 
talvesta blocks and alters the side chain of the compound  which allows the drug to stay in the cancer cell and act on its target 
superior resistance profile in preclinical studies  talvesta has demonstrated activity against tumor cells that were resistant to other antifolates 
human head and neck squamous carcinoma cells that were resistant to methotrexate were shown to be highly sensitive to the effects of talvesta 
distinct dose dependent activity in preclinical studies  talvesta showed significant dose responsiveness which may suggest a wide therapeutic index the difference between the minimum effective dose and maximum tolerated dose of a drug  as well as enhanced clinical utility 
clinical development program in april  nci initiated a phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety of talvesta when administering it intravenously on days  and of a day cycle to patients with solid tumors 
the patients selected for the clinical trial had failed curative or survival prolonging therapy  or no such therapies existed for them 
in march  this clinical trial  which was being conducted at the dana farber cancer institute  inc  massachusetts general hospital and beth israel deaconess hospital  was discontinued due to toxicity 
fifty subjects received doses of talvesta with one patient death being reported during this clinical trial 
in february  we commenced an open label multicenter  multinational phase i ii clinical trial of talvesta in the treatment of relapsed or refractory nsclc 
in the phase i portion of this trial  increasing doses of talvesta were administered as a five minute intravenous infusion on days and on a day cycle to eligible patients 
talvesta was well tolerated over multiple cycles of therapy with myelosuppression and mucositis as the dose limiting toxicities 
four patient deaths were reported in the phase i portion of this clinical trial 
the phase i portion of this clinical trial is now closed for enrollment with patients receiving at least one dose of talvesta 
the declared maximum tolerated dose was milligrams per metered squared for a total dose per cycle of milligrams per metered squared 
two partial responses and eight stable diseases for greater than or equal to cycles of therapy were reported  with an overall response rate of 
the primary objective of the phase ii portion of this ongoing clinical trial are to demonstrate an improvement in overall patient survival 
secondary objectives include evaluation of safety  overall response rate  time to progression and progression free survival 
relapsed or refractory nsclc patients who failed at least two lines of treatment including standard chemotherapy and or epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor are eligible to enroll in phase ii of this clinical trial 
while the phase ii portion had enrolled patients through december  we have stopped enrollment and intend to launch a replacement trial  evaluating talvesta on day of a day cycle  in order to optimize the therapeutic index based on emerging pharmacokinetics and clinical evidence 
in may  we commenced an open label  multicenter phase i ii clinical trial of talvesta in the treatment of refractory all 
the primary objectives of the phase i portion of this clinical trial were to evaluate the safety of talvesta when administered as a five minute intravenous infusion on days through on a day cycle to refractory all patients who failed curative or survival prolonging therapy or for whom no such therapies exist and to establish the maximum tolerated dose and identify the dose limiting toxicities of talvesta 
the phase i portion of this clinical trial is now closed for enrollment  with patients receiving at least one dose of talvesta 
the declared maximum tolerated dose was milligram per metered squared for a total dose per cycle of milligrams per metered squared 
mucositis was reported at the dose limiting toxicity 
the primary objective of the phase ii portion of this clinical trial is to evaluate the anti tumor activity of talvesta as therapy in all patients with relapsed or refractory to frontline and or salvage therapy as measured by overall response 
the secondary objective is to assess the impact of talvesta as measured by duration of remission and survival 
based on the toxicities observed in the phase solid tumor trial  we have decided to conduct additional toxicology studies 
while we have not seen issues related to toxicity in the all trial  we have suspended enrollment in the phase ii portion as a safety precaution 
we intend to reopen the phase ii portion of this clinical trial and to initiate new clinical trials with talvesta when these additional toxicology studies have been completed and analyzed 
at this time  we anticipate the toxicology studies to be completed in the fourth quarter of talvesta received orphan drug designation in may for the treatment of all 
our supportive care product pipeline zensana ondansetron hci oral spray background the management of nausea and vomiting induced by chemo and radiation therapy and or following surgery is a critical aspect of cancer patient care 
the nci estimates that a majority of the approximately  patients receiving chemotherapy treatment per year experience nausea and vomiting  and could benefit from nausea reducing  or antiemetic  therapies 
ondansetron is a selective blocking agent of the serotonin ht receptor type and is widely accepted as the standard of care for antiemesis 
ondansetron is currently fda approved for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with moderate to highly emetogenic cancer chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  or cinv  radiotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  or rinv  in patients receiving total body irradiation  single high dose fraction to the abdomen  or daily fractions to the abdomen  and post operative induced nausea and vomiting  or ponv 
our product candidate zensana utilizes a novel micro mist spray technology to deliver full doses of ondansetron to patients receiving emetogenic  or vomiting and or nausea inducing  chemotherapy 
we believe the convenience of spray delivery will offer patients a desirable alternative to tablets and other currently available forms of ondansetron 
clinical development program we completed our bioequivalence and bioavailability trials for zensana in june our clinical development program consisted of four clinical trials including single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic studies  and an evaluation of the effects of food and water on zensana 
while not yet approved by the fda  we believe data from the four studies demonstrated that the standard milligram dose of zensana is statistically bioequivalent to the current commercially available milligram ondansetron zofran tablet 
zensana showed statistically faster absorption  as defined by median time to detectible drug levels of ondansetron  of minutes for zensana compared to minutes for the tablet 
in the four studies  zensana was well tolerated by both men and women and had a side effect profile similar to ondansetron tablets  which included mild headache and constipation 
in june  we submitted our nda for zensana for the prevention of cinv  rinv and ponv under section b of the fdca  a form of registration that relies  at least in part  on data in previously approved ndas or published literature for which we do not have a right of reference or both 
while our nda was pending with the fda  long term stability studies revealed small amounts of precipitated material in scale up batches of zensana 
through further investigation of this issue  we have determined that the precipitation issue in long term stability was not related to the manufacturing process  but was instead an issue with the original formulation 
as a result  in march  we withdrew our nda previously submitted to the fda 
we have stopped further investigation of the original formulation 
our partner and licensor  novadel  has developed an alternate formulation of the product 
the alternate formulation is currently under active investigation and scale up 
if this alternative formulation is stable  we will then need to reestablish bioequivalency through new clinical trials 
if these studies are successful  we anticipate being in a position to file an nda sometime in  at the earliest 
menadione menadione  which we licensed from the albert einstein college of medicine in october  is a novel preclinical product candidate under development for the prevention and treatment of skin rash associated with the use of epidermal growth factor receptor  or egfr  inhibitors in the treatment of certain cancers 
egfr inhibitors are currently used to treat nsclc  pancreatic  colorectal  and head and neck cancer 
egfr inhibitors develop significant skin toxicities presenting as acne like rash on the face and upper body 
menadione  a small organic molecule  has been shown to activate the egfr signaling pathway by inhibiting phosphatase activity 
in vivo studies have suggested that topically applied menadione may restore egfr signaling specifically in the skin of patients treated systemically with egfr inhibitors 
currently  there are no fda approved products or therapies available to treat these skin toxicities 
we expect to complete formulation of menadione and to file an ind by the end of license agreements marqibo  alocrest and sphingosome encapsulated topotecan in may  we completed a transaction with inex pharmaceuticals corporation pursuant to which we acquired exclusive  worldwide rights to develop and commercialize three product candidates marqibo  sphingosome encapsulated vinorelbine and sphingosome encapsulated topotecan  collectively called the licensed products 
in consideration for the rights and assets acquired from inex  the company was to pay to inex aggregate consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and  shares of its common stock

zensana pursuant to the terms of an october license agreement with novadel pharma  inc  as amended in august  may and december  we hold a royalty bearing  exclusive right and license with the right to sublicense with novadel s prior written consent to develop and commercialize novadel s oral spray version of ondansetron in the united states and canada  while novadel retained the rights to the development and commercialization of zensana in other countries and all non human uses of zensana 
in addition  novadel also retained the rights to conduct internal  non commercial research and development activities with respect to zensana in all countries  and the rights to use the oral spray technology with other drug products  either by itself or with a third party 
under the agreement  we and novadel collaborated on the initial development governed by a development plan and overseen by a joint development committee on the formulation  analytical method and manufacturing process development for zensana 
the joint development committee continues to discuss potential strategies for zensana going forward  including regulatory strategies for zensana 
under the license agreement  we are responsible for the regulatory filings for zensana and associated costs and all such filings will be made in our name and have us as the primary contact 
we consult with novadel on such filings and keep novadel informed as to our communications with the regulatory authorities  although we have the right to determine the regulatory pathways we feel best meet our objectives 
novadel does have the non exclusive right to use and reference all our regulatory filings and data contained therein for all purposes 
we will be responsible for the clinical and commercial supply of zensana 
we may engage a third party for the manufacture of zensana  provided that novadel will have the right to review all agreements with such third party manufacturer and to purchase zensana from such third party at essentially the same costs as we do  and provided that such third party agreements contain sufficient confidentiality and non use obligations 
subsequently  we have agreed that rechon life sciences  ltd formerly ferring ab  will take over novadel s supply obligations to us 
rechon supplied our clinical supply under a purchase order which was reviewed by novadel 
the confidentiality and non use obligations of rechon are governed under a separate confidentiality agreement between us and rechon entered into in june we plan to enter into a manufacturing agreement with them for the commercial supply of zensana 
to date  rechon has also supplied us with the spray pump components and oral applicator for zensana  and we anticipate that the manufacturing agreement that we intend to enter into for zensana will also include all components of the delivery device 
in consideration for the license  the agreement provides that we will make double digit royalty payments to novadel based on a percentage of net sales as defined in the agreement 
in addition  we issued novadel  shares of our common stock determined by dividing  by the average selling price of our common stock during the business days preceding the date of the license agreement and we purchased  shares of novadel s common stock at a price of per share 
pursuant to the license agreement  we are also obligated to pay novadel up to an additional million upon achievement of certain milestones 
novadel will own all information and inventions that are made by or on behalf of us  our affiliates and sublicensees relating to the oral spray process or the zensana product  and all licensed trademarks 
novadel has the right to file  prosecute and maintain all licensed patent applications  patents and trademarks  and we have the right to comment on the filings  but novadel will not be obligated to incorporate our comments 
if novadel decides to discontinue the filing  prosecution or maintenance of any such patent or patent application in a particular country  then we have the right to do so 
novadel also has the first right to enforce the licensed patents and we need to reimburse novadel for of its out of pocket costs with respect to the removal of any such infringement to the extent such infringement adversely affects the exploitation of zensana in the united states and canada  and we have the right to enforce such patents only if novadel fails to do so 
novadel is also in control of any defense of third party infringement  invalidity or unenforceability suit  and we are required to reimburse novadel for of the costs and expenses associated with such suit to the extent it relates to the exploitation of zensana 
we do not have a clear contractual right to defend against such third party lawsuits even if novadel fails to do so 
we have also covenanted not to institute or prosecute any action seeking to have any claim in the licensed patents declared invalid or unenforceable 
novadel may terminate our license  after giving us notice and an opportunity to cure  for our material breach day cure period or payment default day cure period 
the license also terminates automatically if we are involved in a bankruptcy 
in the event this license agreement is terminated  we will lose all of our rights to develop and commercialize zensana 
the license agreement expires on the later of the expiration date of the last to expire patent covered by the license  currently march  or october  years from the effective date of the license agreement 
we have the right to terminate this agreement by giving novadel a day notice or by not making a milestone payment when due 
we are required to indemnify novadel for losses arising from the breach of this agreement by us  our affiliates or sublicensees or permitted assigns or transferees  the actual or asserted violations of law by us  our affiliates or sublicensees or permitted assigns or transferees  the use by us  our affiliates or sublicensees or permitted assigns or transferees of the oral spray technology with ondansetron  or the exploitation of zensana by us  our affiliates  sublicensees or permitted assigns or transferees  to the extent novadel is not required to indemnify us for such losses 
novadel agreed to indemnify us for losses arising from the breach of this agreement by novadel or its affiliates or the actual or asserted violation of law by novadel or its affiliates  to the extent we are not required to indemnify novadel for such losses 
in either case  the indemnifying party will have control over the defense and settlement of any claim or action relating to such losses and the indemnified party will have the right to participate 
the indemnifying party has the right to consent to monetary damages but will need the indemnified party s consent before consenting to any damages that will result in the indemnified party s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the indemnified party in any manner 
menadione our rights to menadione are governed by the terms of an october license agreement with the albert einstein college of medicine of yeshiva university  a division of yeshiva university  or aecom 
the agreement provides us with an exclusive worldwide royalty bearing license  including the right to grant sublicenses 
in consideration for the license  we agreed to issue to aecom a number of shares of our common stock shares having an aggregate value of  valued at a per share price of  the closing price of our common stock on october  in addition  we also agreed to make a cash payment and to pay annual maintenance fees 
further  hana agreed to make milestone payments in the aggregate amount of  upon the achievement of various clinical and regulatory milestones  as described in the agreement 
one half of each milestone payment may be satisfied by issuing shares of our common stock valued as of the date such payment becomes payable  however  the agreement expressly provides that the maximum number of shares of our common stock what may be issued under the agreement in satisfaction of the our obligations may not exceed of the total number of shares outstanding on the date of the agreement 
we also agreed to make royalty payments to the aecom on net sales of any products covered by a claim in any licensed patent 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for prosecuting and maintaining the licensed patents  including resisting challenges to the validity of such patents  at our own cost 
the agreement also provides that aecom shall promptly disclose to us any potential future inventions as that term is defined in the agreement  and thereafter  we may proceed to file any appropriate patent applications relating to such future invention at its own expense 
such patent application s will be thereafter covered by the license granted to us under the agreement 
we have the right under the agreement to initiate  in our sole discretion and at our expense  legal proceedings on our or aecom s behalf against any infringers or potential infringers of the licensed patents 
we and aecom agreed to share any proceeds received from such proceedings  with hana receiving a majority of such proceeds 
if we decline to initiate such proceedings against an infringer  aecom may do so and will then be entitled to keep a majority of any proceeds recovered 
the agreement will expire upon the expiration of the last patent subject to the agreement  which would be in if the patent applications subject to the agreement are issued 
we may terminate the agreement at any time by giving days notice to aecom 
either party may also terminate the agreement in the event the other defaults or breaches any condition of the agreement  which default or breach is not remedied within days of the date the non breaching party provides written notice to the other party of such default or breach 
however  if we are in breach of a payment obligation under the agreement  aecom may terminate the agreement following a period of days in which we fail to remedy such breach 
if aecom terminates the agreement under such provision  our rights under the licensed patents terminate 
the agreement and the licenses may also be terminated by aecom in the event we make an assignment for the benefit of creditors  we initiate a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding or if we are declared bankrupt or insolvent 
aecom may also terminate the agreement in the event we are convicted of a felony relating to the manufacture  sale or use of a licensed product or a felony involving moral turpitude 
no termination of the agreement  however  will be construed as a termination of any valid sublicense made by us 
in addition to the license  the agreement also provides that aecom will conduct certain research relating to the licensed technology 
the research project will be at our expense  pursuant to an agreed upon budget  and conducted over a two year period 
to the extent such research results in any invention or discovery  whether or not patentable  but excluding a future invention which would become subject to the license under the agreement  we will have a month exclusive period in which to negotiate a license from aecom relating to such invention or discovery 
intellectual property general patents and other proprietary rights are very important to the development of our business 
we will be able to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
it is our intention to seek and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our product candidates and our proprietary technologies 
as part of our business strategy  our policy is to actively file patent applications in the united states and internationally to cover methods of use  new chemical compounds  pharmaceutical compositions and dosing of the compounds and compositions and improvements in each of these 
we also rely on trade secret information  technical know how  innovation and agreements with third parties to continuously expand and protect our competitive position 
we own  or license the rights to  a number of patents and patent applications related to our product candidates  but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that the pending patent applications will issue as patents 
the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
therefore  we cannot predict with certainty the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents  or their enforceability 
to date  there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications  if issued 
if our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology also claimed by us  we may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention  which could result in substantial cost  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that before we commercialize any of our product candidates  any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization  thus reducing any advantage of the patent 
if patents are issued to others containing preclusive or conflicting claims and these claims are ultimately determined to be valid  we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products may seriously harm our business 
we also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
litigation would create substantial costs 
an adverse outcome in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology if such licenses are unavailable 
zensana our license with novadel pharma  inc relating to zensana covers two issued us patents covering compositions of matter and methods of use  both of which expire in  and six related pending us patent applications 
if issued  all of the pending patent applications would expire in and cover methods of use  and three applications would additionally cover compositions of matter 
the current clinical candidate formulation is covered by one issued us patent covering compositions of matter  and if issued  four pending applications covering methods of use  two of which also cover compositions of matter 
we are aware of certain united states patents that relate to ondansetron compositions and uses therefor to treat nausea and vomiting 
these patents pertain to zofran  an fda approved first generation ht antagonist product upon which we intend to file our nda application for zensana under section b of the fdca 
certain of these patents are due to expire in advance of our planned commercial launch of zensana in the united states in the first half of upon commercialization  if zensana or its commercial use or production meets all of the requirements of any of the claims of the aforementioned patents or any other patents  or patents that may issue from related patent applications or any other patent applications  then we may need a license to one or more of these patents 
if any licenses are required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms  if at all  and if these licenses are not obtained  we might be prevented from commercializing zensana 
sphingosomal product candidates pursuant to our license agreement with inex and related sublicense with ubc  we have exclusive rights to issued us patents and allowed us patent application  issued foreign patents  pending us patent applications and pending foreign applications  covering composition of matter  method of use and treatment  formulation and process 
these patents and patent applications cover sphingosome based pharmaceutical compositions including marqibo  alocrest and sphingosomal topotecan  formulation  dosage  process of making the liposome compositions  and methods of use of the compositions in the treatment cancer  relapsed cancer  and solid tumors 
the earliest of these issued patents expires in and the last of the issued patents expires in if the allowed us patent application issues  it will expire in talvesta under our license agreement with the dana farber cancer institute  inc and ash stevens  inc  we have exclusive  worldwide rights to two issued us patents and two pending us patent applications that relate to talvesta and particular uses of talvesta according to the company s business plan 
both issued patents include composition of matter claims and one of them also includes claims to methods of using talvesta to treat leukemia or cancers involving lymphoblasts 
the earlier of the issued patents is currently scheduled to expire in january the later of the two issued patents is currently scheduled to expire in if either or both of the pending patent applications issues  the issued patent or patents would be scheduled to expire in in addition  in  we filed two us provisional patent applications directed primarily to particular methods of using talvesta 
if any us patent claiming priority to one or both of these provisional patent applications issues  such a patent would be scheduled to expire in a pct application claiming priority to these two provisional patent applications is currently pending 
moreover  a us patent application directed to methods of treating inflammatory diseases is currently pending 
should this application issue to a us patent  the patent would be scheduled to expire in menadione we have exclusive  worldwide rights to a pct application pursuant to our october license agreement with aecom 
this application covers both compositions of matter eg  pharmaceutical compositions and methods of use eg  methods of treating and preventing a skin rash secondary to an anti epidermal growth factor receptor therapy 
if any us or foreign patent claiming priority to the pct application issues  then such a patent would be scheduled to expire in other intellectual property rights we also depend upon trademarks  trade secrets  know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we require our employees  scientific advisors  consultants and collaborators  upon commencement of a relationship with us  to execute confidentiality agreements and  in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators  to agree to assign their inventions to us 
these agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us 
these agreements may not  however  provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information 
in addition to patent protection  we may utilize orphan drug regulations to provide market exclusivity for certain of our product candidates 
the orphan drug regulations of the fda provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases  currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than  individuals in the united states  or  diseases that affect more than  individuals in the united states but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for such fda approved orphan product 
we believe that certain of the indications for our product candidates will be eligible for orphan drug designation  however  we cannot assure you that our drugs will obtain such orphan drug designation or will be the first to reach the market and provide us with such market exclusivity protection 
government regulation and product approval the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the testing preclinical and clinical  manufacturing  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  advertising  promotion  import  export  marketing and distribution  among other things  of drugs and drug product candidates 
if we do not comply with applicable requirements  we may be fined  the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications or allow us to manufacture or market our products  and we may be criminally prosecuted 
we and our manufacturers may also be subject to regulations under other united states federal  state  and local laws 
united states government regulation in the united states  the fda regulates drugs under the fdca and implementing regulations 
the process required by the fda before our product candidates may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following although the fda is given wide discretion to impose different or more stringent requirements on a case by case basis completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical animal studies and formulation studies  all performed in accordance with the fda s good laboratory practice regulations and other regulations  submission to the fda of an ind application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of multiple adequate and well controlled clinical trials meeting fda requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication  submission of an nda to the fda  satisfactory completion of an fda pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product candidate is produced  and potentially other involved facilities as well  to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp  regulations and other applicable regulations  and the fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our product candidates will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
risks to us related to these regulations are described under item a of this annual report under the subheading risks related to the clinical testing  regulatory approval and manufacturing of our product candidates 
preclinical tests may include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as studies to evaluate toxicity and other effects in animals 
the results of preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  among other information  are submitted to the fda as part of an ind application 
subject to certain exceptions  an ind becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within the day time period  issues a clinical hold to delay a proposed clinical investigation due to concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial  including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
our submission of an ind  or those of our collaboration partners  may not result in the fda authorization to commence a clinical trial 
a separate submission to an existing ind must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development 
the fda must also approve changes to an existing ind 
further  an independent institutional review board  or irb  for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed 
the fda  the irb or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
clinical testing also must satisfy extensive good clinical practice requirements and regulations for informed consent 
clinical trials for purposes of nda submission and approval  clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases  which may overlap although additional or different trials may be required by the fda as well phase i clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety  dose tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion in healthy humans or  on occasion  in patients  such as cancer patients 
in some cases  particularly in cancer trials  a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a phase ib evaluation  which is a second safety focused phase i clinical trial typically designed to evaluate the impact of the drug candidate in combination with currently fda approved drugs 
phase ii clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage 
multiple phase ii clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase iii clinical trials 
in some cases  a sponsor may decide to conduct what is referred to as a phase iib evaluation  which is a second  confirmatory phase ii clinical trial that could  if positive and accepted by the fda  serve as a pivotal clinical trial in the approval of a drug candidate 
phase iii clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal trials 
when phase ii clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase iii clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage  to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple  geographically dispersed clinical trial sites 
in some cases  the fda may condition continued approval of an nda on the sponsor s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials with due diligence 
in other cases  the sponsor and the fda may agree that additional safety and or efficacy data should be provided  however  continued approval of the nda may not always depend on timely submission of such information 
such post approval studies are typically referred to as phase iv studies 
new drug application the results of drug candidate development  preclinical testing and clinical trials  together with  among other things  detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product and proposed labeling  and the payment of a user fee  are submitted to the fda as part of an nda 
the fda reviews all ndas submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an nda for filing 
once an nda is accepted for filing  the fda begins an in depth review of the application 
during its review of an nda  the fda may refer the application to an advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda may refuse to approve an nda and issue a not approvable letter if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or it may require additional clinical or other data  including one or more additional pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
even if such data are submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we or our collaboration partners interpret data 
if the fda s evaluations of the nda and the clinical and manufacturing procedures and facilities are favorable  the fda may issue either an approval letter or an approvable letter  which contains the conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the nda 
if and when those conditions have been met to the fda s satisfaction  the fda will issue an approval letter  authorizing commercial marketing of the drug for certain indications 
the fda may withdraw drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market 
in addition  the fda may require testing  including phase iv clinical trials  and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved products that have been commercialized  and the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post marketing programs 
drugs may be marketed only for the fda approved indications and in accordance with the fda approved label 
further  if there are any modifications to the drug  including changes in indications  other labeling changes  or manufacturing processes or facilities  we may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new nda or nda supplement  which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
section b new drug applications as an alternate path to fda approval of  for example  new indications or improved formulations of previously approved products  under certain circumstances a company may submit a section b nda  instead of a stand alone or full b nda 
section b of the fdca was enacted as part of the drug price competition and patent term restoration act of  otherwise known as the hatch waxman act 
section b permits the submission of an nda where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
for example  the hatch waxman act permits an applicant to rely upon the fda s findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product 
the fda may also require companies to perform one or more additional studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product 
the fda may then approve the new formulation for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved  or a new indication sought by the section b applicant 
to the extent that the section b applicant is relying on the fda s findings for an already approved product  the applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the fda s orange book publication 
specifically  the applicant must certify that the required patent information has not been filed paragraph i certification  the listed patent has expired paragraph ii certification  the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration paragraph iii certification  or the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  use or sale of the new product paragraph iv certification 
if the applicant does not challenge the listed patents  the section b application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired  and once any pediatric exclusivity expires 
the section b application may also not be approved until any non patent exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired 
if the applicant has provided a paragraph iv certification to the fda  the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph iv certification to the nda holder and patent owner once the nda has been accepted for filing by the fda 
the nda holder and patent owner may then initiate a legal challenge to the paragraph iv certification 
the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within days of their receipt of a paragraph iv certification automatically prevents the fda from approving the section b nda until the earliest of months  expiration of the patent  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in an infringement case that is favorable to the section b applicant 
thus  a section b applicant may invest a significant amount of time and expense in the development of its products only to be subject to significant delay and patent litigation before its products may be commercialized 
alternatively  if the nda holder or patent owner does not file a patent infringement lawsuit within the required day period  the applicant s nda will not be subject to the month stay 
notwithstanding the approval of many products by the fda pursuant to section b  over the last few years  certain brand name pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the fda s interpretation of section b 
if the fda changes its interpretation of section b  this could delay or even prevent the fda from approving any section b nda that we submit 
we submitted a section b nda for zensana in the second quarter of the safety and efficacy of the drug will be based on a demonstration of the bioequivalence of zensana to oral ondansetron  marketed under the tradename zofran 
this zofran formulation is protected by two patents  one of which expired in june  and was subject to a period of pediatric exclusivity expiring in december the second patent is scheduled to expire in september  and is subject to a period of pediatric exclusivity expiring in march the hatch waxman act under the hatch waxman act  newly approved drugs and new conditions of use may benefit from a statutory period of non patent marketing exclusivity 
the hatch waxman act provides five year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an nda for a new chemical entity  meaning that the fda has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active entity 
the hatch waxman act prohibits the submission of an abbreviated nda  or anda  or a section b nda for another version of such drug during the five year exclusive period  however  submission of a section b nda or an anda for a generic version of a previously approved drug containing a paragraph iv certification is permitted after four years  which may trigger a month stay of approval of the anda or section b nda 
protection under the hatch waxman act does not prevent the submission or approval of another full b nda  however  the applicant would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate and well controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness 
the hatch waxman act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental ndas  including section b ndas  for  among other things  new indications  dosages  or strengths of an existing drug  if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are essential to the approval of the application 
some of our product candidates may qualify for hatch waxman non patent marketing exclusivity 
in addition to non patent marketing exclusivity  the hatch waxman act amended the fdca to require each nda sponsor to submit with its application information on any patent that claims the drug for which the applicant submitted the nda or that claims a method of using such drug and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture  use  or sale of the drug 
generic applicants that wish to rely on the approval of a drug listed in the orange book must certify to each listed patent  as discussed above 
we intend to submit for orange book listing all relevant patents for our product candidates 
finally  the hatch waxman act amended the patent laws so that certain patents related to products regulated by the fda are eligible for a patent term extension if patent life was lost during a period when the product was undergoing regulatory review  and if certain criteria are met 
we intend to seek patent term extensions  provided our patents and products  if they are approved  meet applicable eligibility requirements 
pediatric studies and exclusivity the fdca provides an additional six months of non patent marketing exclusivity and patent protection for any such protections listed in the orange book for new or marketed drugs if a sponsor conducts specific pediatric studies at the written request of the fda 
the pediatric research equity act of  or prea  authorizes the fda to require pediatric studies for drugs to ensure the drugs safety and efficacy in children 
prea requires that certain new ndas or nda supplements contain data assessing the safety and effectiveness for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric subpopulations 
dosing and administration must be supported for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective 
the fda may also require this data for approved drugs that are used in pediatric patients for the labeled indication  or where there may be therapeutic benefits over existing products 
the fda may grant deferrals for submission of data  or full or partial waivers from prea 
prea pediatric assessments may qualify for pediatric exclusivity 
unless otherwise required by regulation  prea does not apply to any drug for an indication with orphan designation 
we may also seek pediatric exclusivity for conducting any required pediatric assessments 
orphan drug designation and exclusivity the fda may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition  which generally is a disease or condition that affects fewer than  individuals in the united states 
orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an nda 
if the fda grants orphan drug designation  which it may not  the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are publicly disclosed by the fda 
orphan drug designation does not convey an advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the review and approval process 
if a product which has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first fda approval for the indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to seven years of orphan drug exclusivity  meaning that the fda may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years  except in limited circumstances  such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity superior efficacy  safety  or a major contribution to patient care 
orphan drug designation does not prevent competitors from developing or marketing different drugs for that indication 
we received orphan drug status for talvesta in may and for marqibo in january  in both cases for the treatment of all 
under european union medicines laws  the criteria for designating a product as an orphan medicine are similar but somewhat different from those in the united states 
a drug is designated as an orphan drug if the sponsor can establish that the drug is intended for a life threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in  persons in the european union or that is unlikely to be profitable  and if there is no approved satisfactory treatment or if the drug would be a significant benefit to those persons with the condition 
orphan medicines are entitled to ten years of marketing exclusivity  except under certain limited circumstances comparable to united states law 
during this period of marketing exclusivity  no similar product  whether or not supported by full safety and efficacy data  will be approved unless a second applicant can establish that its product is safer  more effective or otherwise clinically superior 
this period may be reduced to six years if the conditions that originally justified orphan designation change or the sponsor makes excessive profits 
fast track designation the fda s fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and to expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition and that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
under the fast track program  applicants may seek traditional approval for a product based on data demonstrating an effect on a clinically meaningful endpoint  or approval based on a well established surrogate endpoint 
the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the fda to designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug at the time of original submission of its ind  or at any time thereafter prior to receiving marketing approval of a marketing application 
the fda will determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within days of receipt of the sponsor s request 
if the fda grants fast track designation  it may initiate review of sections of an nda before the application is complete 
this so called rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the fda approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant has paid applicable user fees 
the fda s pdufa review clock for both a standard and priority nda for a fast track product does not begin until the complete application is submitted 
additionally  fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by emerging data  or if the designated drug development program is no longer being pursued 
in some cases  a fast track designated drug candidate may also qualify for one or more of the following programs priority review 
as explained above  a drug candidate may be eligible for a six month priority review 
the fda assigns priority review status to an application if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of a disease 
a fast track drug would ordinarily meet the fda s criteria for priority review  but may also be assigned a standard review 
we do not know whether any of our drug candidates will be assigned priority review status or  if priority review status is assigned  whether that review or approval will be faster than conventional fda procedures  or that the fda will ultimately approve the drug 
accelerated approval 
under the fda s accelerated approval regulations  the fda is authorized to approve drug candidates that have been studied for their safety and efficacy in treating serious or life threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than patient survival or irreversible morbidity 
in clinical trials  surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms 
a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post marketing compliance requirements  including the completion of phase iv or post approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
failure to conduct required post approval studies with due diligence  or to validate a surrogate endpoint or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies  may cause the fda to seek to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis 
all promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the fda 
when appropriate  we and our collaboration partners intend to seek fast track designation  accelerated approval or priority review for our product candidates 
we cannot predict whether any of our product candidates will obtain fast track  accelerated approval  or priority review designation  or the ultimate impact  if any  of these expedited review mechanisms on the timing or likelihood of the fda approval of any of our product candidates 
satisfaction of the fda regulations and approval requirements or similar requirements of foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years  and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or disease 
typically  if a drug candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease  as is the case with some of the product candidates we are developing  safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities 
the fda or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for changes in dosage form or new indications for our product candidates on a timely basis  or at all 
even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval  the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states  patient populations and dosages 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market 
delays in obtaining  or failures to obtain  regulatory approvals for any of our product candidates would harm our business 
in addition  we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future united states or foreign governmental action 
special protocol assessment the fdca directs the fda to meet with sponsors  pursuant to a sponsor s written request  for the purpose of reaching agreement on the design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim in an nda 
if an agreement is reached  the fda will reduce the agreement to writing and make it part of the administrative record 
this agreement is called a special protocol assessment  or spa 
while the fda s guidance on spas states that documented spas should be considered binding on the review division  the fda has the latitude to change its assessment if certain exceptions apply 
exceptions include identification of a substantial scientific issue essential to safety or efficacy testing that later comes to light  a sponsor s failure to follow the protocol agreed upon  or the fda s reliance on data  assumptions or information that are determined to be wrong 
other regulatory requirements any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaboration partners pursuant to future fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug 
drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register with the fda and certain state agencies  and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements  including cgmp  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as warning letters  suspension of manufacturing  sales or use  seizure of product  injunctive action or possible civil penalties 
we cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cgmp regulations and other ongoing fda regulatory requirements 
if our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements  the fda may halt our clinical trials  require us to recall a drug from distribution  or withdraw approval of the nda for that drug 
the fda closely regulates the post approval marketing and promotion of drugs  including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet 
a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the fda 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity  warning and or untitled letters  corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties 
foreign regulation in addition to regulations in the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country  and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials  product licensing  pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country 
under european union regulatory systems  marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized or mutual recognition procedure 
the centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all european union member states 
the mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions 
under this procedure  the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states 
within days of receiving the applications and assessment report  each member state must decide whether to recognize approval 
in addition to regulations in europe and the united states  we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future products 
reimbursement in many of the markets where we intend to commercialize a product following regulatory approval  the prices of pharmaceutical products are subject to direct price controls by law and to drug reimbursement programs with varying price control mechanisms 
in the united states  there has been an increased focus on drug pricing in recent years 
although there are currently no direct government price controls over private sector purchases in the united states  federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay prescribed rebates on certain drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under certain public health care programs such as medicaid 
various states have adopted further mechanisms under medicaid and otherwise that seek to control drug prices  including by disfavoring certain higher priced drugs and by seeking supplemental rebates from manufacturers 
managed care has also become a potent force in the market place that increases downward pressure on the prices of pharmaceutical products 
federal legislation  enacted in december  has altered the way in which physician administered drugs covered by medicare are reimbursed 
under the new reimbursement methodology  physicians are reimbursed based on a product s average sales price  or asp 
this new reimbursement methodology has generally led to lower reimbursement levels 
the new federal legislation also has added an outpatient prescription drug benefit to medicare  effective january in the interim  congress has established a discount drug card program for medicare beneficiaries 
both benefits will be provided primarily through private entities  which will attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers 
public and private health care payors control costs and influence drug pricing through a variety of mechanisms  including through negotiating discounts with the manufacturers and through the use of tiered formularies and other mechanisms that provide preferential access to certain drugs over others within a therapeutic class 
payors also set other criteria to govern the uses of a drug that will be deemed medically appropriate and therefore reimbursed or otherwise covered 
in particular  many public and private health care payors limit reimbursement and coverage to the uses of a drug that are either approved by the fda or that are supported by other appropriate evidence for example  published medical literature and appear in a recognized drug compendium 
drug compendia are publications that summarize the available medical evidence for particular drug products and identify which uses of a drug are supported or not supported by the available evidence  whether or not such uses have been approved by the fda 
for example  in the case of medicare coverage for physician administered oncology drugs  the omnibus budget reconciliation act of  with certain exceptions  prohibits medicare carriers from refusing to cover unapproved uses of an fda approved drug if the unapproved use is supported by one or more citations in the american hospital formulary service drug information  the american medical association drug evaluations  or the us pharmacopoeia drug information 
another commonly cited compendium  for example under medicaid  is the drugdex information system 
different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries 
for example  in the european union  governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of such products to consumers 
the approach taken varies from member state to member state 
some jurisdictions operate positive and or negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed 
other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines  but monitor and control company profits 
the downward pressure on health care costs in general  particularly prescription drugs  has become very intense 
as a result  increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products  as exemplified by the national institute for clinical excellence in the uk  which evaluates the data supporting new medicines and passes reimbursement recommendations to the government 
in addition  in some countries cross border imports from low priced markets parallel imports exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country 
competition we compete primarily in the segment of the biopharmaceutical market that addresses cancer and cancer supportive care  which is highly competitive 
we face significant competition from many pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are researching and selling products designed to address cancer this market 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and drug development resources than we do 
large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive experience in clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs 
these companies also have significantly greater research capabilities than we do 
in addition  many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research 
we also compete with commercial biotechnology companies for the rights to product candidates developed by public and private research institutes 
smaller or early stage companies are also significant competitors  particularly those with collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things our ability to develop novel compounds with attractive pharmaceutical properties and to secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations  the efficacy  safety and reliability of our product candidates  the speed at which we develop our product candidates  our ability to design and successfully complete appropriate clinical trials  our ability to maintain a good relationship with regulatory authorities  the timing and scope of regulatory approvals  our ability to manufacture and sell commercial quantities of future products to the market  and acceptance of future products by physicians and other healthcare providers 
employees as of march   we employed persons  all of whom are based at our south san francisco office 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors investment in our common stock involves significant risk 
you should carefully consider the information described in the following risk factors  together with the other information appearing elsewhere in this report  before making an investment decision regarding our common stock 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial conditions  results of operation and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected 
in these circumstances  the market price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or a part of your investment in our common stock 
moreover  the risks described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business  operating results  prospects or financial condition 
risks related to our business we are a development stage company with a limited operating history and may not be able to commercialize any products  generate significant revenues or attain profitability 
we are a development stage company with a limited operating history 
we have never generated revenue and have incurred significant net losses in each year since our inception 
we expect to incur substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future  and we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
for the year ended december   we had net losses of million 
from our inception in december through december   we have incurred an aggregate net loss of million 
we expect our cash requirements to increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to undertake preclinical development and  if and when permitted by appropriate regulatory agencies  clinical trials for our current and new product candidates  seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates at the appropriate time in the future  implement additional internal systems and infrastructure  seek to acquire additional technologies to develop  and hire additional personnel 
we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future as we fund our operations and capital expenditures 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues in order to achieve and maintain profitability 
even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates  which success is not assured  we may not be able to generate significant revenues 
even if we do generate significant revenues  we may never achieve or maintain profitability 
our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the trading price of our common stock 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when needed  we may have to discontinue our product development programs or relinquish our rights to some or all of our product candidates 
the manner in which we raise any additional funds may affect the value of your investment in our common stock 
we expect to incur losses at least until we can successfully commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
we expect that we will require additional financing to fund our development programs and to expand our infrastructure and commercialization activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million in the year ended december  if we fail to obtain the necessary financing  we will not be able to fund our operations 
we have no committed sources of additional capital 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us when needed  if at all 
if we fail to advance our current product candidates to later stage clinical trials  successfully commercialize marqibo or acquire new product candidates for development  we will have difficulty obtaining additional financing 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including costs associated with conducting preclinical and clinical testing  costs associated with commercializing our lead programs  including establishing sales and marketing functions  costs of establishing arrangements for manufacturing our product candidates  costs of acquiring new drug candidates  payments required under our current and any future license agreements and collaborations  costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  costs of obtaining  maintaining and defending patents on our product candidates  and costs of increased general and administrative expenses 
to the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution 
we may grant future investors rights superior to those of our current stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  product candidates or products  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt  we could incur significant interest expense and become subject to covenants in the related transaction documentation that could affect the manner in which we conduct our business 
if we are unable to successfully reformulate zensana  we may not be able to obtain fda approval and commercialize this product candidate 
in march  we withdrew our nda for zensana because of our determination that the current formulation of zensana was unstable  causing the active ingredient to precipitate over long periods of time following manufacture 
through further investigation  we have determined that the precipitation issue in long term stability was not related to the manufacturing process  but is instead an issue with the original formulation 
our partner and licensor  novadel  has developed an alternate formulation of the product 
the alternate formulation is currently under active investigation and scale up 
we have stopped further investigation of the original formulation 
if this new formulation proves to be scaleable  we will then need to reestablish bioequivalency through new clinical trials 
if these studies are successful  we would not be in a position to file an nda until  at the earliest 
if we are unable to successfully reformulate zensana in a timely manner  we will be unable to commercialize zensna 
since we have no products available for sale  our failure to commercialize zensana may significantly harm our business 
if we fail to acquire and develop other product candidates we may be unable to grow our business 
we intend to acquire rights to develop and commercialize additional product candidates 
because we currently neither have nor intend to establish internal research capabilities  we are dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic and other researchers to sell or license us their product candidates 
the success of our strategy depends upon our ability to identify  select and acquire pharmaceutical product candidates 
proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable product acquisition or license is a lengthy and complex process 
we compete for partnering arrangements and license agreements with pharmaceutical  biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  many of which have significantly more experience than us and have significantly more financial resources than we do 
our competitors may have stronger relationships with certain third parties with whom we are interested in partnering  such as academic research institutions  and may  therefore  have a competitive advantage in entering into partnering arrangements with those third parties 
we may not be able to acquire rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
we expect that any product candidate to which we acquire rights will require significant additional development and other efforts prior to commercial sale  including extensive clinical testing and approval by the fda and applicable foreign regulatory authorities 
all product candidates are subject to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe or effective for approval by regulatory authorities 
even if our product candidates are approved  they may not be manufactured or produced economically or commercialized successfully 
if we are unable to successfully manage our growth  our business may be harmed 
in the future  if we are able to advance our product candidates to the point of  and thereafter through  clinical trials  we will need to expand our development  regulatory  manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities 
any future growth will place a significant strain on our management and on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend  in part  on our ability to manage any future growth effectively 
we are actively evaluating additional product candidates to acquire for development 
such additional product candidates  if any  could significantly increase our capital requirements and place further strain on the time of our existing personnel  which may delay or otherwise adversely affect the development of our existing product candidates 
we must manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively  and hire  train and integrate additional management  administrative and sales and marketing personnel 
we may not be able to accomplish these tasks  and our failure to accomplish any of them could prevent us from successfully growing hana 
we rely on key executive officers and their experience and knowledge of our business would be difficult to replace in the event any of them left hana 
we are highly dependent on mark ahn  our president and chief executive officer  fred vitale  our vice president and chief business officer  gregory berk  our senior vice president and chief medical officer  and john iparraguirre  our vice president and chief financial officer 
dr 
ahn s  mr 
vitale s  dr 
berk s and mr 
iparraguirre s employment are governed by written employment agreements  each of which have terms that expire in november dr 
ahn  mr 
vitale  dr 
berk and mr 
iparraguirre may terminate their employment with us at any time  subject  however  to certain non solicitation covenants 
the loss of the technical knowledge and management and industry expertise that would result in the event dr 
ahn left hana could result in delays in the development of our product candidates  and divert management resources 
the loss of mr 
vitale could impair our ability to expand our product development pipeline and commercialize our product candidates  which may harm our business prospects 
the loss of dr 
berk could impair our ability to initiate new and sustain existing clinical trials  as well as identify potential product candidates 
the loss of mr 
iparraguirre could impair our ability to obtain additional financing and to accurately and timely file our periodic and other reports with the sec 
we do not carry key person life insurance for any of our officers or key employees 
if we are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  our ability to grow our business may be harmed 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in preclinical testing  clinical research and testing  government regulation  formulation and manufacturing and sales and marketing 
we compete for qualified individuals with numerous biopharmaceutical companies  universities and other research institutions 
competition for such individuals  particularly in the san francisco bay area where we are headquartered  is intense  and we cannot be certain that our search for such personnel will be successful 
our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel is critical to our success 
we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our products in response to product liability lawsuits 
the testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products entail an inherent risk of product liability 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates  if approved 
even successful defense would require significant financial and management resources 
regardless of the merit or eventual outcome  liability claims may result in decreased demand for our product candidates  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial participants  withdrawal of prior governmental approvals  costs of related litigation  substantial monetary awards to patients  product recalls  loss of revenue  and the inability to commercialize our product candidates 
our inability to obtain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of pharmaceutical products we develop  alone or with collaborators 
we currently do not carry product liability insurance but instead maintain a million clinical trial insurance policy for our ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates 
even if our agreements with any future collaborators entitle us to indemnification against damages from product liability claims  such indemnification may not be available or adequate should any claim arise 
we may experience difficulty integrating our newly acquired product candidates into our business 
in may  we licensed the rights to develop and commercialize three sphingosomal product candidates  including marqibo  from inex pharmaceuticals corporation  which at that time doubled the size of our product candidate pipeline 
we have recently initiated a phase i trial of alocrest in solid tumors and plan to initiate a phase ii  open label trial in relapsed adult all in marqibo in we also plan to conduct a phase iii clinical trial in front line all of marqibo in in october  we also licensed our rights to topical menadione  a pre clinical product candidate 
we need fda and other approvals before we can pursue our planned clinical trials of marqibo and our other new product candidates and there is no assurance we will be able to obtain such approvals 
moreover  we will be required to devote substantial capital and personnel resources to our newly acquired product candidates in order to attempt to successfully continue their development 
if we fail to devote sufficient resources to the development of these product candidates  or if our focus on the new product candidates diverts our attention from the development of zensana and other product candidates  we will not realize the intended benefits from the recently completed transactions and our business will suffer 
risks related to the clinical testing  regulatory approval and manufacturing of our product candidates if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval to sell our lead product candidate  marqibo  or any of our other product candidates  our business will suffer 
in may  we licensed marqibo from inex 
marqibo is not currently permitted to be commercially used 
inex submitted an nda pursuant to section b for accelerated marketing approval of marqibo primarily based upon a single arm  phase ii clinical trial  which was reviewed by the fda in and in january  the fda issued a not approvable letter to inex for the marqibo nda for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory nhl previously treated with at least two chemotherapy regimens 
the fda s not approvable letter cited a variety of reasons for not approving the nda  including the following the information presented by inex was inadequate and contained clinical deficiencies  the information presented by inex failed to provide evidence of an effect on a surrogate that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit  the information presented by inex contained chemistry  manufacturing and control deficiencies  a supportive study in nhl patients and all patients was not well conducted or well controlled  and the information presented by inex did not demonstrate an improvement over available therapy 
in rejecting the nda  the fda recommended that  if inex planned to pursue development of marqibo for the treatment of relapsed refractory nhl  inex should conduct additional studies  including but not limited to randomized controlled studies comparing marqibo to other chemotherapy regimens 
even if such studies are successfully performed  marqibo may not receive fda approval 
with respect to marqibo and any of our other product candidates  additional fda regulatory risks exist which may prevent fda approval of these drug candidates and thereby prevent their commercial use 
additionally  if marqibo or any of our product candidates are approved by the fda  such approval may be withdrawn by the fda for a variety of reasons  including that clinical or other experience  tests  or other scientific data show that the drug is unsafe for use  that new evidence of clinical experience or evidence from new tests  evaluated together with the evidence available to the fda when the nda was approved  shows that the drug is not shown to be safe for use under the approved conditions of use  that on the basis of new information presented to the fda  there is a lack of substantial evidence that the drug will have the effect it purports or is represented to have under the approved conditions of use  that an nda contains any untrue statement of a material fact  or for a drug approved under fda s accelerated approval regulations or as a fast track drug  if any required post approval study is not conducted with due diligence or if such study fails to verify the clinical benefit of the drug 
other regulatory risks may arise as a result of a change in applicable law or regulation or the interpretation thereof  and may result in material modification or withdrawal of prior fda approvals 
many of our product candidates are in early stages of clinical trials  which are very expensive and time consuming 
any failure or delay in completing clinical trials for our product candidates could harm our business 
our four other product candidates  talvesta  alocrest  sphingosome encapsulated topotecan  and topical menadione are in early stages of development and will require extensive clinical and other testing and analysis before we will be in a position to consider seeking fda approval to sell such product candidates 
see item description of business our cancer therapeutic product pipeline  and our supportive care product pipeline 
in addition to the risks set forth above for zensana and marqibo  which also apply to talvesta  alocrest  sphingosome encapsulated topotecan and topical menadione  these product candidates also have additional risks as each is in an earlier stage of development and review 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and very expensive process and the results are inherently uncertain 
the duration of clinical trials can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of our product candidates will take at least several years to complete 
the completion of clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed or prevented by many factors  including delays in patient enrollment  and variability in the number and types of patients available for clinical trials  difficulty in maintaining contact with patients after treatment  resulting in incomplete data  poor effectiveness of product candidates during clinical trials  safety issues  side effects  or other adverse events  results that do not demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates  governmental or regulatory delays and changes in regulatory requirements  policy and guidelines  and varying interpretation of data by the fda 
in conducting clinical trials  we may fail to establish the effectiveness of a compound for the targeted indication or discover that it is unsafe due to unforeseen side effects or other reasons 
even if our clinical trials are commenced and completed as planned  their results may not support our product candidate claims 
further  failure of product candidate development can occur at any stage of the clinical trials  or even thereafter  and we could encounter problems that cause us to abandon or repeat clinical trials 
these problems could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials for our product candidates and could result in fda  or other regulatory authorities  delaying approval of our product candidates for any or all indications 
the results from preclinical testing and prior clinical trials may not be predictive of results obtained in later or other larger clinical trials 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry have suffered significant setbacks in clinical trials  even in advanced clinical trials after showing promising results in earlier clinical trials 
our failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of any of our product candidates will prevent us from receiving regulatory approval to market these product candidates and will negatively impact our business 
in addition  we or the fda may suspend or curtail our clinical trials at any time if it appears that we are exposing participants to unacceptable health risks or if the fda finds deficiencies in the conduct of these clinical trials or in the composition  manufacture or administration of the product candidates 
accordingly  we cannot predict with any certainty when or if we will ever be in a position to submit an nda for any of our product candidates  or whether any such nda would ever be approved 
if we do not obtain the necessary us or foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates  we will not be able to market and sell our product candidates 
none of our product candidates have been approved for commercial sale in any country 
fda approval is required to commercialize all of our product candidates in the united states and approvals from the fda equivalent regulatory authorities are required in foreign jurisdictions in order to commercialize our product candidates in those jurisdictions 
we only possess the right to attempt to develop and commercialize zensana within the united states and canada 
we possess world wide rights to develop and commercialize marqibo and our other product candidates 
in order to obtain fda approval of any of our product candidates  we must submit to the fda an nda  demonstrating that the product candidate is safe for humans and effective for its intended use and otherwise meets the requirements of existing laws and regulations governing new drugs 
this demonstration requires significant research and animal tests  which are referred to as preclinical studies  and human tests  which are referred to as clinical trials  as well as additional information and studies 
satisfaction of the fda s regulatory requirements typically takes many years  depending on the type  complexity and novelty of the product candidate and requires substantial resources for research  development and testing as well as for other purposes 
to date  none of our product candidates has been approved for sale in the united states or in any foreign market 
we cannot predict whether our research and clinical approaches will result in drugs that the fda considers safe for humans and effective for indicated uses 
historically  only a small percentage of all drug candidates that start clinical trials are eventually approved by the fda for sale 
after clinical trials are completed  the fda has substantial discretion in the drug approval process and may require us to conduct additional preclinical and clinical testing or to perform post marketing studies 
the approval process may also be delayed by changes in government regulation  future legislation or administrative action or changes in fda policy that occur prior to or during our regulatory review 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may delay or prevent commercialization of  and our ability to derive product revenues from  our product candidates  impose costly procedures on us  reduce the potential prices we may be able to charge for our product candidates  assuming they are approved for sale  and diminish any competitive advantages that we may otherwise enjoy 
even if we comply with all fda requests  the fda may ultimately reject one or more of our ndas 
we cannot be sure that we will ever obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates 
additionally  a change in applicable law or regulation  or the interpretation thereof  may result in material modification or withdrawal of prior fda approvals 
failure to obtain fda approval of any of our product candidates will severely undermine our business by reducing our number of saleable products and  therefore  corresponding product revenues 
if we do not complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate  we will not be able to recover any of the substantial costs invested by us in the development of the product candidate 
in foreign jurisdictions  we must receive approval from the appropriate regulatory authorities before we can commercialize our drugs 
foreign regulatory approval processes generally include all of the risks associated with the fda approval procedures described above 
we cannot assure you that we will receive the approvals necessary to commercialize any of our product candidates for sale outside the united states 
our competitive position may be harmed if a competitor obtains orphan drug designation and approval for the treatment of all for a clinically superior drug 
orphan drug designation is an important element of our competitive strategy because the latest of our licensors patents for talvesta expires in in may  the fda approved our application for orphan drug designation for the use of talvesta in treating all 
the company that obtains the first fda approval for a designated orphan drug for a rare disease generally receives marketing exclusivity for use of that drug for the designated condition for a period of seven years 
however  even though we obtained orphan drug status for talvesta in the treatment of all  the fda may permit other companies to market a drug for the same designated and approved condition during our period of orphan drug exclusivity if it can be demonstrated that the drug is clinically superior to our drug 
this could create a more competitive market for us 
even if we obtain regulatory approvals for our products  the terms of approvals and ongoing monitoring and regulation of our products may limit how we manufacture and market our products  which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue 
even if regulatory approval is granted in the united states or in a foreign country  the approved product and its manufacturer  as well as others involved in the manufacturing and packaging process  remain subject to continual regulatory review and monitoring 
any regulatory approval that we receive for a product candidate may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed  or include requirements for potentially costly post approval clinical trials 
in addition  if the fda and or foreign regulatory agencies approve any of our product candidates  the labeling  packaging  storage  advertising  promotion  recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post marketing information on the product will be subject to extensive regulatory requirements which may change over time 
we and the manufacturers of our products  their ingredients  and many aspects of the packaging are also required to comply with current good manufacturing practice regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
further  regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our products or their ingredients or certain packagings  and these facilities are subject to ongoing regulatory inspection 
discovery of problems with a product or manufacturer may result in restrictions or sanctions with respect to the product  manufacturer and relevant manufacturing facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
if we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements of the fda and other applicable foreign regulatory authorities  or if problems with our products  manufacturers or manufacturing processes are discovered  we could be subject to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions  including restrictions on the products  manufacturers or manufacturing process  warning letters or untitled letters  civil or criminal penalties or fines  injunctions  product seizures  detentions or import bans  voluntary or mandatory product recalls and publicity requirements  suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals  total or partial suspension of production and or sale  and refusal to approve pending applications for marketing approval of new drugs or supplements to approved applications 
in order to market any products outside of the united states  we must establish and comply with the numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy 
approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from that required to obtain fda approval 
regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another  but failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may have a negative effect on the regulatory process in others 
because we are dependent on clinical research institutions and other contractors for clinical testing and for research and development activities  the results of our clinical trials and such research activities are  to a certain extent  beyond our control 
we depend upon independent investigators and collaborators  such as universities and medical institutions  to conduct our preclinical and clinical trials under agreements with us 
for example  our current phase i clinical trial for talvesta is being conducted by dana farber cancer institute  inc  massachusetts general hospital and beth israel deaconess hospital 
these parties are not our employees and we cannot control the amount or timing of resources that they devote to our programs 
these investigators may not assign as great a priority to our programs or pursue them as diligently as we would if we were undertaking such programs ourselves 
if outside collaborators fail to devote sufficient time and resources to our drug development programs  or if their performance is substandard  the approval of our fda applications  if any  and our introduction of new drugs  if any  will be delayed 
these collaborators may also have relationships with other commercial entities  some of whom may compete with us 
if our collaborators assist our competitors at our expense  our competitive position would be harmed 
our reliance on third parties to formulate and manufacture our product candidates exposes us to a number of risks that may delay the development  regulatory approval and commercialization of our products or result in higher product costs 
we have no experience in drug formulation or manufacturing and do not intend to establish our own manufacturing facilities 
we lack the resources and expertise to formulate or manufacture our own product candidates 
we contract with one or more manufacturers to manufacture  supply  store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials 
if any of our product candidates receive fda approval  we will rely on one or more third party contractors to manufacture our drugs 
rechon life science ltd 
formerly ferring ab supplied us with our clinical supplies of zensana  including the spray pump and oral applicator used to deliver the drug 
we have not entered into an agreement with rechon life science ltd 
or any other third party for the commercial manufacture of zensana but expect to do so with rechon life science ltd 
if and when we obtain regulatory approval to market and sell zensana 
our anticipated future reliance on a limited number of third party manufacturers exposes us to the following risks we may be unable to identify manufacturers on acceptable terms or at all because the number of potential manufacturers is limited and the fda must approve any replacement contractor 
this approval would require new testing and compliance inspections 
in addition  a new manufacturer would have to be educated in  or develop substantially equivalent processes for  production of our products after receipt of fda approval  if any 
our third party manufacturers might be unable to formulate and manufacture our drugs in the volume and of the quality required to meet our clinical and or commercial needs  if any 
our future contract manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required to supply our clinical trials or to successfully produce  store and distribute our products 
drug manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspection by the fda and corresponding state agencies to ensure strict compliance with good manufacturing practice and other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
we do not have control over third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards  but we will be ultimately responsible for any of their failures 
if any third party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our products  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to the innovation 
this may prohibit us from seeking alternative or additional manufacturers for our products 
each of these risks could delay our clinical trials  the approval  if any  of our product candidates by the fda  or the commercialization of our product candidates or result in higher costs or deprive us of potential product revenues 
risks related to our ability to commercialize our product candidates our success depends substantially on marqibo  which is still under development and requires further regulatory approvals 
if we are unable to commercialize marqibo  or experience significant delays in doing so  our ability to generate product revenue and our likelihood of success will be diminished 
we intend to commence a phase ii  open label trial in relapsed adult all and a phase iii trial in front line all of marqibo during a significant portion of our time and financial resources for at least the next twelve months will be used in the development of this program 
we anticipate that our ability to generate revenues in the near term will depend solely on the successful development  regulatory approval and commercialization of marqibo 
all of our other product candidates are in the very early stages of development 
any of our product candidates could be unsuccessful if they do not demonstrate acceptable safety and efficacy in preclinical studies or clinical trials or otherwise do not meet applicable regulatory standards for approval  do not offer therapeutic or other improvements over existing or future therapies used to treat the same conditions  are not capable of being produced in commercial quantities at acceptable costs or pursuant to applicable rules and regulations  or are not accepted in the medical community and by third party payors 
if we are unable to commercialize our product candidates  we will not generate product revenues 
the results of our clinical trials to date do not provide assurance that acceptable efficacy or safety will be shown 
if we are unable either to create sales  marketing and distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform these functions  we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates successfully 
we currently have no sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
to commercialize our product candidates  we must either develop internal sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  which will be expensive and time consuming  or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services 
if we decide to market any of our products directly  we must commit financial and managerial resources to develop marketing capabilities and a sales force with technical expertise and with supporting distribution capabilities 
other factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our product candidates  if approved  directly and without strategic partners include our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel  the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products  the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines  and unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization 
if we are not able to partner with a third party and are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel or in building a sales and marketing infrastructure  we will have difficulty commercializing our product candidates  which would harm our business 
if we rely on pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies with established distribution systems to market our products  we will need to establish and maintain partnership arrangements  and we may not be able to enter into these arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other arrangements  any revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties which may not be successful and which will be only partially in our control 
our product revenues would likely be lower than if we marketed and sold our products directly 
the terms of our license agreements relating to intellectual property ownership rights may make it more difficult for us to establish collaborations for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of our license agreements obligate us to include intellectual property assignment provisions in any sublicenses or collaboration agreements that may be unacceptable to our potential sublicensees and partners 
these terms may impede our ability to enter into partnerships for some of our existing product candidates 
under our license agreement with inex  inex  either alone or jointly with md anderson cancer center  will be the owner of patents and patent applications claiming priority to certain patents licensed to us  and we not only have an obligation to assign to inex our rights to inventions covered by such patents or patent applications  but also  when negotiating any joint venture  collaborative research  development  commercialization or other agreement with a third party  to require such third party to do the same 
our license agreement with elan pharmaceuticals  inc  or elan  relating to marqibo  provides that elan will own all improvements to the licensed patents or licensed know how made by us or any of our sublicensees 
our license agreement with novadel for zensana provides that all information and inventions made by or on behalf of us  our affiliates and sublicenses relating to the oral spray process or zensana will be assigned to novadel 
potential collaboration and commercialization partners for these product candidates may not agree to such intellectual property ownership requirements and therefore not elect to partner with us for these product candidates 
if physicians and patients do not accept and use our product candidates  our ability to generate revenue from sales of our products will be materially impaired 
even if the fda approves any of our product candidates  if physicians and patients do not accept and use them  our business will be adversely affected 
acceptance and use of our products will depend upon a number of factors including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  about the safety and effectiveness of our drugs  pharmacological benefit and cost effectiveness of our products relative to competing products  availability of reimbursement for our products from government or other healthcare payors  effectiveness of marketing and distribution efforts by us and our licensees and distributors  if any  and the price at which we sell our products 
adequate coverage and reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates  which could diminish our sales or affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
market acceptance and sales of our product candidates will depend in significant part on the levels at which government payors and other third party payors  such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations  cover and pay for our products 
we cannot provide any assurances that third party payors will provide adequate coverage of and reimbursement for any of our product candidates 
if we are unable to obtain adequate coverage of and payment levels for our product candidates from third party payors  physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them 
this in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability and future success 
in both the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory policies and proposals in recent years to change the healthcare system in ways that could impact our ability to sell our products profitably 
on december   president bush signed into law the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of  or the mma  which contains  among other changes to the law  a wide variety of changes that impact medicare reimbursement of pharmaceuticals to physicians and hospitals 
the mma requires that  as of january   payment rates for most drugs covered under medicare part b  including drugs furnished incident to physicians services  are to be based on manufacturer s average sales price  or asp  of the product 
implementation of the asp payment methodology for drugs furnished in physician s offices generally resulted in reduced payments in  and could result in lower payment rates for drugs in the future 
the mma requires that  beginning in  payment amounts for most drugs administered in physician offices are to be based on either asp or on amounts bid by vendors under the competitive acquisition program  or cap 
under the cap  physicians who administer drugs in their offices will be offered an option to acquire drugs covered under the medicare part b benefit from vendors that are selected in a competitive bidding process 
winning vendors would be selected based on criteria that include their bid prices 
implementation of the cap has been delayed until at least july implementation of the asp payment methodology and the cap could negatively impact our ability to sell our product candidates 
the mma also revised the method by which medicare pays for many drugs administered in hospital outpatient departments beginning in in addition  the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  which administers the medicare program  published a proposed rule on payment amounts for drugs administered in hospital outpatient departments for as a result of the changes in the mma and  if the methods suggested by cms in the proposed rule are implemented  certain newly introduced drugs administered in hospital outpatient departments  which we believe would include our therapeutics and supportive care product candidates  will generally be reimbursed under an asp payment methodology  except that during a short introductory period in which drugs have not been assigned a billing code a higher payment rate is applicable 
as in the case of physician offices  implementation of the asp payment methodology in the hospital outpatient department could negatively impact our ability to sell our product candidates 
the mma created a new  voluntary prescription drug benefit for medicare beneficiaries  medicare part d  which took effect in medicare part d is a new type of coverage that allows for payment for certain prescription drugs not covered under part b 
this new benefit will be offered by private managed care organizations and freestanding prescription drug plans  which  subject to review and approval by cms  may  and are expected to  establish drug formularies and other drug utilization management controls based in part on the price at which they can obtain the drugs involved 
the drugs that will be covered in each therapeutic category and class on the formularies of participating part d plans may be limited  and obtaining favorable treatment on formularies and with respect to utilization management controls may affect the prices we can obtain for our products 
if our product candidates are not placed on such formularies  or are subject to utilization management controls  this could negatively impact our ability to sell them 
it is difficult to predict which of our candidate products will be placed on the formularies or subjected to utilization management controls and the impact that the part d program  and the mma generally  will have on us 
there also likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals that could bring about significant changes in the healthcare industry 
we cannot predict what form those changes might take or the impact on our business of any legislation or regulations that may be adopted in the future 
the implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue  attain profitability or commercialize our products 
in addition  in many foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union  the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control 
we may face competition for our product candidates from lower priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products 
in addition  there may be importation of foreign products that compete with our own products which could negatively impact our profitability 
if we cannot compete successfully for market share against other drug companies  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
the market for our product candidates is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advances 
if our product candidates receive fda approval  they will compete with a number of existing and future drugs and therapies developed  manufactured and marketed by others 
if approved  zensana will compete with the currently available oral form of ondansetron  which is currently being manufactured and sold by glaxosmithkline inc under the name zofran 
in addition  the fda may approve generic versions of ondansetron before and or after any action on the zensana marketing application with which we might compete 
if approved  marqibo will compete with unencapsulated vincristine  which is generic  other cytotoxic agents such as antimetabolites  alkylating agents  cytotoxic antibiotics  vinca alkyloids  platinum compounds and taxanes  and other cytotoxic agents that use different encapsulation technologies 
if approved  talvesta will compete with existing antifolate therapies currently being sold by pfizer  inc trimetrexate  eli lilly co 
pemetrexed and novartis ag edatrexate 
these or other future competing products and product candidates may provide greater therapeutic convenience or clinical or other benefits for a specific indication than our products  or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost 
if our products fail to capture and maintain market share  we may not achieve sufficient product revenues and our business will suffer 
we will compete against fully integrated pharmaceutical companies and smaller companies that are collaborating with larger pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  government agencies and other public and private research organizations 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  operate larger research and development programs and have substantially greater financial resources than we do  as well as significantly greater experience in developing drugs  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of drugs  formulating and manufacturing drugs  and launching  marketing and selling drugs 
developments by competitors may render our products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
companies that currently sell both generic and proprietary compounds for the treatment of cancer include  among others  pfizer  inc trimetrexate  eli lilly co 
pemetrexed  novartis ag edatrexate  and allos therapeutics  inc pdx 
alternative technologies are being developed to treat cancer and immunological disease  several of which are in advanced clinical trials 
in addition  companies pursuing different but related fields represent substantial competition 
many of these organizations have substantially greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities  longer drug development history in obtaining regulatory approvals and greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to attract qualified personnel  parties for acquisitions  joint ventures or other collaborations 
risks related to our intellectual property if we fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to patents of others  the value of our intellectual property rights would diminish 
our success  competitive position and future revenues will depend in large part on our ability and the abilities of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products  methods  processes and other technologies  to preserve our trade secrets  to prevent third parties from infringing on our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties 
we have licensed from third parties rights to numerous issued patents and patent applications 
to date  through our license agreements for talvesta  marqibo and zensana  we hold certain exclusive patent rights  including rights under us patents and us patent applications 
we also have patent rights to applications pending in several foreign jurisdictions 
we have filed and anticipate filing additional patent applications both in the united states and internationally  as appropriate 
the rights to product candidates that we acquire from licensors or collaborators are protected by patents and proprietary rights owned by them  and we rely on the patent protection and rights established or acquired by them 
we generally do not unilaterally control  or do not control at all  the prosecution of patent applications licensed from third parties 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we may exercise over internally developed intellectual property 
in particular  novadel  which licensed us zensana  has the sole right to file  prosecute and maintain patent applications  patents and trademarks relating to the zensana product  and we only have the right to comment on such filings and the rights to patent filing  prosecution and maintenance if novadel elects not to do so in a certain country 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
even if we are able to obtain patents  any patent may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented 
the existence of a patent will not necessarily protect us from competition 
competitors may successfully challenge our patents  produce similar drugs or products that do not infringe our patents or produce drugs in countries where we have not applied for patent protection or that do not respect our patents 
under our license agreements  we generally do not unilaterally control  or do not control at all  the enforcement of the licensed patents or the defense of third party suits of infringement or invalidity 
in particular  with respect to zensana  novadel is the party who has the first right to enforce the licensed patents and we may only do so if novadel fails to enforce such patents 
novadel is also the party who has the first right to defend third party infringement claims and who is in control of such proceedings  while we do not have clear contractual rights to defend such claims even if novadel fails to do so 
furthermore  if we become involved in any patent litigation  interference or other administrative proceedings  we will incur substantial expense and the efforts of our technical and management personnel will be significantly diverted 
as a result of such litigation or proceedings we could lose our proprietary position and be restricted or prevented from developing  manufacturing and selling the affected products  incur significant damage awards  including punitive damages  or be required to seek third party licenses that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain in part because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights  and we will not be able to ensure that we or our licensors or collaborators were the first to make the inventions described in patent applications  we or our licensors or collaborators were the first to file patent applications for inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights  any of our pending patent applications will result in issued patents  any patents licensed or issued to us will provide a basis for commercially viable products or will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  we will ultimately be able to enforce our owned or licensed patent rights pertaining to our products  any patents licensed or issued to us will not be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable or circumvented  we will develop or license proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
our success also depends upon the skills  knowledge and experience of our scientific and technical personnel  our consultants and advisors as well as our licensors and contractors 
to help protect our proprietary know how and our inventions for which patents may be unobtainable or difficult to obtain  we rely on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements 
to this end  we require all of our employees to enter into agreements which prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and  where applicable  require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas  developments  discoveries and inventions important to our business 
these agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of such information 
if any of our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information is disclosed  the value of our trade secrets  know how and other proprietary rights would be significantly impaired and our business and competitive position would suffer 
our license agreements relating to our product candidates may be terminated in the event we commit a material breach  the result of which would harm our business and future prospects 
our license agreements relating to talvesta and zensana are subject to termination by our licensors in the event we materially breach those agreements 
with respect to the talvesta license  dana farber cancer institute  inc and ash stevens  inc 
may terminate the agreement  after giving us notice and an opportunity to cure  if we commit a material breach  including failing to make a scheduled milestone or other payment when due  failing to meet our diligence obligations  ceasing to carry on our business with respect to the licensed products  or being convicted of a felony relating to the manufacture  use  sale or importation of the licensed products 
the agreement also provides that it may be terminated if we become involved in a bankruptcy  insolvency or similar proceeding 
under the zensana license  novadel may terminate our license  after giving us notice and an opportunity to cure  for our material breach or payment default 
the license also terminates automatically if we are involved in a bankruptcy 
our license agreement with albert einstein college of medicine  or aecom  similarly provides that aecom may terminate the agreement  after providing us with notice and an opportunity to cure  for our material breach or default  upon our bankruptcy 
in the event these license agreements are terminated  we will lose all of our rights to develop and commercialize the applicable product candidate covered by such license  which would harm our business and future prospects 
our license to marqibo  alocrest and sphingosome encapsulated topotecan are governed by a series of transaction agreements which may be individually or collectively terminated  not only by inex  but also by md anderson cancer center  british columbia cancer agency or university of british columbia under the underlying agreements governing the license or assignment of technology to inex 
inex may terminate these agreements for our uncured material breach  for our involvement in a bankruptcy  for our assertion or intention to assert any invalidity challenge on any of the patents licensed to us for these products or for our failure to meet our development or commercialization obligations  including the obligations of continuing to sell each product in all major market countries after its launch 
in the event that these agreements are terminated  not only will we lose all rights to these products  we will also have the obligation to transfer all of our data  materials  regulatory filings and all other documentation to our licensor  and our licensor may on its own exploit these products without any compensation to us  regardless of the progress or amount of investment we have made in the products 
third party claims of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend significant time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing our products 
in order to protect or enforce patent rights  we may initiate patent litigation against third parties 
similarly  we may be sued by others 
we also may become subject to proceedings conducted in the us patent and trademark office  including interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions  or reexamination proceedings 
in addition  any foreign patents that are granted may become subject to opposition  nullity  or revocation proceedings in foreign jurisdictions having such proceedings opposed by third parties in foreign jurisdictions having opposition proceedings 
the defense and prosecution  if necessary  of intellectual property actions are costly and divert technical and management personnel from their normal responsibilities 
no patent can protect its holder from a claim of infringement of another patent 
therefore  our patent position cannot and does not provide any assurance that the commercialization of our products would not infringe the patent rights of another 
while we know of no actual or threatened claim of infringement that would be material to us  there can be no assurance that such a claim will not be asserted 
if such a claim is asserted  there can be no assurance that the resolution of the claim would permit us to continue marketing the relevant product on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion 
if we do not successfully defend any infringement actions to which we become a party or are unable to have infringed patents declared invalid or unenforceable  we may have to pay substantial monetary damages  which can be tripled if the infringement is deemed willful  or be required to discontinue or significantly delay commercialization and development of the affected products 
we are aware of certain united states patents that relate to ondansetron compositions and uses therefor to treat nausea and vomiting 
these patents pertain to zofran  an fda approved first generation ht antagonist product 
we intend to base our nda for zensana  if any  under section b of the fdca  on one of these patents which is due to expire in september and is subject to a period of pediatric exclusivity expiring in march if and when it is commercialized  if zensana or its commercial use or production meets all of the requirements of any of the claims of the aforementioned patent or any other patents  or patents that may issue from related patent applications or any other patent applications  then we may need a license to one or more of these patents 
if any licenses are required  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such license on commercially favorable terms  if at all  and if these licenses are not obtained  we might be prevented from commercializing zensana 
any legal action against us or our collaborators claiming damages and seeking to enjoin developmental or marketing activities relating to affected products could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our collaborators to obtain licenses to continue to develop  manufacture or market the affected products 
such a license may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
an adverse determination in a proceeding involving our owned or licensed intellectual property may allow entry of generic substitutes for our products 
risks related to our securities our stock price has  and we expect it to continue to  fluctuate significantly  and the value of your investment may decline 
from january  to december   the market price of our common stock has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the volatile price of our stock makes it difficult for investors to predict the value of their investment  to sell shares at a profit at any given time  or to plan purchases and sales in advance 
you might not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the offering price due to fluctuations in the market price of the common stock arising from changes in our operating performance or prospects 
in addition  the stock markets in general  and the markets for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
a variety of factors may affect our operating performance and performance and cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 
these include  but are not limited to announcements by us or our competitors of regulatory developments  clinical trial results  clinical trial enrollment  regulatory filings  product development updates  new products and product launches  significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships or joint ventures  any intellectual property infringement  product liability or any other litigation involving us  developments or disputes concerning patents or other proprietary rights  regulatory developments in the united states and foreign countries  market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors and issuance of new or changed securities analysts reports or recommendations  economic or other crises and other external factors  actual or anticipated period to period fluctuations in our revenues and other results of operations  departure of any of our key management personnel  or sales of our common stock 
these and other factors may cause the market price and demand of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  which may limit investors from readily selling their shares of common stock and may otherwise negatively affect the liquidity or value of our common stock 
if our results do not meet analysts forecasts and expectations  our stock price could decline 
while research analysts and others have published forecasts as to the amount and timing of our future revenues and earnings  we have stated that we will not be providing any forecasts of the amount and timing of our future revenues and earnings until after two quarters of our sales and marketing efforts 
analysts who cover our business and operations provide valuations regarding our stock price and make recommendations whether to buy  hold or sell our stock 
our stock price may be dependent upon such valuations and recommendations 
analysts valuations and recommendations are based primarily on our reported results and their forecasts and expectations concerning our future results regarding  for example  expenses  revenues  clinical trials  regulatory marketing approvals and competition 
our future results are subject to substantial uncertainty  and we may fail to meet or exceed analysts forecasts and expectations as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed under the section risks related to our business 
if our results do not meet analysts forecasts and expectations  our stock price could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise 
we are at risk of securities class action litigation 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities 
this risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years 
if we faced such litigation  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our business 
because we do not expect to pay dividends  you will not realize any income from an investment in our common stock unless and until you sell your shares at profit 
we have never paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any dividends for the foreseeable future 
you should not rely on an investment in our stock if you require dividend income 
further  you will only realize income on an investment in our shares in the event you sell or otherwise dispose of your shares at a price higher than the price you paid for your shares 
such a gain would result only from an increase in the market price of our common stock  which is uncertain and unpredictable

overview we are a development stage based biopharmaceutical company focused on acquiring  developing  and commercializing innovative products to advance cancer care 
we seek to license novel  late preclinical and early clinical oncology product candidates  primarily from academia and research institutes  in order to accelerate clinical development and time to commercialization 
we currently have six product candidates in various stages of development marqibo vincristine sulfate liposomes injection a novel targeted anti cancer compound for non hodgkin s lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
we acquired our rights to marqibo from inex pharmaceuticals corporation in may marqibo has been evaluated in clinical trials with over patients  including phase ii clinical trials in patients with nhl and all 
based on the results from these studies  we plan to conduct a phase ii  open label trial in relapsed adult all 
we also plan to conduct a phase iii first line clinical trial in adults with all as a primary registrational trial 
this phase iii randomized  multicenter trial will compare marqibo to vincristine in the induction  consolidation  and maintenance phases of treatment in elderly patients with all we plan to conduct this study in collaboration with three major oncology cooperative groups 
pending finalization of the protocol by the cooperative groups  we plan to initiate this study in in addition  we anticipate pursuing a randomized pivotal trial in front line non hodgkin s lymphoma  where marqibo has previously demonstrated positive indications of clinical benefit 
talvesta talotrexin for injection a novel antifolate for solid and hematological malignancies 
talvesta is a novel antifolate product candidate under development for treatment of various types of tumors 
in april  we commenced an nci sponsored phase i clinical trial to evaluate the safety of talvesta when administering it intravenously on days  and of a day cycle to patients with solid tumors 
in march  this clinical trial was discontinued due to toxicity 
subjects received doses of talvesta with one patient death being reported during this clinical trial 
we are currently conducting a phase i ii clinical trial in non small cell lung cancer 
in the phase i portion of this clinical trial  which is now closed for enrollment  multiple infusions of talvesta were administered to patients to ascertain the maximum tolerated doses of the drug 
the aim of the phase ii portion of the clinical trial is primarily to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival of the patients 
we have suspended enrollment in the phase ii portion of this clinical trial for additional safety analysis 
in may  we commenced a phase i ii clinical trial in all 
phase i of this clinical trial is closed for enrollment 
based on the observations from the phase i solid tumor trial  we have decided to conduct additional toxicology studies 
while we have not seen issues related to toxicity in the all trial  we have proactively suspended enrollment in the phase ii all trial as a safety precaution 
we will also postpone the initiation of new clinical trials with talvesta until these additional toxicology studies have been reviewed at this time  we anticipate the toxicology studies to be completed in the fourth quarter of based on the data from the toxicology studies  the final safety and efficacy analysis of the completed trials we expect to launch additional trials in solid and hematological malignancies in late net income in includes employee stock based compensation costs of million  due to our adoption of fas r on a modified prospective basis on january  prior to  the company had previously only recognized employee stock based compensation expense using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb alocrest vinorelbine tartrate liposomes injection a novel targeted anti cancer compound for breast and lung cancer 
in august  we initiated a phase i clinical trial to assess the safety  tolerability and preliminary efficacy of alocrest in patients with advanced solid tumors  including non small cell lung and breast cancers 
the trial is being conducted at the cancer therapy and research center in san antonio  texas and at mcgill university in montreal 
sphingosome encapsulated topotecan a novel targeted anti cancer compound for small cell lung cancer and ovarian cancer 
following completion of preclinical development  we expect to file an investigational new drug application  or ind  and to initiate clinical trials in zensana ondansetron hci oral spray bioequivalent to mg oral zofran tablet with multidose convenience and desirable route of administration 
in june  we submitted our nda for zensana for the prevention of cinv  rinv and ponv under section b of the fdca  a form of registration that relies  at least in part  on data in previously approved ndas or published literature for which we do not have a right of reference or both 
while our nda was pending with the fda  long term stability studies revealed small amounts of precipitated material in scale up batches of zensana 
through further investigation of this issue  we confirmed it has now been determined that the precipitation issue recently reported by hana in long term stability was not related to the manufacturing process  but is in fact an issue with the original formulation 
as a result  in march  we withdrew our nda without prejudice 
we have stopped further investigation of the original formulation 
our partner and licensor  novadel  has developed an alternate formulation of the product 
the alternate formulation is currently under active investigation and scale up 
if this alternative formulation is stable  we will then need to reestablish bioequivalency through new clinical trials 
if these studies are successful  we anticipate being in a position to file an nda sometime in  at the earliest 
menadione a topical compound for skin rashes associated with egfr inhibitors 
we acquired the rights to menadione in october pursuant to a license agreement with the albert einstein school of medicine 
we expect to complete formulation of menadione by the end of and to file an ind in to date  we have not received approval for the sale of any drug candidates in any market and  therefore  have not generated any revenues from our drug candidates 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
product development costs and timelines can vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to accurately predict 
various laws and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially  adversely affect our business 
we are a development stage company and have no product sales to date and we will not receive any product sales until we receive approval from the fda or equivalent foreign regulatory bodies to begin selling our pharmaceutical candidates 
developing pharmaceutical products  however  is a lengthy and very expensive process 
in addition  as we continue the development of our remaining product pipeline  our research and development expenses will further increase 
to the extent we are successful in acquiring additional product candidates for our development pipeline  our need to finance further research and development will continue increasing 
accordingly  our success depends not only on the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  but also on our ability to finance the development of these product candidates 
our major sources of working capital have been proceeds from various private financings  primarily private sales of our common stock and other equity securities 
since our inception in december  we have completed five financings resulting in total gross proceeds of million  before selling commissions and related offering expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for laboratory development  legal expenses resulting from intellectual property protection  business development and organizational affairs and other expenses relating to the acquiring  design  development  testing  and enhancement of our product candidates  including milestone payments for licensed technology 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and other administrative personnel  recruitment expenses  professional fees and other corporate expenses  including accounting and general legal activities 
our results for the year ended december  include share based compensation for awards that were granted to employees and nonemployees from september to may   but were not measured for accounting purposes until these awards were approved by shareholders on may   in accordance with sfas r 
we are taking the entire expense in for the share based compensation that would have been expensed in had the share based awards been approved at the time of original issuance 
critical accounting policies the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe there are certain accounting policies that are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  as these policies affect the reported amounts of expenses and involve management s judgment regarding significant estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies and their application in the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures with our audit committee of the board of directors 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r requiring that compensation cost relating to all share based employee payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements 
the cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award using the black scholes merton option pricing model  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method for share based awards granted after we became a public entity and the prospective method for share based awards granted prior to the time we became a public entity and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for prior periods presented in this form q have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of recognizing compensation cost relating to stock options 
in applying the modified prospective transition method of sfas no 
r  we estimated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
as allowed by sfas no 
r for companies with a short period of publicly traded stock history  our estimate of expected volatility is based on the average expected volatilities of a sampling of five companies with similar attributes to us  including industry  stage of life cycle  size and financial leverage 
as we have so far only awarded plain vanilla options as described by the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 we used the simplified method for determining the expected life of the options granted 
this method is allowed until december   after which we will be required to adopt another method to determine expected life of the option awards in the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant valuation 
sfas no 
r does not allow companies to account for option forfeitures as they occur 
instead  estimated option forfeitures must be calculated upfront to reduce the option expense to be recognized over the life of the award and updated upon the receipt of further information as to the amount of options expected to be forfeited 
based on our historical information  we currently estimate that annually of our stock options awarded will be forfeited 
for options granted while we were a nonpublic entity  we applied the prospective method in which the awards that were valued under the minimum value method for pro forma disclosure purposes will continue to be expensed using the intrinsic value method of apb prior to january   we accounted for option grants to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
 and related interpretations 
the company also followed the disclosure requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the guidelines of apb no 
 we were only required to record a charge for grants of options to employees if on the date of grant they had an intrinsic value which was calculated based on the excess  if any  of the market value of the common stock underlying the option over the exercise price 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes merton option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes merton and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements contained in response to item of this annual report for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
licensed in process research and development licensed in process research and development relates primarily to technology  intellectual property and know how acquired from another entity 
we evaluate the stage of development as well as additional time  resources and risks related to development and eventual commercialization of the acquired technology 
as we historically have acquired non fda approved technologies  the nature of the remaining efforts for completion and commercialization generally include completion of clinical trials  completion of manufacturing validation  interpretation of clinical and preclinical data and obtaining marketing approval from the fda and other regulatory bodies 
the cost in resources  probability of success and length of time to commercialization are extremely difficult to determine 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist with respect to the timely completion of development projects  including clinical trial results  manufacturing process development results and ongoing feedback from regulatory authorities  including obtaining marketing approval 
additionally  there is no guarantee that the acquired technology will ever be successfully commercialized due to the uncertainties associated with the pricing of new pharmaceuticals  the cost of sales to produce these products in a commercial setting  changes in the reimbursement environment or the introduction of new competitive products 
due to the risks and uncertainties noted above  we will expense such licensed in process research and development projects when incurred 
however  the cost of acquisition of technology is capitalized if there are alternative future uses in other research and development projects or otherwise based on internal review 
all milestone payments will be expensed in the period the milestone is reached 
clinical study activities and other expenses from third party contract research organizations all of our research and development activities related to clinical study activity are conducted by various third parties  including contract research organizations  which may also provide contractually defined administration and management services 
expense incurred for these contracted activities are based upon a variety of factors  including actual and estimated patient enrollment rates  clinical site initiation activities  labor hours and other activity based factors 
on a regular basis  our estimates of these costs are reconciled to actual invoices from the service providers  and adjustments are made accordingly 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation defines the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
on september   fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this statement references fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
the statement applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the statement does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
it is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the sec s staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
this bulletin provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the guidance in this bulletin must be applied to financial reports covering the first fiscal year ending after november  there was no impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows upon the adoption of the provisions of sab on february   fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas the statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies using different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  earlier adoption is permitted provided the company also elects to apply the provisions of sfas  fair value measurement 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that this standard may have on our financial statements 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative  or g a  expense was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is due primarily to an increase in salaries  other employee benefits and personnel related costs of approximately million  including an increase of million in employee related share based compensation expense due to the implementation of sfas no 
r in accounting for employee stock options as well as increased salary and benefits of  due to increased headcount in compared to for the year ended december   we also incurred an increase of approximately million in associated professional fees and outside services  mainly due to an increase of  in share based compensation for consultants and an increase of approximately million in legal  accounting and consulting fees 
increase in accounting and legal fees is primarily due to increased expenses for public filings and compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
also for the year ended december   there was an increase of approximately million in allocable expenses  including a decrease of  in rent  insurance  depreciation and other overhead expenses  and an increase of  in travel and seminar costs  and an increase of  in sales and marketing expense in preparation for previously planned launch of zensana 
research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   research and development  or r d  expense was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is due primarily to an increase of million in expenses for the clinical development of our product pipeline  including million in license fees and transaction services related to the inex  zensana  menadione and talvesta license agreements 
also included in the clinical costs is an increase of million in clinical expense related to our zensana  ipdr and talvesta development programs  a large majority is related to the manufacturing scale up costs for zensana 
our clinical costs increased by million for research and development costs related to the development costs of our three drug candidates licensed from inex in may these clinical costs included the physical manufacturing of drug compounds  payments to our contract research organizations 
we had increased legal expenses associated with our continued patent protection and other professional fees and services  which increased approximately million 
for the year ended december   we incurred increased salary  employee benefits and other r d personnel related costs of approximately million as compared to the year ended dec 
  including an increase of million in employee related stock based compensation expense  and an increase of million in salary  bonus and other benefit expenses due to increased headcount 
other allocable operating expenses increased by approximately  for the year ended dec 
 compared to the year ended dec 
 this includes a  increase in travel and conference expenses  and a  increase in rent  insurance and other overhead costs as head count increased in over interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   net interest income was million as compared to net interest income of  for the year ended december  the increase of million resulted from increased cash balance in our interest bearing accounts due to our may financing which resulted in net proceeds of million  plus rising interest rates 
income tax expense there was no current or deferred income tax expense other than state minimum tax for the years ended december  and because of the company s operating losses 
a valuation allowance has been recorded against our million of deferred tax assets as of december  historical performance leads management to believe that realization of these assets is uncertain 
as a result of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   g a expense was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to an increase in salaries and other employee benefits of approximately  which resulted from us realizing full year salary expense of four full time employees at december  for the year ended december   we also incurred an increase of approximately  associated with professional fees and insurance 
this increase is mostly attributed to higher accounting expenses as well as an increase in director and officer insurance when compared to the corresponding period of the previous year 
in addition  we incurred an increase in expenses of approximately  relating to the listing of our securities on the american stock exchange 
for the year ended december   our stock based compensation expense included in g a for options issued to employees increased by approximately  another contributing factor to the additional overall expense was an increase of approximately  in stock based expense relating to common stock earned by our investor relations firm 
these increased expenses for the year ended december  were partially offset by a decrease in expenses of approximately  relating to the fair value of options granted to non employees for services rendered 
research and development expenses 
for the year ended december   r d expense was million  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is due primarily to an increase in the physical manufacturing of drug compounds  payments to our contract research organization  and legal expenses associated with our continued patent protection of approximately million 
another contributing factor to the additional overall expense was an increase in salaries and other employee benefits of approximately  which resulted from increasing our full time employees from six at december   to ten full time employees devoted to r d at december  for the year ended december   our stock based compensation expense included in r d for options issued to employees increased by approximately  in addition  for the year ended december   we experienced a decrease of approximately  relating to the fair value of option grants to non employees for services rendered 
another decrease for the year ended december  was attributable to two expenses relating to our october license agreement with novadel pharma 
as a result of that license agreement  we recognized an expense of  for the year ended december  related to the issuance of common stock to novadel in partial consideration for the license agreement 
in addition  pursuant to the terms of the novadel license agreement  in exchange for million  we purchased  shares of the novadel s common stock at a per share price of  a premium of per share or  over the then market value of our common stock  which was expensed as part of the license fee in the year ended december  for the year ended december   we also recognized an increase of  relating to milestones achieved as part of our on going clinical progression 
other increases for the year ended december   when compared to the previous year  is an increase in travel expense of approximately  interest income expense  net 
for the year ended december   net interest income was  as compared to net interest income of  for the year ended december  the increase of  resulted from our increased cash balance deposited in interest earning money market accounts as well as our repayment of all notes payable during the latter half of resulting in lower interest expense in liquidity and capital resources from inception to december   we have incurred an aggregate net loss of million  primarily as a result of expenses incurred through a combination of research and development activities related to the various technologies under our control and expenses supporting those activities 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through equity financing 
from inception through december   we had a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million 
this increase primarily resulted from net cash provided by financing activities of million  substantially all of which was derived from our five private placements which netted proceeds of million 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was offset by net cash used in operating activities of million and net cash used in investing activities of million for the cumulative period from inception to december  our continued operations will depend on whether we are able to raise additional funds through various potential sources  such as equity and debt financing 
through december   a significant portion of our financing has been through private placements of common stock  preferred stock and debt financing 
we will continue to fund operations from cash on hand and through future placements of capital stock or debt financings 
we can give no assurances that any additional capital that we are able to obtain will be sufficient to meet our needs 
given the current and desired pace of clinical development of our six product candidates  we estimate that we will have sufficient cash on hand to fund clinical development through and into we may  however  choose to raise additional capital before in order to fund our future development activities  likely by selling shares of our capital stock or other securities 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will likely be forced to curtail our desired development activities  which will delay the development of our product candidates 
there can be no assurance that such capital will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
we will need additional financing thereafter until we can achieve profitability  if ever 
financings 
in february  we received gross proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with this offering  we paid commissions and other offering related expenses consisting of  in cash and issued a year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock to paramount biocapital  inc  which served as placement agent  for its services rendered 
in july  we received gross proceeds of million through the sale of  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock  all of which converted into  shares of common shares in january in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
in connection with the private placement  we issued to the investors and placement agents five year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  of which warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares remain outstanding 
the terms of the warrants provide that we may  at our option  redeem the warrants after such time that the average closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a day period  which condition was satisfied in august accordingly  we may  at our election  redeem the warrants  at a redemption price of per warrant share  at any time upon days prior written notice to the warrant holders 
the warrants remain exercisable by the holders until the expiration of such day notice period 
in connection with the private placement  we paid an aggregate of approximately  in commissions to placement agents 
included in the amounts paid to placement agents were  in commissions and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to paramount biocapital  inc  a related party 
we also incurred approximately  of legal expenses for the private placement 
in october  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock 
of the total number of shares sold   shares were sold at a price of per share and  shares were sold to executive officers and affiliates of a director of our company at a price of per share  which resulted in total gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
in addition to the shares of common stock  the investors also received year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares at an exercise price of per share 
in connection with the private placement  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in commissions to placement agents and issued year warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares at an exercise price of per share 
we also incurred approximately  of legal and other expenses paid to placement agents 
in may  we completed a registered direct placement of  shares of our common stock 
of the total number of shares sold   shares were sold at a price of per share and  shares were sold to executive officers and affiliates of one of our directors at a price of per share  which resulted in total gross proceeds to us of approximately million 
in connection with the purchase agreement  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in commissions to placement agents 
we also incurred approximately  of legal and other expenses paid to placement agents current and future financing needs 
our plan of operation for the year ending december  is to continue implementing our business strategy  including the continued development of our six product candidates that are currently in clinical and preclinical phases 
we also intend to expand our drug candidate portfolio by acquiring additional drug technologies for development 
we expect our principal expenditures during the next months to include operating expenses  including expanded research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses  product development expenses  including the costs incurred with respect to applications to conduct clinical trials in the united states  as well as outside of the united states  for our six product candidates  including manufacturing  intellectual property prosecution and regulatory compliance 
as part of our planned expansion  we intend to use clinical research organizations and third parties to perform our clinical studies and manufacturing 
as indicated above  at our current and desired pace of clinical development of our six product candidates  over the next months we expect to spend approximately million on clinical development including milestone payments of million that we expect to be triggered under the license agreements relating to our product candidates  million on marketing  general corporate and administrative expenses  and  on facilities and rent 
we plan to initiate a phase ii  open label trial in relapsed adult all 
we also plan to conduct a phase iii registrational clinical trial for marqibo in front line all 
we also expect to complete our phase i clinical trial and initiate a phase ii clinical trial for alocrest in solid tumors 
we expect to initiate a phase i study in sphingosome encapsulated topotecan we also plan to complete formulation and preclinical work on menadione  and anticipate filing an ind in we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which totaled million as of december   will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs through and into based upon current operating and spending assumptions 
however  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue our drug discovery and development efforts  particularly to the extent we advance our lead candidate marqibo into and through a pivotal clinical study 
we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
however  the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the following costs associated with conducting preclinical and clinical testing  costs associated with commercializing our lead programs  including establishing sales and marketing functions  costs of establishing arrangements for manufacturing our product candidates  costs of acquiring new drug candidates  payments required under our current and any future license agreements and collaborations  costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  costs of obtaining  maintaining and defending patents on our product candidates  and costs of increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have based our estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
we may need to obtain additional funds sooner or in greater amounts than we currently anticipate 
potential sources of financing include strategic relationships  public or private sales of our stock or debt and other sources 
we may seek to access the public or private equity markets when conditions are favorable due to our long term capital requirements 
we do not have any committed sources of financing at this time  and it is uncertain whether additional funding will be available when we need it on terms that will be acceptable to us  or at all 
if we raise funds by selling additional shares of common stock or other securities convertible into common stock  the ownership interest of our existing stockholders will be diluted 
if we are not able to obtain financing when needed  we may be unable to carry out our business plan 
as a result  we may have to significantly limit our operations and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially harmed 
research and development projects the discussion below describes for each of our development projects the research and development expenses we have incurred to date and  to the extent we are able to reasonably ascertain  the amounts we estimate we will have to expend in order to complete development of each project and the time we estimate it will take to complete development of each project 
in addition to those identified under item a of this annual report  our assumptions relating the expected costs of development and timeframe for completion are dependent on numerous factors  including the availability of capital  unforeseen safety issues  lack of effectiveness  and significant unforeseen delays in the clinical trial and regulatory approval process  any of which could be extremely costly 
in addition  our estimates assume that we will be able to enroll a sufficient number of patients in clinical trials 
since our business does not currently generate any cash flow  however  we may need to raise additional capital to continue development of our product candidates beyond if we are to raise such capital  we expect to raise it primarily by selling shares of our capital stock 
to the extent additional capital is not available when we need it  we may be forced to discontinue or scale back our development efforts relating to one or more of our product candidates our out license our rights to our product candidates to a third party  any of which would have a material adverse effect on the prospects of our business 
marqibo 
since acquiring the exclusive world wide rights to develop and commercialize marqibo in may  we have incurred million in project costs related to our development of marqibo through december  we plan to initiate a phase ii  open label trial in relapsed adult all in we also plan to conduct a phase iii registrational trial in front line all in we estimate that we will need to expend at least an aggregate of approximately million in order for us to obtain fda approval for marqibo  if ever  which amount includes a milestone payment that would be owed to our licensor upon fda approval 
we believe we currently have sufficient capital to fund our planned development activities of marqibo through we expect that it will take approximately three to four years until we will have completed development and obtained fda approval of marqibo  if ever 
talvesta 
from inception through december   we have incurred million of costs related to our development of talvesta  of which million  million and million was incurred in fiscal  and  respectively 
we believe we currently have sufficient capital to fund our planned development activities of talvesta through we estimate that we will need to expend an aggregate of approximately million in order to complete development of talvesta  should we opt to continue development 
costs incurred are a direct result of ensuring proper study conduct in accordance with local regulations 
should we choose to continue development  we expect that it will take an additional four to five years before we complete development and obtain fda approval of talvesta  if ever

we estimate that we will need to expend at least an aggregate of approximately million  in order for us to obtain fda approval for alocrest  if ever  which amount includes milestone payments that would be owed to our licensor upon fda approval 
we believe we currently have sufficient capital to fund our planned development activities of alocrest through we expect that it will take approximately five to six years until we will have completed development and obtained fda approval of alocrest  if ever 
sphingosome encapsulated topotecan 
along with our rights to marqibo  we acquired our rights to develop and commercialize sphingosome encapsulated topotecan in may in connection with our license transaction with inex pharmaceuticals corporation 
since acquiring the exclusive world wide rights to develop and commercialize sphingosome encapsulated topotecan in may  we have incurred million in project costs related to our development of this drug through december  following completion of additional preclinical development  we expect to file an ind and initiate clinical trials in as this drug is early in its clinical development  both the registrational strategy and total expenditures to obtain fda approval are still being evaluated

since acquiring our rights to zensana in october  we have incurred million of project costs related to our development through december   of which million was incurred in the year ended december  and million was incurred in fiscal in june  we submitted our nda for zensana for the prevention of cinv  rinv and ponv under section b of the fdca 
while our nda was pending with the fda  long term stability studies revealed small amounts of precipitated material in scale up batches of zensana 
through further investigation of this issue  we have determined that the precipitation issue in long term stability was not related to the manufacturing process  but is in fact an issue with the original formulation 
as a result  in march  we withdrew our nda previously submitted to the fda 
our partner and licensor  novadel  has developed an alternate formulation of the product 
the alternate formulation is currently under active investigation and scale up 
if this alternative formulation is stable  we will then need to reestablish bioequivalency through new clinical trials 
if these studies are successful  we anticipate being in a position to file an nda sometime in  at the earliest if we are able to use this alternative formulation for zensana  we estimate that we will need to expend at least an additional million before we receive fda approval for zensana  if ever  which amount includes a milestone payment that would be owed to our licensor upon fda approval 
menadione 
we licensed our rights to menadione from the albert einstein college of medicine in october and have incurred approximately  in project costs related to our development of this drug through december  we expect to complete formulation of menadione by the first half of and to file an ind by the end of we will incur approximately million in costs to fund our research and development efforts for this drug during as this drug is early in its clinical development  both the registrational strategy and total expenditures to obtain fda approval are still being evaluated 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet agreements  as that term is defined by sec regulation
