item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview basis of presentation the accompanying financial data has been prepared by us pursuant to the rules and regulations of the us securities and exchange commission sec 
for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the combined and consolidated financial statements and related notes presented in this report on form k 
our fiscal year end is october  and our fiscal quarters end on january  april  and july unless otherwise stated  all dates refer to our fiscal years and fiscal periods 
amounts included in the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements are expressed in us dollars 
prior to june   we had operated as part of agilent  and not as a stand alone company 
therefore  the accompanying combined and consolidated financial statements prior to june   were derived from the accounting records of agilent using the historical basis of assets and liabilities of verigy 
the expense and cost allocations prior to june   have been determined on a basis we consider to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided by agilent or the benefit received by us from agilent 
agilent historically used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations 
transactions relating to verigy prior to june  were accounted for through the agilent invested equity account for verigy 
accordingly  none of the cash  cash equivalents or debt at the agilent corporate level has been assigned to verigy in the combined and consolidated financial statements prior to june  business summary we design  develop  manufacture and sell advanced test systems and solutions for the semiconductor industry 
as part of our single scalable platform strategy  we develop and offer performance and capability enhancements to our platforms as part of our product development roadmap 
we offer a single platform for each of the two general categories of devices being tested our series platform  designed to test socs  sips and high speed memory devices  and our versatest v series platform  designed to test memory devices  including flash memory and multi chip packages 
we also provide a range of services that assist our customers in quickly and cost effectively delivering the innovative  feature rich products demanded by their end users 
more than a decade ago  we introduced the concept of scalable platform architecture for semiconductor testing  and we are continuing to capitalize on the benefits of that strategy today 
our scalable platform architecture provides us with internal operating model efficiencies such as reduced research and development costs  engineering headcount  support requirements and inventory risk 
we sell our products and services directly to a wide range of customers  including integrated device manufacturers  or idms  test subcontractors  which includes specialty assembly  package and test companies as well as wafer foundries  and fabless design companies 
we have a broad installed customer base  having sold over  of our series systems and over  of our versatest series systems 
overview of results in fiscal year  two customers  chipmos technologies bermuda ltd 
and spansion inc  accounted for more than of our net revenue 
in fiscal year  one customer  chipmos technologies bermuda ltd  accounted for more than of our net revenue 
in fiscal year  no single customer accounted for more than of our net revenue 
we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside north america 
net revenue from customers located outside of north america represented  and of total net revenue in fiscal years   and  respectively 
net revenue in north america was lower by in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  due to the continuing outsourcing by our north american customers to contract manufacturers in asia 
net revenue in asia including japan was higher by in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year we expect this trend of increasing sales in asia including japan to continue as semiconductor manufacturing activities continue to concentrate in that region 
the sales of our products and services are dependent  to a large degree  on customers who are subject to cyclical trends in the demand for their products 
these cyclical periods have had and will have significant impacts on our business since our customers often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to changes in their businesses and to demand fluctuations in the semiconductor industry 
historically  these demand fluctuations have resulted in significant variations in our results of operations 
upturns and downturns in the semiconductor industry in recent years have generally affected the semiconductor test equipment and services industry more significantly than the overall capital equipment sector 
furthermore  we sell to a variety of customers  including subcontractors 
because we sell to subcontractors  which during market downturns tend to reduce or cancel orders for new test systems and test services more quickly and dramatically than other customers  any downturn may cause a quicker and more significant adverse impact on our business than on the broader semiconductor industry 
in addition  although a decline in orders for semiconductor capital equipment may accompany or precede the timing of a decline in the semiconductor market as a whole  recovery in semiconductor capital equipment spending may lag the recovery by the semiconductor industry 
in connection with our separation from agilent in june  we transitioned the manufacturing processes for the series products that we previously conducted internally to flextronics telecom services ltd 
flextronics 
as a result of this transition  we now rely entirely on contract manufacturers 
flextronics commenced production of our versatest series products in china in july and assumed our manufacturing activities for the series products in germany in june our volume manufacturing activities related to our series platform will ultimately transition to flextronics in china 
however  given the recent increased demand for our soc products  coupled with our customers tight delivery schedule requirements  we have decided to maintain additional manufacturing capacity at flextronics in germany 
we expect this manufacturing model to improve our ability to manage costs in a cyclical market  drive down inventory costs and exposure  improve our responsiveness to customer demand and place us closer to emerging markets 
we believe that relying upon independent contract manufacturers will decrease our fixed costs and better position us to respond to changes in the demand for our products 
with our selection of flextronics as our primary independent manufacturing supplier  we are leveraging their worldwide processes  tools and infrastructure and are expanding our manufacturing in asia  where flextronics already has a significant capability for manufacturing complex technologies 
as a result of this outsourcing arrangement  we expect to lower our fixed costs by reducing our capital investments and manufacturing equipment and by reducing the size of our manufacturing work force located in high cost geographies 
in addition  although we will continue to retain some key strategic procurement activities  we expect to reduce our material costs by leveraging flextronics tactical supply chain expertise and securing local suppliers 
as a result of these actions  we expect to have improved gross margins and reduced inventory when compared to historical levels 
our third and fourth fiscal quarters tend to be our strongest quarters for new orders  while our first fiscal quarter tends to be our weakest quarter for orders 
we believe that the most significant factor driving these seasonal patterns is the holiday buying season for consumer electronics products 
the seasonality of our business is often masked to a significant extent  however  by the high degree of cyclicality of the semiconductor industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our combined and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and of actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results may be different from the estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
those policies include revenue recognition  restructuring charges  inventory valuation  warranty  share based compensation  retirement and post retirement plan assumptions  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and accounting for income taxes 
revenue recognition 
net revenue is derived from the sale of products and services and is adjusted for returns and allowances  which historically have been insignificant 
consistent with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  we recognize revenue on the sale of semiconductor test equipment when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery is considered to have occurred when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  for products  or when service has been performed 
we consider the price to be fixed or determinable when the price is not subject to refund or adjustments 
at the time we take an order  we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers to determine the appropriate timing of revenue recognition 
for sales or arrangements that include customer specified acceptance criteria  including those where acceptance is required upon achievement of performance milestones or fulfillment of other future obligations  revenue is recognized after the acceptance criteria have been met 
if the criteria are not met  then revenue is deferred until such criteria are met or until the period s over which the last undelivered element is delivered 
to the extent that a contingent payment exceeds the fair value of the undelivered element  we defer the contingent payment 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of various types of test equipment 
software is embedded in many of our test equipment products  but the software component is considered to be incidental 
for revenue arrangements that include multiple elements  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf for products that include installation  if we have previously successfully installed similar equipment  product revenue is recognized upon delivery  and recognition of installation revenue is delayed until the installation is complete 
otherwise  neither the product nor the installation revenue is recognized until the installation is complete 
revenue from services includes extended warranty  customer support  consulting  training  and education services 
service revenue is deferred and recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered to the customer 
for example  customer support contracts are recognized ratably over the contractual period  while training revenue is recognized as the training is provided to the customer 
in addition  all of the revenue recognition criteria described above must be met before service revenue is recognized 
we use objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to elements in multiple element arrangements and recognize revenue when the criteria for revenue recognition have been met for each element 
in the absence of objective evidence of fair value of a delivered element  we allocate revenue to the fair value of the undelivered elements and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
the price charged when an element is sold separately generally determines fair value 
restructuring charges 
we recognize a liability for restructuring costs at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the three main components of our restructuring charges are workforce reductions  consolidating facilities and asset impairments 
workforce related charges are accrued when it is determined that a liability has been incurred  which is generally when individuals have been notified of their termination dates and expected severance payments 
plans to eliminate excess facilities result in charges for lease termination fees and future commitments to pay lease charges  net of estimated future sublease income 
we recognize charges for elimination of excess facilities when we have vacated the premises 
asset impairments primarily consist of property  plant and equipment associated with excess facilities being eliminated  and are based on an estimate of the amounts and timing of future cash flows related to the expected future remaining use and ultimate sale or disposal of the property  plant and equipment 
the charges associated with consolidating facilities and asset impairment charges incurred by agilent prior to our separation were allocated to verigy to the extent the underlying benefits related to our business 
these estimates were derived using the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 staff accounting bulletin  restructuring and impairment charges sab  emerging issues task force  liability recognition for costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and lastly  sfas no 
accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas no 
which was effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  if the amounts and timing of cash flows from restructuring activities are significantly different from what we have estimated  the actual amount of restructuring and asset impairment charges could be materially different  either higher or lower  than those we have recorded 
inventory valuation 
we assess the valuation of our inventory  including demonstration inventory  on a quarterly basis based upon estimates about future demand and actual usage 
to the extent that we determine that we are holding excess or obsolete inventory  we write down the value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
such write downs are reflected in cost of products and can be material in amount 
we recorded net inventory charges of million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our inventory assessment involves difficult estimates of future events and  as a result  additional write downs may be required 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold to customers  resulting in lower cost of products and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
excess and obsolete inventory resulting from shifts in demand or changes in market conditions for raw materials and components can result in significant volatility in our costs of products 
in our inventory valuation analysis  we also include inventory that we could be obligated to purchase from our suppliers based on our production forecasts 
to the extent that our committed inventory purchases exceed our forecasted productions needs  we write down the value of those inventories by taking a charge to our cost of products and increasing our supplier liability 
warranty 
we generally provide a one year warranty on products commencing upon installation or delivery 
we accrue for warranty costs in accordance with statement of financial standards no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas no 
 based on historical trends in warranty charges as a percent of gross product shipments 
estimated warranty charges are recorded within cost of products at the time revenue is recognized and the liability is reported in other current liabilities on the combined balance sheet 
the accrual is reviewed regularly and periodically adjusted to reflect changes in warranty cost estimates 
for some products we also offer extended warranties beyond one year 
costs associated with our extended warranty contracts beyond one year are expensed as incurred 
separation costs 
separation costs are one time internal and external spin off related costs  such as information technology set up costs and consulting and legal and other professional fees 
we do not expect any significant separation costs after october  share based compensation 
we account for share based awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  shared based payment sfas no 
r which was effective november  for verigy 
under this standard  share based compensation expense is primarily based on estimated grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized on a straight line basis for awards granted after november  over the vesting period of the award 
for awards issued prior to november   we recognize share based compensation expense based on fasb interpretation accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans an interpretation of apb opinions no 
and  which provides for accelerated expensing 
our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns expected life of the options  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made are reasonable and appropriate  changes in assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
we incurred million and million in share based compensation expense during fiscal and we did not incur any share based compensation expense in also see note share based compensation of the combined and consolidated financial statements 
retirement and post retirement plan assumptions 
retirement and post retirement benefit plan costs are a significant cost of doing business 
they represent obligations that will ultimately be settled sometime in the future and therefore are subject to estimation 
pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees average expected future service based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by us 
to estimate the impact of these future payments and our decisions concerning funding of these obligations  we are required to make assumptions using actuarial concepts within the framework of us gaap 
two critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long term return on plan assets 
other important assumptions include the health care cost trend rate  expected future salary increases  expected future increases to benefit payments  expected retirement dates  employee turnover and retiree mortality rates 
we evaluate these assumptions at least annually 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit payments at each measurement date october for us plans and september for non us plans 
the discount rate for non us plans was determined based on published rates for high quality corporate bonds 
the discount rate for non us plans was generally determined in a similar manner 
differences between the expected future cash flows of our plans and the maturities of the high quality corporate bonds are not expected to have a material impact on the selection of discount rates 
as discount rates decrease  we would expect our net plan costs to increase and as discount rates increase we would expect our net plan costs to decrease 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 became effective for us as of october  and requires recognition of an asset or liability in the statement of financial position reflecting the funded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans such as retiree health and life  with current year changes recognized in shareholders equity 
at october   in order to recognize the funded status of its pension and post retirement benefit plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recorded additional liabilities by a cumulative amount of million of which million net of tax of million was recorded as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
these losses are being recognized over the expected average future service lives of plan participants 
also see note retirement plans and post retirement benefits 
the expected long term return on plan assets is estimated using current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns 
declining rate of return assumptions generally result in increased pension expense while increasing rate of return assumptions generally result in lower pension expense 
a one percent change in the estimated long term return on our pension plan assets would result in a million impact on pension expense for our fiscal year there are no plan assets related to our post retirement health care plans 
workforce related events such as restructurings or divestitures can result in curtailment and settlement gains or losses to the extent they have an impact on the average future working lifetime or total number of participants in our retirement and postretirement plans 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of based on our estimates of forecasted discounted cash flows  we concluded that we did not have any impairment at that time 
our accounting for goodwill and purchased intangible assets complies with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time that impairment indicators arise 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include but are not limited to significant decrease in market price of an asset  significant adverse changes in the extent or use or physical condition of an asset  significant adverse change in legal or regulatory factors affecting an asset  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  accumulation of costs significantly in excess of expected costs to acquire or construct an asset  operating or cash flow losses or projections of losses that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset  or a current expectation that more likely than not  an asset will be sold or disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed using the straight line method over the economic lives of the respective assets  generally three to five years 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
we estimate expected future cash flows then compare the carrying value including goodwill and other intangibles to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
accounting for income taxes 
we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized 
we are required to assess the realization of our net deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance 
this assessment requires that our management make judgments about benefits that could be realized from future taxable income  as well as other positive and negative factors influencing the realization of deferred tax assets 
we had no valuation allowance against any net deferred tax assets as of october  and prior to our separation  we maintained a full valuation allowance for losses we incurred in the us and japan  prior to fiscal year undistributed earnings of our domestic us and foreign subsidiaries are indefinitely reinvested in the respective operations 
no provision has been made for taxes that might be payable upon remittance of such earnings  nor is it practicable to determine the amount of this liability 
our effective tax rate varies based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  restructuring and other one time charges  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
we are subject to audits and examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the internal revenue service 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes

net revenue is derived from the sale of products and services and is adjusted for returns and allowances  which historically have been insignificant 
our product revenue is generated predominantly from the sales of our test equipment products 
revenue from services includes extended warranty  customer support  consulting  training and education activities 
service revenue is recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered to the customer 
net revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from the million achieved in fiscal year net product revenue for fiscal year was million  a decrease of million  or  from million achieved in fiscal year the decrease in product revenue was primarily due to lower sales volume of our soc sip test systems  partially offset by higher revenue from sales of our memory test systems  spurred by continued strong demand for hand held consumer products as well as the expansion of the markets that we serve into nand flash and flash final test 
net product revenue from sales of our soc sip high speed memory test systems decreased by million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to weakness in demand for our soc sip high speed memory test systems during the first half of fiscal year  particularly from sub contractors 
during the second half of fiscal year  however  we did experience an increase in demand for our soc sip high speed memory test systems  driven by our new product introductions 
net product revenue from sales of our memory test systems increased by million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to strong sales of flash memory devices as a result of greater demand for hand held consumer products  as well as expansion of our addressable markets into nand flash and flash final test 
service revenue in fiscal year accounted for million  an increase of million  or  compared to the million achieved in fiscal year the increase in service revenue is primarily attributable to our growing installed base 
net revenue in fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from the million achieved in fiscal year net product revenue in fiscal year was million  an increase of million  or  from the million achieved in fiscal year the increase in net product revenue was primarily a result of a higher volume of sales enabled by increased overall demand for our products 
net product revenue from our soc sip high speed memory test systems increased by million  or  with most of the sales being of the enhanced version of our series platform 
continued customer demand for our series platform increased our penetration in a breadth of applications  from next generation graphics and wireless gaming  to high end soc applications and digital consumer applications as well as soc solutions with rf capabilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we experienced some weakness in demand for our soc sip high speed memory test systems  particularly from sub contractors 
as a result  a higher portion of our net revenue during the latter part of fiscal has come from our idm customers 
sales of our memory test systems also contributed to the net product revenue increase  with net product revenue from our memory test systems increasing by million  or 
substantially all of these sales were of the enhanced version of our versatest v series platform  which was introduced in late fiscal year this demand was primarily a result of strong sales of flash memory devices as a result of greater demand for hand held consumer products  as well as expansion of our addressable markets into nand flash and flash final test 
service revenue for fiscal year accounted for million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue for fiscal year the increase in service revenue is attributed to our growing installed base and increased services associated with a strong demand for products at the end of fiscal year we derive a significant percentage of our net revenue from outside north america 
net revenue from customers located outside of north america represented  and of total net revenue in fiscal years   and  respectively 
net revenue in north america was lower by in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  due to the continuing outsourcing by our north american customers to contract manufacturers in asia 
net revenue in asia including japan was higher by in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year we expect this trend of increasing sales in asia including japan to continue as semiconductor manufacturing activities continue to concentrate in that region 
cost of sales cost of products year ended october  over change over change in millions cost of products as a percent of product revenue cost of products 
cost of products consists primarily of manufacturing materials  outsourced manufacturing costs  direct labor  manufacturing and administrative overhead  warranty costs and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory  partially offset  when applicable  by benefits from sales of previously written down inventory 
the decrease in cost of products of approximately million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to a decrease in product shipments  cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs  million lower restructuring and separation costs and million lower excess and obsolete inventory related charges 
these decreases were partially offset by million higher freight and duty expenses and million higher warranty costs 
cost of products as a percent of net product revenue increased by percentage points in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily as a result of a decrease in product shipments and product mix  partially offset by less inventory write offs for discontinued products and cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs 
excess and obsolete inventory related charges in fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year in addition  we sold previously written down inventory of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the sales of previously written down inventory reduced cost of products as a percentage of product revenue by approximately and percentage points for fiscal years and  respectively 
our cost of products included approximately million of restructuring and separation charges in fiscal year  compared to approximately million in fiscal year our cost of products also included approximately million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expense in both fiscal years and as of october   we held inventory that was previously written down by million and is primarily composed of component raw material 
we continue to dispose of the remaining inventory on a recurring basis 
the increase in cost of products of million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was directly related to the increase in products shipped in the decrease in cost of products as a percent of net product revenue  compared to fiscal year  was a result of higher revenue  higher margins from both our product lines  less inventory write offs for discontinued products as well as our cost savings realized from our move to a new manufacturing model 
this decrease was partially offset by higher performance based variable compensation costs in fiscal year excess and obsolete inventory related charges in fiscal year were million  compared to million in fiscal year in addition  we sold previously written down inventory of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the sales of previously written down inventory reduced cost of products as a percentage of product revenue by approximately and percentage points for fiscal years and  respectively 
our costs of products in absolute amount are expected to increase or decrease with revenue 
as a percent of net product revenue  these costs will vary depending on a variety of factors  including the mix of system configurations in a particular period  competitive and other pressures on pricing and our ability to manage inventory levels to avoid excess and obsolete inventory charges 
in order to mitigate the risk and to manage our costs through the peaks and troughs of the semiconductor industry  we have streamlined our cost structure by reducing our fixed costs and adding more flexibility to our manufacturing model through the outsourcing of our manufacturing 
we believe our efforts will provide us with the flexibility to respond more rapidly to changes in industry conditions and to better capitalize on market opportunities during market upturns  and will provide us with more consistent cost of products 
cost of services year ended october  over change over change in millions cost of services as a percent of services revenue cost of services 
cost of services includes cost of field service and support personnel  spare parts consumed in service activities and administrative overhead allocations 
cost of services increased by million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the million increase in services revenue and our increased costs needed to support a higher installed base  partially offset by cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs 
cost of services as a percent of service revenue decreased by percentage points  from in fiscal year to  reflecting our better utilization of our service personnel as our installed base has increased as well as the benefit of the improved reliability and quality of our current product offering

r d costs have generally been expensed as incurred 
research and development expense declined by million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to lower project materials as well as cost savings realized from the streamlining of our infrastructure costs  partially offset by million higher share based compensation expenses 
r d expenses included approximately million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expenses in fiscal year  compared to approximately million for fiscal year research and development expense declined by million  or  in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to lower allocated cost from agilent prior to our separation as well as our continued progress in lowering our post separation cost structure partially offset by higher performance based variable compensation expenses and share based compensation expenses that were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r 
r d expenses decreased significantly as a percent of net revenue in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  primarily due to the increase in revenue despite higher performance based variable compensation expenses and share based compensation expenses that were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r 
r d expenses included approximately million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expenses in fiscal year  compared to no such expenses for fiscal year we believe that we need to maintain a significant level of research and development spending in order to remain competitive and  as a result  our research and development expenses have varied only modestly in dollars but vary more significantly as a percent of revenue 
as part of our separation from agilent  we have consolidated our r d teams in boeblingen  germany  for our principal soc developments and in cupertino  california  for our memory test products 
we believe this will help us concentrate on our technology innovation and decrease our time to market with new products

these increases were partially offset by cost savings from lower it and infrastructure costs we experienced subsequent to our separation from agilent 
sg a expenses included approximately million of sfas no 
r share based compensation expenses in fiscal year  compared to no such expenses for fiscal year in general  we believe our sg a expenses will decrease in absolute amount compared to prior periods due to our efforts to streamline our infrastructure and consolidate excess facilities 
the expected savings realized from our cost reduction efforts will be partially offset by incremental costs associated with operating as a stand alone public company  including professional fees such as legal  regulatory and accounting compliance costs that we will incur and share based compensation expenses that are now being recorded in accordance with sfas no 
r 
sg a expenses can fluctuate due to changes in commission expenses which are tied to changes in sales volume and customer mix

these charges were a result of agilent s restructuring plan and verigy s continued efforts aimed at reducing operational costs  primarily through closing  consolidating and relocating some sites and reducing and realigning our workforce 
as of october   we had approximately million accrued restructuring liabilities  compared to no accrued restructuring liability as of october  in accordance with the separation agreements with agilent  agilent retained and paid for all restructuring liabilities associated with its restructuring plan  except for those liabilities related to employees who were transferred to flextronics for whom we paid approximately million and are recognizing as expense over the transferred employees requisite service period

year ended october  in millions separation costs included in cost of sales separation costs included in operating expense total of separation costs net curtailment and settlement gains included in costs of sales net curtailment and settlement gains included in operating expenses total net curtailment and settlement gains net separation costs in connection with our separation from agilent  we incurred one time internal and external separation costs  such as information technology set up costs and consulting and legal and other professional fees 
for fiscal year  we incurred million in separation costs  of which approximately million was recorded in costs of sales 
for fiscal year  we incurred million in separation costs  of which approximately million was recorded in costs of sales 
for fiscal year  we incurred million in separation costs  all of which were recorded in operating expenses 
we do not expect any significant separation costs on a go forward basis 
in fiscal year  we also had a net curtailment and settlement gain of approximately million which pertained to agilent s us retirement plans and agilent s post retirement benefit plan 
these net curtailment and settlement gains which resulted from the separation of our business from agilent and the significant workforce reductions we incurred during fiscal year  were recorded by agilent in accordance with sfas no 
and were pushed down to our business 
provision for income taxes year ended october  in millions provision for income taxes we recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million for fiscal years ended  and  respectively 
through june   verigy s income tax expense reflected amounts based on agilent s consolidated tax profile  thus our income tax expense for the first seven months consisted of allocated expense from agilent 
since our separation from agilent on june   our tax expense is based on our new business model and tax status in the countries where we do business 
as of october  and  we had million and million of deferred tax assets due to temporary differences between the book and tax basis of the net assets  most of which were acquired upon our separation from agilent 
upon our separation from agilent  we did not retain any pre separation deferred tax assets or liabilities which had resulted from historical temporary differences  net operating losses and credit carryforwards 
we did  however  retain approximately million of prepaid tax assets upon our separation 
our effective tax rate varies based on a variety of factors  including overall profitability  the geographical mix of income before taxes and the related tax rates in the jurisdictions where we operate  restructuring and other one time charges  as well as discrete events  such as settlements of future audits 
we are subject to audits and examinations of our tax returns by tax authorities in various jurisdictions  including the internal revenue service 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of october   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million as of october  this decrease was primarily a result of cash used for the purchase of available for sale marketable securities partially offset by cash generated from our operations and financing activities 
prior to june   agilent used a centralized approach to cash management and financing of its operations 
as such  transactions relating to our business prior to june   were accounted for through the agilent net invested equity account for our business 
accordingly  none of the cash  cash equivalents or debt at the agilent corporate level had been assigned to our business in the historical combined and consolidated financial statements prior to june  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million of net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year the million cash generated during fiscal year was primarily due to net income from our operations of million  a million decrease in our receivables  a million increase in employee compensation and benefits and a million increase in deferred revenue 
these were partially offset by a decrease of million in payables to agilent  a decrease in income taxes and other taxes payable of million and a decrease in other current and long term assets and liabilities of approximately million 
also  in fiscal year  we had non cash charges of million from depreciation and amortization  million of inventory write offs  and million of sfas no 
r non cash share based compensation costs 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal year  compared to million of net cash used for operating activities in fiscal year the significant net cash generation in fiscal year  compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to our breakeven position in fiscal year versus a net loss of million in fiscal year in addition  an increase in our accounts payable and payables to agilent of million and net liabilities retained by agilent of million  and a million increase in deferred revenue contributed to the higher cash generation on fiscal year also  in fiscal year  we had non cash charges of million from inventory write offs  million of sfas no 
r non cash share based compensation costs  and million in depreciation expense 
these impacts were partially offset by a million increase in our accounts receivable  million decrease in income taxes payable  and million decrease in the net change of current assets and accrued liabilities 
also  in fiscal year  we had a non cash net million curtailment and settlement gain 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the million of net investment was primarily related to million invested in available for sale securities and million of cash payments for site set ups and leasehold improvements  partially offset by million of proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale marketable securities 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bonds  government securities and auction rate securities  and reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of shareholders equity  net of tax 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  certain auction rate securities failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  verigy recorded a temporary impairment within other comprehensive loss of approximately million net of tax of million at october  related to these auction rate securities 
verigy s marketable securities portfolio as of october  was million 
the portfolio includes million at cost invested in auction rate securities of which  million at cost are currently associated with failed auctions  all of which have been in a loss position for less than months 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
as a result  we have classified those securities with failed auctions as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the investing activity in fiscal year was comprised of approximately million for the new erp and it infrastructure set up costs  million relating primarily to capital expenditures for test and computer equipment  office furniture as well as new research and development equipment for use in product and application development and approximately million for new site set ups as well as leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal year was million  compared to million in fiscal year the million of net cash proceeds was comprised of approximately million from the exercise of employee stock options  million from contributions by participants of our espp plan  and approximately million for excess tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options and the vesting of restricted share units 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year was million  compared to cash provided by agilent to us of million for fiscal year in fiscal year  the million was primarily comprised of million of initial public offering proceeds  million of capital contributions from agilent  plus additional cash infusion from agilent of million that our business required prior to our separation 
on june   we used a part of our initial public offering proceeds to repay agilent million plus accrued interest that we had borrowed from agilent under a short term revolving credit facility that we entered into with agilent on june  this credit facility has been terminated as of october  on october   we completed the organizational structure of our china legal entity as well as the purchase of the net assets of our china operations from agilent  which were valued at approximately million 
other following our separation from agilent  agilent had provided us services and access to resources necessary for our operations 
these services and resources included facilities management  site information technology infrastructure  use of various applications and support systems  as well as employee related services for transitional employees remaining with agilent 
the total transition services we received from agilent totaled million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
as of october   these transition services had ended 
as of october   we released agilent from all guarantees or other security obligations that they had entered into on our behalf 
these guarantees and security arrangements related to real property lease deposits and guarantees  security for company credit card programs and other credit arrangements and required deposits with governmental trade and tax agencies 
as of october   verigy replaced all the cash deposits that agilent had made for us on our behalf and also released agilent from all guarantees and security obligations that they had made for us on our behalf 
we have contractual commitments for non cancelable operating leases and vendor financing arrangements 
we have in the past provided lease residual value guarantees on these financing arrangements and we have no other material guarantees or commitments 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on normal ongoing operations of our business and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global economics and markets 
our cash balances are generated and held in many locations throughout the world 
local government regulations may restrict our ability to move cash balances to meet cash needs under certain circumstances 
we do not currently expect such regulations and restrictions to impact our ability to pay vendors and conduct operations throughout our global organization 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities of approximately million  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditure and other liquidity needs at least through the next twelve months 
we may require or choose to obtain debt or equity financing in the future 
we cannot assure you that additional financing  if needed  will be available on favorable terms or at all 
contractual obligations and commitments contractual obligations our cash flows from operations are dependent on a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  inventory management and the timing of tax and other payments 
as a result  the impact of contractual obligations on our liquidity and capital resources in future periods should be analyzed in conjunction with such factors 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at october  in millions total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years operating leases commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers other purchase commitments long term liabilities total operating leases 
commitments under operating leases relate primarily to leasehold property 
following our separation  we have entered into long term lease arrangements for our corporate headquarters in singapore  our us headquarters in cupertino  california  and our boeblingen  germany facility  the site of our series platform development 
we have also entered into long term lease arrangements for our asic development office in colorado  as well as other sales and support facilities around the world 
commitments to contract manufacturers and suppliers 
we purchase components from a variety of suppliers and historically we have used several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products 
during the normal course of business  we issue purchase orders with estimates of our requirements several months ahead of the delivery dates 
however  our agreements with these suppliers usually allow us the option to cancel  reschedule  or adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed 
typically purchase orders outstanding with delivery dates within days are non cancelable 
therefore  only approximately of our purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm  non cancelable  and unconditional commitments 
we expect to fulfill the purchase commitments for inventory within one year 
in addition  we record a liability for firm  non cancelable  and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts 
such liabilities were million as of october   and million as of october  these amounts are included in other current liabilities in our combined balance sheets at october  and october  other purchase commitments 
these commitments relate primarily to contracts with professional services suppliers  which include third party consultants for legal  finance  engineering and other administrative services 
with the exception of our it service providers  our purchase commitments from professional service providers are typically cancelable with a notice of days or less without significant penalties 
our agreement with our primary it service provider requires a notification period of days and includes a termination charge of up to approximately million in order to cancel our long term contract 
long term liabilities 
long term liabilities relate primarily to million of defined benefit and defined contribution retirement obligations  million of extended warranty and deferred revenue obligations and approximately million of other long term liabilities 
upon our separation from agilent  the defined benefit plans for our employees located in germany  korea  taiwan  france and italy were transferred to us 
with the exception of italy and france  which involve relatively insignificant amounts  agilent completed the funding of these transferred plans  based on of the accumulated benefit obligation level as of the separation date  by contributing approximately million into our pension trust accounts during fiscal year verigy made approximately million of contributions to the retirement plans during fiscal year we expect expenses of approximately million in fiscal year for the retirement plans that have been transferred to us 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no material off balance sheet arrangements as of october  or october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk with the exception of japan  where products are sold primarily in yen  our products are generally sold in us dollars 
services and support sales are sold primarily in local currency when sold after the initial product sale 
as such  our revenue  costs and expenses  and monetary assets and liabilities are somewhat exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our global operating and financing activities 
we have implemented a hedging strategy that is intended to mitigate our currency exposures by entering into foreign currency forward contracts that have maturities of three months or less 
these contracts are used to reduce our risk associated with exchange rate movements  as gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset exchange losses and gains underlying exposures 
not withstanding our efforts to mitigate some foreign currency exposures  we do not hedge all of our foreign currency exposures  and there can be no assurances that our efforts will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
verigy does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent adverse movement in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above 
as of october  and october   the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
prior to our separation from agilent  agilent hedged net cash flow and balance sheet exposures that were not denominated in the functional currencies of its subsidiaries on a short term and anticipated basis and gains or losses associated with agilent s derivative instrument contracts that had been allocated to us 
as such  the historical results of our business prior to june   reflected the hedging program in place at agilent 
investment and interest rate risk we account for our investment instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for investments in debt and equity securities 
all of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
our marketable securities include commercial paper  corporate bond and government securities and auction rate securities 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
however because we classify our debt securities as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or declines in fair value are determined to be other than temporary 
should interest rates fluctuate by percent  the value of our marketable securities would have changed by approximately million as of october  and our interest income would have changed by approximately million for our fiscal year auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to thirty five days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  certain auction rate securities failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
based on an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  verigy recorded a temporary impairment within other comprehensive loss of approximately million net of tax of million at october  related to these auction rate securities 
verigy s marketable securities portfolio as of october  was million 
the portfolio includes million at cost invested in auction rate securities of which  million at cost are currently associated with failed auctions  all of which have been in a loss position for less than months 
the funds associated with the securities for which auctions have failed will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured
