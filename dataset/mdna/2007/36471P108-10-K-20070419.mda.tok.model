our stores feature an extensive selection of leading national and regional brands as well as our company s owned brands 
we tailor our merchandise assortments to take advantage of our customers seasonal and regional or local preferences 
we seek to combine this broad product offering with superior customer service based on our store associates extensive product knowledge and outdoor related experience 
since its origin in  our brand name has had a heritage of strong appeal and relevance to consumers who participate in outdoor sports and recreation activities  based on our we live outdoors culture and theme 
from to  our predecessor operated a nationwide catalog business that  by  included retail stores 
in and  holiday companies  which at the time owned and operated a group of retail sporting goods stores  acquired these gander mountain retail stores  formed our company and began to build a new outdoor lifestyle business 
in march  we began transforming our market position from a traditional specialty store to a large format  category focused store by opening new stores in a large format and increasing the selling space within our original  small format stores 
prior to march  our typical store was approximately  square feet 
our large format stores range from approximately  to  square feet  with our current focus primarily upon stores of  to  square feet with an outside selling area 
our large format stores generally are located with convenient access to a major highway and have a warehouse style shopping environment characterized by concrete floors  open bar joist ceilings  high density racking and wide aisles 
to further build upon our brand s reputation for high quality and exceptional value  we are outfitting certain stores with additional features such as brick and stone accents  log wrapped columns  and improved branding  fixture  flooring and signage elements 
the larger format enables us to offer more products and services to our customers 
most of our large format stores offer all terrain vehicles atvs 
in january  we and tracker marine group  a division of bass pro shops  announced that effective in spring  the popular tracker marine group boat brands will be featured in our stores 
brand offerings will be tailored in each location based on market and store dynamics and customer preferences 
for the spring season  the initial rollout of the tracker brands will occur in approximately to of our large format stores 
in  approximately stores carried an assortment of fishing and recreational boats 
our large format stores offer unique features and specialized services  including a full service gunsmith shop  a full service archery pro shop  archery target lanes  and a power shop performing repairs for atvs  boats and other engines 
some of the large format stores also include a bait shop that opens early for the convenience of our customers 
nearly all of our stores have a gander mountain lodge  which is an in store meeting room available for public use  where we provide hunter safety classes  outdoor skills seminars and other community focused activities 
we utilize outside selling areas adjacent to some of our large format stores to display additional offerings of larger items such as atvs  boats  kayaks  trailers and canoes 
these increase the efficiency of our stores and also give those products greater visibility 
as of february   of our stores were in our large format 
we are utilizing several strategic and operating initiatives aimed at improving our merchandise offerings  enhancing profitability and expanding the number and geographic diversity of our stores 
we measure performance using such key operating statistics as comparable store sales  sales per square foot  gross margin percentage and store operating expenses  with a focus on labor  as a percentage of sales 
we also measure and evaluate investments in our retail locations  including inventory and property and equipment 
inventory performance is primarily measured by inventory per square foot and by inventory turns  or the number of times store inventory turns over in a given period  and amounts of owned inventory at various times based on payment terms from our vendors 
the most significant investments in property and equipment are made at the time a store is opened by us 
we believe that the overall growth of our business will allow us to generally maintain or increase our product gross margins 
increased merchandise volumes should enable us to improve our purchasing leverage and achieve greater support throughout the supply chain 
the mix of merchandise in our total sales also influences our product gross margins 
as we continue sales and store growth  a number of other factors may impact  positively or negatively  our product gross margin percentage  including the introduction of new product categories with varying gross margin percentage characteristics  changes in the merchandise mix at our current locations  differences in merchandise mix by geographic location  price competition  clearance activities in connection with seasonal inventory management  closeout sales in connection with store relocations and consolidations  sourcing of products from locations outside the united states  vendor programs  and supply chain enhancements 
in addition  our gross margin is impacted by store occupancy and distribution costs 
we monitor these costs in absolute dollars and as a percentage of sales 
the most significant store operating expenses are labor and related employee benefits and advertising 
our employee benefits include health insurance  the cost of which continues to increase faster than the general rate of inflation 
we continually monitor this cost and review strategies to effectively control increases  but we are subject to the overall trend of increases in health care costs 
advertising costs are monitored as a percentage of sales 
these costs are largely variable  which allows us to actively manage them to facilitate achieving our sales  gross margin percentage and store operating contribution objectives 
store operating contribution  which is calculated by deducting a store s operating expenses from its gross margin  is used to evaluate overall performance on an individual store basis 
general and administrative expenses are monitored and controlled as a percentage of sales 
we have made significant investments in infrastructure  including our information systems  distribution capabilities and personnel 
our current infrastructure facilitates our planned opening of stores 
we expect these expenses to decrease as a percentage of sales over time 
pre opening expenses will continue to be related to store openings  including relocations 
these expenses will fluctuate based on the number and timing of new store openings 
inventory turns are based on cost of sales and average inventory for the applicable period 
we recognize that our inventory turns may be lower than those of other retailers  which we believe is due  in part  to the categories of merchandise we carry  including firearms  and the large quantities of merchandise we use in our in store displays 
we believe we have the opportunity to enhance our supply chain to improve our inventory turns 
additionally  in merchandise categories that experience slower inventory turns  we continue to work with vendors to increase our trade credit terms to reduce our investment in owned inventory 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to improve our inventory turns or inventory investment 
identification of appropriate new store sites is essential to our growth strategy 
we believe our focus on our larger store size and our ability to utilize either recycled  or second use  facilities or build to suit locations provides us with increased opportunities to find optimal real estate locations on attractive terms 
we evaluate and invest in new stores based on site specific projected returns on investment 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  selected items in the statements of operations as a percentage of our sales fiscal year ended weeks weeks weeks february  january  january  sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses store operating expenses general and administrative expenses pre opening expenses gain on insurance settlement gain on contract settlement income loss from operations interest expense  net debt conversion charge income loss before income taxes income tax provision net income loss column does not add due to rounding sales consist of sales from comparable stores  new stores and non comparable stores 
a store is included in the comparable store base in its fifteenth full month of operations 
a relocated store returns to the comparable store base in its fifteenth full month after relocation 
new store sales include sales from stores we opened during the current period 
non comparable store sales include sales in the current period from our stores opened during the previous fiscal year before they have begun their fifteenth month of operation 
during the quarter ended july   we changed this internal measurement from the fourteenth month to the fifteenth month to better reflect comparable sales activity in the stores and minimize the effect of grand opening activities 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of merchandise  freight  distribution  inventory shrinkage and store occupancy costs 
store occupancy costs include rent  real estate taxes and common area maintenance charges 
store operating expenses include store associate payroll  taxes and fringe benefits  advertising  maintenance  utilities  depreciation  insurance  bank and credit card charges and other store level expenses 
general and administrative expenses include all expenses associated with operating our corporate headquarters 
pre opening expenses consist primarily of payroll  rent  recruiting  advertising and other costs incurred prior to a new store opening 
fiscal year ended february  compared to fiscal year ended january  sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from sales of million from fiscal and fiscal new stores not included in the comparable store sales base  a comparable store sales increase of million and a million sales decrease from stores closed during but open during and changes in other revenue 
our comparable store sales decline of is the result of comparing the weeks of fiscal to weeks  not the actual weeks  for fiscal in fiscal  we opened eight new stores  including one relocated store  and added  square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
during fiscal  we opened new stores  including two relocated stores  and added million square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
comparable store sales decreased for fiscal primarily from weak sales in our first half of fiscal comparable store sales in our fiscal third quarter increased and were approximately flat in our fiscal fourth quarter at 
our fiscal fourth quarter was negatively impacted by particularly warm weather in our northern states in december  which adversely affected apparel and footwear 
the slower first half of fiscal is primarily reflective of i reduced spending in advertising and promotions  ii our focus on our everyday low price strategy that resulted in fewer promotions to drive customer traffic  and iii lower levels of clearance merchandise available to customers 
cannibalization from some of the new store openings and new competition entering some of our markets continues to reduce our overall level of comparable store sales 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal with no product category changing its sales mix more than  except the firearms ammunition category 
our firearms ammunition category continues to gain market share with a significant increase in comparable stores sales and increased sales penetration of basis points 
the power sports category increased its sales penetration by basis points  driven largely by atv sales at new large format stores and increased penetration of boat sales in our second year with this category 
the apparel footwear category experienced a decline in its share of the sales mix  primarily driven by weather factors 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the more significant factors primarily affecting gross margin during fiscal year were an initial product margin increase of approximately basis points as a result of continued benefits from increasing scale  the positive impact of our everyday low price strategy on our pricing structure  higher penetration of our owned brand merchandise  and lower clearance inventory coupled with better management of clearance merchandise and pricing  an approximately basis point negative impact from the change in our product mix  an approximately basis point favorable impact from increased co branded credit card revenues  an approximately basis point favorable impact from improved leverage from distribution costs  an approximately basis point negative impact from increased store occupancy costs as a result of reduced leverage from lower comparable store sales and lower sales per square foot at our newer  less mature stores  an approximately basis point negative impact from reduced vendor discounts for new stores as a result of opening fewer new stores with lower inventories for those new stores  and an approximately basis point negative impact from the continuation in the trend toward higher freight in costs as fuel prices increased 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  store operating expenses decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal advertising expense decreased approximately basis points due to our decision to reduce advertising in the first half of the fiscal year and shift a portion of advertising expenditures from print media to local radio in the second half of the fiscal year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal primarily as a result of sales leverage from increasing scale and cost controls 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened eight new stores in fiscal and new stores in fiscal  including relocations 
pre opening expenses on a per store basis declined slightly due to continued efficiencies in store opening processes and cost control  with the exception of costs related to one significantly larger store 
gain on insurance settlement 
during our third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a gain of million in connection with an insurance settlement resulting from flood damage at one of our stores 
gain on contract settlement 
during our first quarter of fiscal  we received a million non recurring payment relating to the termination of our contract with the former provider of our co branded credit card services in consideration of the lost opportunity 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average net borrowings used to fund our growth  including the placement of million of convertible debt in august and the addition of a million term loan to our credit facility in march average interest rates on our credit facility were approximately basis points higher in fiscal than in fiscal the interest rate in effect on our credit facility at february  and january  was and  respectively 
debt conversion charge 
in december  we completed a private placement of million of our common stock 
the purchase price was paid with million in cash and the tender of our outstanding million convertible note in exchange for the issuance of  shares of common stock 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non cash charge of million representing the fair value of the common shares issued in excess of the shares that were issuable under the original convertible note agreement executed in august income tax provision 
we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal or  due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net loss 
our net loss was million for fiscal  as compared to net loss of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  sales 
sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from sales of million from fiscal and new stores not included in the comparable store sales base  offset by a comparable store sales decrease of million  or  and a million sales decrease from closed stores and changes in other revenue 
in fiscal  we opened new stores  including two relocated stores  and added million square feet of retail selling space  a increase 
comparable store sales decreased for fiscal as we experienced reduced sales across all but one of our product categories 
overall  we believe sales performance in fiscal year was negatively impacted by  among other factors  cannibalization from some of the new store openings and new competition entering certain of our markets 
in addition  sales in the second half of fiscal were impacted by the weather  directly  from unseasonable weather patterns in certain of our operating markets  and  indirectly  from the impact of three devastating hurricanes and the resulting downturn in consumer confidence  much of which we believe was driven by higher energy prices 
overall  the sales mix for fiscal was relatively consistent with fiscal  except for the power sports category  which increased its share of the sales mix  driven largely by atv sales at new large format stores and sales of atv accessories 
our firearms business continued to gain market share  reflecting consistent gains as a percentage of the sales mix 
the apparel footwear category experienced a slight decline in its share of the sales mix  primarily driven by weather factors 
marine accessories sales produced a positive comparable store sales result for the year and an increase in the overall sales mix as a result of the expansion of the marine products offering and our increased focus on that market 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  gross profit decreased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal major factors primarily affecting gross margin during fiscal year were an initial product margin increase of approximately basis points  a negative impact of approximately basis points resulting from the absence of a co branded credit card program for a significant part of fiscal as well as different terms under the new card provider  aggressive seasonal clearance sales of merchandise in the second and third quarters of fiscal negatively impacting gross margin by approximately basis points  changes in our product mix  primarily increased sales penetration of lower margin categories such as firearms and atvs and less penetration of higher margin apparel and footwear  accounted for a decrease of approximately basis points  a negative impact of approximately basis points from increased store occupancy costs as a result of reduced leverage from lower comparable store sales and lower sales per square foot at our newer  less mature stores  and a negative impact of approximately basis points from higher distribution costs as a result of higher fuel costs and inefficiencies at our distribution center 
store operating expenses 
store operating expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  store operating expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal advertising expense decreased basis points due to more focused advertising that resulted in less spending  offset by the effect of reduced leverage in labor costs and depreciation primarily due to the comparable store sales decline and lower sales in less mature stores 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased basis points to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily due to reduced leverage from the comparable stores sales decline and increased legal fees 
pre opening expenses 
pre opening expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we opened new stores in each of fiscal and fiscal  including two relocated stores in each year 
the reduced pre opening expenses on a per store basis are due to improved efficiencies in store opening processes and cost control 
gain on contract settlement 
during our first quarter of fiscal  we received a million non recurring payment relating to the termination of our contract with the former provider of our co branded credit card services in consideration of the lost opportunity 
interest expense  net 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from higher average net borrowings used to fund our growth during fiscal  including the placement of million in convertible debt in august average interest rates on our credit facility were basis points higher in fiscal than in fiscal our average interest rate in effect at january  and january  was and  respectively 
income tax provision 
we did not record an income tax provision for fiscal or  due to the uncertainty of the realization of the net operating loss carryforwards 
we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
net loss 
our net loss was million for fiscal  as compared to net income of million for fiscal  due to the factors discussed above 
quarterly results of operations and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors  including the timing of new store openings and related expenses  profitability of new stores  weather conditions and general economic conditions 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuation  with the highest sales activity normally occurring during the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  which are primarily associated with the fall hunting seasons and the holiday season 
in recent years  the second half of our fiscal years have generated approximately to of our annual sales  including new store sales 
in addition  our customers demand for our products and therefore our sales can be significantly impacted by unseasonable weather conditions that affect outdoor activities and the demand for related apparel and equipment 
our grand opening activities surrounding our new store openings can also cause fluctuations in sales when compared to operating periods in later months 
it is for this reason we include a new store in our comparable store sales base in its fifteenth full month to minimize the effect of grand opening activities 
this seasonality also impacts our inventory levels  which tend to rise beginning approximately in april  reach a peak in november  and decline to lower levels after the december holiday season 
our pre opening expenses have and will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  primarily due to the timing of store openings 
we typically incur most pre opening expenses for a new store during the three months preceding  and the month of  it s opening 
in addition  our labor and operating costs for a newly opened store can be greater during the first one to two months of operation than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new store openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs and store labor and operating expenses 
due to these factors  results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for a full fiscal year 
see note to our financial statements included in this report for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for inventory  property and equipment and pre opening expenses to support our new store growth plans and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses 
until the completion of our initial public offering  our main sources of liquidity were equity investments by  and advances from  holiday companies and its affiliated entities  and borrowings under our credit facility 
the following chart summarizes the principal elements of our cash flow for the past three fiscal years and the number of stores opened during the period 
cash flow summary fiscal year ended weeks weeks weeks february  january  january  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities total net decrease increase in cash details of financing activities repayments borrowings under credit facility  net proceeds from sales of common stock  net proceeds from exercise of stock options and stock sales proceeds from long term debt reductions in long term debt repayments of notes with affiliates net cash provided by financing activities store openings  including relocated stores net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the overall million decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to a million increase in non cash expenses depreciation  debt conversion expense and stock based compensation expense that increased our net loss but did not require the use of cash  and increased funding of approximately million from accounts payable balance increases  due to improved vendor terms and increased atv  boat and firearm s inventories that typically carry more favorable payment terms  offset by an increase of million in funds used by increased receivables and million in funds used by increased prepaid expenses and other assets  driven primarily by growth in our business and increased prepaid rent of million  due to the timing of our fiscal year end 
we also used million less for inventory growth in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the opening of only eight new stores in fiscal versus new stores in fiscal however  boat and atv inventory at the end of fiscal was million higher than at the end of fiscal  due to our increasing mix of large format stores that carry atvs and the expansion of our boat business  which requires product presentations as early as february in certain stores to prepare for the spring selling season 
we also held higher levels of fishing product inventories at the end of fiscal  as part of an effort to have merchandise sets done earlier in our season  with which we have had success in other categories in fiscal the million decrease in net cash used in operating activities in fiscal compared to fiscal  partially reflects the lower levels of inventories in the fiscal new stores as well as the success of our efforts to reduce inventory in all of our stores 
the reduced use of cash resulting from the inventory reduction on a per store basis was partially offset by less funding through accounts payable balances  due in part to increased sourcing of foreign product 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities consists entirely of purchases of property and equipment  net of proceeds received from sales of assets and insurance proceeds 
we use cash for leasehold improvements and equipment to open new and relocated stores and to remodel and upgrade existing stores 
we opened  and new stores in fiscal  and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment also include purchases of information technology systems and expenditures for our distribution facility and our corporate headquarters 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the financing activities during these periods were primarily related to financing the increased inventory levels and property and equipment purchases for store openings and  to the extent of the highly seasonal nature of our business  operating losses primarily incurred in the first six to eight months of our fiscal years 
equity financing december on december   we agreed with the holder of our million floating rate convertible subordinated note due august   to amend and restate the note in order to i eliminate the right to convert the note into shares of our common stock and to ii eliminate the floating rate feature of the note and fix the interest rate at per year  a reduction of basis points 
the holder of the note was a trust  the annual income beneficiary of which is our chairman  david c 
pratt 
following the amendment of the note  the trust assigned the note to a newly formed limited liability company managed by mr 
pratt and comprised of certain pratt family trusts  the current beneficiaries of which are mr 
pratt or members of his immediate family 
on december   we entered into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold  shares of our common stock to the pratt llc for an aggregate purchase price of million  or per share 
the per share price of the stock purchase was equal to the closing bid price per share of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on december  the purchase price for the shares was paid by surrendering the note for cancellation of the million in principal due thereunder and by delivering million in cash for the balance of the purchase price 
the net cash proceeds from the stock purchase  after deducting the expenses incurred to complete the deal  were approximately million  and were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
the funding of this transaction and issuance of the shares occurred on december  the modifications to the note and subsequent tendering and cancellation of the note in a short time period  was deemed to be an in substance conversion and  in effect  represented a modification to the conversion price 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash debt conversion charge in the amount of million 
this charge was required because the note was tendered as consideration for equity shares and we issued additional shares beyond the number of shares issuable in the original note agreement 
us generally accepted accounting principles require that the resulting incremental million shares issued  valued at the fair value  be reflected as a debt conversion charge in our statement of operations 
the shares were not registered under the securities act of upon issuance 
we are obligated to file a shelf registration statement for resale of the shares and use our best efforts to cause the shelf registration statement to become effective under the securities act of within days after the closing date of the stock purchase 
placement of subordinated unsecured convertible note august on august   we completed a private offering of a million subordinated unsecured convertible note in a transaction exempt from registration pursuant to rule promulgated under the securities act of  as amended 
the note was convertible into our common stock at any time by the holder at an initial conversion price of per share 
the conversion price had no reset feature and adjusted only for dividends  stock divisions or combinations  recapitalizations and similar occurrences 
the note had a maturity date of august  and bore interest at per annum for the first two years  payable semi annually 
the proceeds from the note were used to reduce the outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
transaction costs associated with the placement were approximately  this note was canceled in december as part of the equity financing described above 
other financings during july  we completed the purchase of an aircraft and financed million of the million purchase price with a term note 
the term note matures in seven years and has a fixed annual interest rate 
the note is collateralized by the aircraft 
we received million in proceeds from the sale of the aircraft we replaced 
during fiscal  we purchased information technology equipment totaling million financed through capital lease transactions 
during fiscal  we purchased property and equipment totaling million financed through capital lease transactions 
for one particular store location  we entered into a lease containing a bargain purchase option that is exercisable upon the cancellation of a note obligation by the economic development authority in the region 
we capitalized this lease obligation  resulting in the recording of building and equipment of million with a corresponding lease obligation of million 
these capital lease purchases are excluded from the caption purchases of property and equipment in our statements of cash flows for fiscal and fiscal as they did not require the use of cash 
on april   we closed the initial public offering of our common stock  selling  shares of common stock  including the underwriters over allotment  at a price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to us of million 
transaction costs were million and have been reflected as a reduction of paid in capital 
the proceeds were used to eliminate our outstanding note payable to holiday companies in the amount of million and reduce million of outstanding indebtedness on our credit facility 
credit facility background 
to meet our liquidity and capital needs  we entered into a credit facility with fleet retail finance in fiscal fleet retail finance was subsequently acquired by bank of america  na as amended in february  this credit facility provided for revolving loans in an aggregate amount of up to million including up to million in the form of letters of credit 
in february  we completed an amendment to our credit facility to increase our availability under the facility from million to million and extend the maturity date to june in september  we exercised our option to increase the facility to million 
availability under the facility may be further increased to million  subject to certain conditions including the absence of default 
other substantive terms of the facility were not materially changed by the february amendment or the september increase 
in november  we amended our credit facility to adjust the level of ebitda and operating cash flow covenants  as defined in the credit agreement 
the november amendment also specifies quarterly  rather than annual testing of the operating cash flow covenant beginning on january  and continuing each quarter thereafter 
on march   we amended and restated our credit facility 
the principal purpose of the amendment was to add a million term loan to the credit facility 
effective may   we amended our credit facility to adjust the level of the ebitda covenants for the months of april through july the credit facility continues to specify that testing of the ebitda covenant is required when our availability is less than of the lesser of a the revolving credit facility maximum on any given day or b the borrowing base  as defined and adjusted for certain reserves 
it also continues to specify quarterly testing of the operating cash flow covenant 
other substantive terms of the agreement were not materially changed in the may amendment 
effective february   we amended our credit facility in order to have the million of cash received from our december stock sale be taken into consideration in determining ebitda  for pricing purposes only  to allow us to borrow at lower interest rates 
at the time of the amendment and based on current ebitda levels at that time  this change resulted in a reduced interest rate of basis points relative to the revolving credit facility 
pricing also was modified on the million term loan  with prime borrowings reduced by basis points and libor borrowings reduced by basis points 
the table below summarizes pertinent information regarding our credit facility as of each of the three fiscal years ending february  february  january  january  in thousands revolving credit facility available term loan outstanding borrowings outstanding letters of credit borrowing availability interest rate at year end agreement maturity june june june term loan 
in addition to the revolving credit facility  our credit facility includes a million term loan 
the amount of the term loan is not deducted in determining availability under the revolving credit facility  except to the extent that the balance of the term loan exceeds approximately to of the eligible borrowing base 
the term loan matures on june  and bears interest at either a over the higher of i bank of america s prime rate or ii the federal funds rate plus  or b libor plus 
this additional financing was obtained to maintain the liquidity levels necessary to fund continued growth and seasonal cash flow needs 
availability 
the actual availability under the amended credit facility is limited to of eligible credit card receivables plus the lesser of to of eligible inventory or of the inventory s liquidation value  in each case  net of specified reserves and less any letters of credit outstanding 
interest on the outstanding indebtedness under the revolving portion of the credit facility currently accrues at the lender s prime commercial lending rate plus to depending on our ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  or  if we elect  at the one  two  three or six month libor plus to depending on such ebitda 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by interests in substantially all of our assets 
outstanding borrowings under the credit facility  including the term loan  as of february  and january   were million and million  respectively 
our total remaining borrowing capacity under the credit facility  after subtracting letters of credit  as of february  and january   was million and million  respectively 
covenants 
financial covenants under the credit facility require that operating cash flow and ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  meet certain levels as adjusted over time 
the credit facility continues to specify that testing of the ebitda covenant is required when our availability is less than of the lesser of a the revolving credit facility maximum on any given day or b the borrowing base  as defined and adjusted for certain reserves 
it also requires quarterly testing of the operating cash flow covenant 
the february amendment also provided that the million raised in our december stock sale may be utilized in the calculation of the operating cash flow covenant for a month period effective december the credit facility also contains other covenants that  among other matters  restrict our ability to incur substantial other indebtedness  create certain liens  engage in certain mergers and acquisitions  sell assets  enter into certain capital leases or make junior payments  including cash dividends 
we were in compliance with all covenants as of february  and january  income taxes net operating losses 
we did not record a tax provision for the three fiscal years ending february  due to accumulated operating losses 
due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss carry forwards  we have determined the realization of the tax benefit related to our net deferred tax asset is uncertain at this time and a valuation allowance was recorded for the entire balance of our net deferred tax asset 
in  we determined that a change in ownership  within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code  occurred effective february  this change in ownership imposes a limitation on the amount of our net operating losses that we may deduct for tax purposes in any given year 
we have federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million expiring between and the amount of our net operating loss carry forwards subject to the section limitation was million at february  unrestricted net operating losses carry forwards were million 
we do not expect this limitation to materially impact our future tax provision for financial reporting purposes 
future capital requirements our future capital requirements will primarily depend on the number of new stores we open  the timing of those openings within a given fiscal year and the need to fund seasonal operating losses 
these requirements will include costs directly related to opening new stores and may also include costs necessary to ensure that our infrastructure  including technology and distribution capabilities  is able to support a larger store base 
we opened  and new stores in each of fiscal years  and  respectively  including one or two relocated consolidated stores in each year 
our cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal and fiscal we currently plan to open new stores in fiscal  including three relocations and expect our total capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately to million  including capital expenditures to improve certain existing stores 
however  business conditions  business strategy or other factors may cause us to adjust these plans 
additional needs for capital include funding seasonal inventory levels  including foreign purchases and seasonal losses from operations 
in  we began a significant effort to upgrade our merchandise and information systems that will provide enhanced efficiencies in buying  receiving  payables management and provide better and more detailed operating information for decision making and continued supply chain improvement 
we expect to continue to evaluate  modify and update our information systems over the next several years 
we believe that we will be able to service our existing stores from our distribution center through fiscal and into fiscal we have undertaken a study to analyze our future distribution requirements 
we believe we will need to expand our distribution capabilities in the next two to three years as we continue to add new stores 
other future capital requirements may include an investment for an expansion into another distribution channel in addition to our retail channel 
we can provide no assurances at this time as to the timing of such an expansion  or whether such an expansion will occur 
we intend to satisfy our capital requirements in fiscal with cash flows from operations  funds available under our credit facility and equipment financing leases 
however  if capital requirements for our business strategy change or other factors change our capital requirements  we may need to seek additional debt or equity financing in the public or private markets 
there is no assurance that financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
beyond fiscal  we anticipate needing additional financing to grow our business 
interest rate risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
our floating rate indebtedness was million at february  and million at january  if short term floating interest rates on our average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding for each of the respective fiscal years 
we have not contracted for any derivative financial instruments 
we have no international sales  however  we import certain items for sale in our stores 
substantially all of our purchases are denominated in us dollars 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended february  we cannot assure you that inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition in future periods

under this transition method  stock based compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements for granted  modified  or settled stock options and for expense related to our employee stock purchase plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the effective date of january  in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the amount of compensation expense for stock based awards to be recognized during a period is based on the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
we estimate option forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from those estimates 
cost is recognized using a straight line amortization method over the requisite service period  which typically is the vesting period 
as a result of adopting sfas r  our income from operations and net loss for fiscal year were negatively impacted by million

critical accounting policies and use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in connection with the preparation of the financial statements  we are required to make assumptions  make estimates and apply judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that we believe to be relevant at the time the financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  we review the accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and such differences could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our financial statements included elsewhere in this report  and readers should review those policies for additional information 
we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
inventory valuation we maintain inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we reduce inventory costs for estimates of vendor allowances  as described below 
valuation reserves are established based primarily on forecasted consumer demand  inventory aging and obsolescence 
if our estimates regarding consumer demand are inaccurate or other changes impact demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we also establish inventory shrink reserves 
we estimate a provision for these losses based on independent  periodic physical inventory counts 
we accrue for anticipated physical inventory losses on a location by location basis  based on a number of factors  including historical results 
if our estimates regarding inventory losses are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses in excess of our established reserves that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in demand or price that would indicate to us that our inventory valuation may be too high or too low at this time 
vendor allowances we receive allowances in the form of reductions to amounts owed and or payments from vendors related to volume rebates  new store purchases  cooperative advertising allowances and other purchase discounts 
amounts to be received from a vendor are estimated on a monthly basis and are recognized as a reduction of costs of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
we record an estimate of earned allowances based on actual and estimated volumes of merchandise purchased from these vendors 
the majority of these vendor allowances are based on specific contract terms with our vendors 
beginning in fiscal  we agreed with our vendors to eliminate proof of performance requirements on substantially all of our contracts 
accordingly  vendor monies that support our advertising programs have been recorded as a reduction in the cost of inventory  and are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold when the inventory is sold 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future  undiscounted net cash flows estimated by us to be generated by these assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
our impairment loss calculation contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values and to determine the useful lives of the assets 
using this impairment review methodology  we recorded a long lived asset impairment charge of million in fiscal if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates regarding these factors  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
costs associated with exit activities the calculation of our location closing liability requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding the timing and duration of future vacancy periods  the amount and timing of future lump sum settlement payments and the amount and timing of potential future sublease income 
when making these assumptions  we consider a number of factors  including historical settlement experience  the owner of the property  the location and condition of the property  the terms of the underlying lease  the specific marketplace demand and general economic conditions 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to additional charges that could be material 
we are not aware of any events or changes in circumstances that would require calculation of a location closing liability at this time 
insurance we retain a portion of the risk related to certain general liability  workers compensation  property loss and employee medical and dental claims 
liabilities associated with these losses are calculated for claims filed  and claims incurred but not yet reported  at our estimate of their ultimate cost  based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates due to the impact those changes have on our interest expense on borrowings under our credit facility 
our floating rate indebtedness was million at february  and million at january  if short term floating interest rates on the average fiscal and fiscal variable rate debt had increased by basis points  our annual interest expense would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively  assuming comparable borrowing levels 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our average amount of floating rate indebtedness outstanding for each of the respective fiscal years

we have no international sales  however  we import certain items for sale in our stores
