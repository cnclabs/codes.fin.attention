restatements on july   the company announced that  at the recommendation of the audit committee  the board of directors had created a special committee of independent directors special committee to conduct a review of our historical stock option practices 
as a result of its investigation  the special committee found  among other things  that some of the original measurement dates used by the company for option grants were not adequately supported by contemporaneous records  and therefore the measurement dates used by us for accounting purposes required adjustment 
the special committee concluded that the evidence did not establish that the errors which it identified resulted from fraud or intentional misconduct by our current senior management 
based on the special committee s findings and its own review of the facts  the board of directors concluded that there was no fraud or intentional misconduct by any current member of senior management 
the board also concluded that it has confidence in the integrity of the company s chief executive officer  dr 
levy gerzberg  and the company s chief financial officer  mr 
karl schneider 
based on information obtained from the special committee s review and additional work undertaken by the company  management has concluded  and the audit committee has agreed  that the company should restate certain previously filed financial statements  to reflect additional stock based compensation expense with regard to certain past stock option grants 
the corrections made in the restatements relate to options covering approximately million shares 
these adjustments amounted to an additional stock based compensation expense of million and million in and  respectively  and a benefit of million in there was no tax impact of these additional stock based compensation expenses due to the full valuation allowance on our tax assets 
in connection with the restatement  the company is recording additional non cash adjustments that were previously considered to be immaterial relating to the timing of revenue recognition  accrued expenses  amortization of premiums and discounts on investments  additional expense related to options granted to a consultant and the calculation of amortization of stock based compensation relating to a business combination in the company is also recording losses under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  to record the losses on investment of the prior ownership of oren semiconductor  inc under the equity method of accounting which was subsequently acquired by zoran in these additional adjustments resulted in a cumulative expense of million  including million of tax expense  for the periods through through  we applied accounting principles board apb opinion no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb opinion no 
apb no 
 non cash  stock based compensation expense was recognized for any option for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date 
because each of the options identified below other than those which we have determined should be accounted for variably was deemed to have an exercise price below the market price on the appropriate measurement date  we should have recognized a charge for each of those options under apb no 
 in an amount equal to the number of shares covered by such options  multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the appropriate measurement date 
that expense should have been amortized over the vesting periods of the options 
starting in  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
as a result  for  the additional stock based compensation expense required to be recorded for each of the options identified below was equal to the incremental fair value of those options on the appropriate measurement date over the remaining vesting periods of those options 
we did not record such stock based compensation expenses under apb no 
or sfas no 
r in our previously issued financial statements  and that is the reason for the restatement in this report 
to correct our past accounting for stock options  we recorded additional pre tax  non cash  stock based compensation expense of a million for the periods to under apb no 
and b the remaining million for under sfas no 
r 
the fair value of the options is being recorded using the accelerated amortization method under fin over the respective vesting periods of the awards 
consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the securities and exchange commission sec  the company has organized the grants with respect to which an accounting adjustment is required into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  the company applied the relevant accounting standards to determine the measurement date for every grant within each category 
the company recorded accounting adjustments as required  resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects 
the company organized the grants where adjustments were required as follows company wide option grants where optionees were added or grant amounts were changed after the option list was complete  or where insufficient contemporaneous documentation of the grant date exists 
for seven company wide refresh and retention grants made between and  the company determined that some employees who were omitted from the option grant list were added to the list after the stated grant date  and that the number of shares covered by option grants to some employees was not finally determined until after the stated grant date 
further  in and  insufficient contemporaneous documentation of the stated grant date existed 
as a result of these issues  the company restated its historical financial statements to increase stock based compensation expense by approximately million  recognized over the vesting periods of the relevant options 
re priced options 
in august  after consideration of relevant information  the compensation committee rescinded its april grant  and its june grant  to executives and other key employees 
the company thereafter reissued the grants in august at the time  in consultation with our external advisors  we determined that these transactions did not require variable accounting 
as a result of the special committee review of our historical stock option practices  we have reassessed the circumstances surrounding these transactions with our external advisors and have determined that the grants should have been accounted for variably 
as a result  the company restated its historical financial statements to increase stock based compensation expense by a cumulative net amount of approximately million  recognized over the vesting periods of these options 
acquisition related options 
the company determined a grant given to retain employees hired in connection with an acquisition in october should have been accounted for variably 
as a result  the company restated its historical financial statements to increase stock based compensation expense by approximately million  recognized over the vesting periods of these options 
improper measurement dates for non refresh stock option grants 
the company revised the measurement dates for certain grants made to new hires and for promotional and other miscellaneous non refresh grants made between and as a result of approvals that were obtained subsequent to the stated grant dates or as a result of administrative delays or errors and a small number of stock option grants to non executives that were determined to have been established retrospectively 
as a result  the company restated its historical financial statements to increase stock based compensation expense by approximately million  recognized over the vesting periods of these options 
in the aggregate  we have recorded additional stock based compensation expense for the periods through of approximately million on stock option grants made from through the incremental impact from recognizing stock based compensation expense resulting from the investigation of past stock option grants is as follows dollars in thousands expense benefit fiscal year cumulative effect at december  the cumulative effect of all of the restatements through december  increased additional paid in capital by million from million to million  increased accumulated deficit by million from million to million  and decreased total stockholders equity by million from million to million 
all the restatements of financial statements  financial data and related disclosures described in this report are collectively referred to in this report as the restatements 
in december  the company amended options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock held by dr 
gerzberg and mr 
schneider to increase the exercise price of those options to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the revised measurement date so that these options are no longer subject to a penalty tax under irc section a 
we have not amended  and we do not intend to amend  any of our other previously filed annual reports on form k 
we have amended our quarterly report for the period ended march  concurrent with the filing of our annual report on form k  and we do not intend to amend any of our other previously filed quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatements 
we present restated quarterly financial information for each of the quarters in and in selected quarterly financial information unaudited included in this report 
the impact of the restatements on the interim periods of each of the first three quarters of and each of the quarters of are disclosed in selected quarterly financial information unaudited included in this report 
internal controls based on the definition of material weakness in the public company accounting oversight board s auditing standard no 
 an audit of internal control over financial reporting performed in conjunction with an audit of financial statements  the restatement of financial statements in prior filings with the sec is a strong indicator of the existence of a material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting 
however  the company has concluded that the control deficiencies that resulted in the restatement of the previously issued consolidated financial statements did not constitute a material weakness as of december  because management determined that as of december  the company s internal controls were effective 
the sec may disagree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors  and there is a risk that its inquiry could lead to circumstances in which we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec  or otherwise take other actions not currently contemplated 
in addition  the sec may issue guidance on disclosure requirements related to the financial impact of past option grant measurement date errors that may require us to amend this filing or prior filings with the sec to provide additional disclosures pursuant to this guidance 
any such circumstance could also lead to future delays in filing our subsequent sec reports and delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
as a result of the investigation of its historical stock option practices  we analyzed zoran s internal control over financial reporting for periods before january   and determined that the company did not have sufficient safeguards in place to monitor its control practices regarding stock option pricing and related financial reporting and to foster an effective flow of information between those responsible for stock option pricing and those responsible for financial reporting 
inadequate training  communication and coordination in and among the company s human resources  stock administration  legal and finance functions prevented the company from assuring that stock options were priced and accounted for correctly  primarily for the years through from through  in compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and evolving accounting guidance  the company implemented improved procedures  processes and systems to provide additional safeguards and greater internal control over its stock option granting and administration 
these improvements included documenting and assessing the design and operation of internal controls  segregating responsibilities  adding reviews and reconciliations  and redefining roles and responsibilities  implementing a new equity accounting system and a new stock administration function  and implementing  prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the practice of using the receipt of the final board or compensation committee approval as the grant and measurement date for stock option grants 
as a result of the recommendations of the special committee of our board of directors and deliberations of the compensation committee of our board of directors  we have adopted the following policies governing all stock option grants all option grants must be approved by the compensation committee or the board of directors  the authority to approve option grants may not be delegated 
option grants including officer  vice president  rank and file  promotional and new hire grants are generally considered at regularly scheduled quarterly meetings of the compensation committee or the board of directors  and action may not be taken by unanimous written consent 
grants are generally effective as of the later of i the second trading day following the company s public announcement of its financial results for the preceding quarter or ii the date of the board or committee meeting 
grants should be recorded promptly in the company s option accounting database  and grantees should receive prompt written notification of their grants 
the annual focal review process will identify a specific date to complete the process of generating recommended grant amounts  after which the recommendations will be submitted to the compensation committee or the board of directors for approval 
board or committee minutes are to be drafted and circulated to directors for comment as soon as reasonably possible 
the special committee investigation and the company s related activities discovered no stock option grant after december  that required accounting adjustments 
related proceedings us attorney and sec requests 
on july   zoran disclosed in a press release that it received a grand jury subpoena from the office of the us attorney for the northern district of california requesting documents from through the present referring to  relating to or involving stock options  and also received an informal inquiry from the sec requesting documents related to zoran s stock option grants 
zoran intends to cooperate fully in all government inquiries or investigations 
there is no assurance that we will not be subject to inquiries related to our stock option grant practices by other federal  state or foreign regulatory agencies 
all such inquiries are likely to require us to continue to expend significant management time and incur significant legal and other expenses  and could result in civil and criminal actions seeking injunctions  fines or other sanctions that could adversely affect our business and financial results 
shareholder class actions and derivative litigation relating to historical stock option practices as discussed under item legal proceedings above  certain persons and entities identifying themselves as shareholders of zoran have filed class action complaints against the company and derivative actions purporting to assert claims on behalf of and in the name of the company against various of the company s current and former directors and officers relating to zoran s historical accounting for and disclosures related to stock options 
there may be additional lawsuits of this nature filed in the future 
we cannot predict the outcome of any such litigation  or the amount of time and expenses that will be required to resolve them 
if these lawsuits become time consuming and expensive  or if there are unfavorable outcomes in any of these cases  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
cost of related proceedings and restated financial statements 
we have incurred substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services in connection with the special committee investigation  our own related review work  the preparation of the restated financial statements  the sec and department of justice matters and inquiries from other government agencies  and the related litigation 
we have recorded expenses of million in aggregate through and we expect to incur additional costs in the future 
restatement and impact on financial statements the following information has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of the company s financial results  which is more fully described in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form k 
in connection with the restatement  the company is recording additional non cash adjustments that were previously considered to be immaterial relating to the timing of revenue recognition  accrued expenses  amortization of premiums and discounts on investments  additional expense related to options granted to a consultant and the calculation of amortization of stock based compensation relating to a business combination in for additional information  refer to note restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements

our products consist of integrated circuits and related products used in digital versatile disc  or dvd  players  movie and home theater systems  digital cameras and video editing systems 
we also provide integrated circuits  software and platforms for digital television applications that enable the delivery and display of digital video content through a set top box or television as well as digital imaging products consisting of semiconductor hardware and software that enable users to print  scan  process and transmit documents to computer peripherals that perform printing functions 
subsequent to our acquisition of emblaze semiconductor ltd 
on july   we also provide high performance  low power application processors  technology and products for the multimedia mobile telephone market 
through the acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc on june   zoran obtained oren s demodulator ic technology for the global high definition television market 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  who incorporate them in digital video and audio products for consumer and commercial applications 
revenues we derive most of our revenues from the sale of our integrated circuit products 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry in general  and for our products in particular  have decreased over the life of a particular product 
average selling prices for our hardware products have fluctuated substantially from period to period  primarily as a result of changes in our customer mix of original equipment manufacturer  or oem  sales versus sales to resellers and the transition from low volume to high volume production 
in the past  we have periodically reduced the prices of some of our products in order to penetrate the consumer market more broadly 
we believe that  as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further declines in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such changes with any certainty 
we also derive revenue from licensing our software and other intellectual property 
licensing revenue includes one time license fees and royalties based on the number of units distributed by the licensee 
annual licensing revenue can be significantly affected by the timing of a small number of licensing transactions  each accounting for substantial revenues 
accordingly  licensing revenues have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  on an annual basis 
in addition  we have historically generated a portion of our total revenues from development contracts  primarily with key customers  although development revenue has declined substantially as a percentage of total revenues over the past several years 
these development contracts have provided us with partial funding for the development of some of our products 
these development contracts provide for license and milestone payments which are recorded as development revenue 
we classify all development costs  including costs related to these development contracts  as research and development expenses 
we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development contracts 
while we intend to continue to enter into development contracts with certain strategic partners  we expect development revenue to continue to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
we recognize software license revenues in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
our software license agreements typically include obligations to provide maintenance and other support over a fixed term and allow for renewal of maintenance services on an annual basis 
we determine the fair value of our maintenance obligations with reference to substantive renewal rates within the agreement or objective evidence of fair value as required under sop no 
maintenance and support revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement 
we also receive royalty revenues based on per unit shipments of products embedding our software which we recognize upon receipt of a royalty report from the customer  typically one quarter in arrears 
cost of hardware product revenues our cost of hardware product revenues consists primarily of fabrication costs  assembly and test costs  and the cost of materials and overhead from operations 
if we are unable to reduce our cost of hardware product revenues to offset anticipated decreases in average selling prices  our product gross margins will decrease 
we expect both product and customer mix to continue to fluctuate in future periods  causing fluctuations in margins 
research and development our research and development expenses consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities and costs of engineering materials and supplies 
we are a party to research and development agreements with the chief scientist in israel s ministry of industry and trade and the israel united states binational industrial research and development foundation  which fund up to of incurred project costs for approved products up to specified contract maximums 
these agreements require us to use our best efforts to achieve specified results and require us to pay royalties at rates of to of resulting product sales  and up to of resulting license revenues  up to a maximum of to of total funding received 
reported research and development expenses are net of these grants  which fluctuate from period to period 
from time to time  we enter into non refundable joint development projects in which our customers reimburse us for a portion of our development costs 
we classify such reimbursement of development costs as an offset to research and development expenses as we retain ownership of the intellectual property developed by us under these development arrangements 
during  we received approximately  in such reimbursements 
we received million in reimbursements in we believe that significant investments in research and development are required for us to remain competitive  and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to product development  although such expenses as a percentage of total revenues may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  sales commissions  product promotion and other professional services 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase to support our anticipated growth 
income taxes our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of previously unbenefitted net operating losses which we have utilized to reduce taxable income for us federal income tax purposes and by our israel based subsidiary s status as an approved enterprise under israeli law  which provides a ten year tax holiday for income attributable to a portion of our operations in israel 
our us federal net operating losses expire at various times between and  and the benefits from our subsidiary s approved enterprise status expire at various times beginning in acquisitions oren semiconductor  inc on june   we completed our acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc oren  a privately held provider of demodulator ics for the global high definition television market 
prior to this acquisition  we had made investments in oren that represented a ownership interest 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired the remaining of oren s outstanding stock by means of a merger of oren with a wholly owned subsidiary of zoran  in consideration for which we paid an aggregate of million in cash and issued  shares of zoran common stock valued at million  for total consideration of million  to the other stockholders of oren and to employees holding oren options 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of oren have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we recorded retroactive losses under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  to record the losses on investment of the prior ownership of oren semiconductor  inc under the equity basis 
accordingly  our results of operations for the year ended december  include oren s operations for the full year  our results of operations for the year ended december  include oren s operations between june  and december  and  representing our portion of the losses incurred by oren between january  and june   and our results of operations for the year ended december  do not include oren s operations 
emblaze semiconductor ltd 
on july   we completed our acquisition of emblaze semiconductor ltd 
emblaze  a wholly owned subsidiary of emblaze ltd 
for million in cash 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
following the completion of the acquisition  the results of operations of emblaze have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  our results of operations for the years ended december  and include emblaze s operations for the full years presented while the results of operations for the year ended december  only reflect emblaze s operations between july  and december  segments during the first quarter of  we reorganized our operating structure to bring together our consumer electronic product lines under a single operating group  in recognition of the accelerating convergence of consumer products and our strategy of sharing technology among our various product lines 
the new consumer segment combines the former digital versatile disc dvd  digital television dtv and mobile product groups whose operations were previously reported separately 
we will continue to report the operations of our imaging group as a separate operating segment 
prior to july  we had four reportable segments digital versatile disc dvd  imaging  digital camera dc and digital television dtv 
subsequent to the emblaze acquisition in july  the operations of emblaze were combined with the digital camera group and the group was renamed the mobile segment 
each segment s primary products are based on highly integrated application specific integrated circuits  or asics  and system on a chip  or soc  solutions 
the dvd  imaging and dtv segments also license certain software and other intellectual property 
the dvd group provides products for use in dvd players and recordable dvd players 
the imaging group provides products used in digital copiers  laser and inkjet printers as well as multifunction peripherals 
the mobile group focuses on solutions for multimedia mobile phone products and digital camera products 
the dtv group provides products for standard and high definition digital television products including televisions  set top boxes and personal video recorders 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including bad debt  inventories  investments  intangible assets and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we generally recognize product sales to distributors at the time of delivery 
however  in some cases we grant rights of return or provide price protection arrangements 
when we are able to estimate the effect of such an arrangement  we establish a reserve for the estimated adjustment and recognize the balance of the product revenue associated with that arrangement upon shipment 
when we cannot reasonably estimate the effect of such an arrangement  we defer all revenue subject to the arrangement until the return right has lapsed or the price has become fixed 
the deferred revenue balance at the end of each accounting period was not material 
revenue from development contracts is generally recognized as the services are performed based on the specific deliverables outlined in each contract 
amounts received in advance of performance under contracts are recorded as deferred revenue and are generally recognized within one year from receipt 
costs associated with development revenues are included primarily in research and development expenses 
revenue from litigation settlement is recognized in accordance with the terms of the agreement when actual cash payments are received 
inventories are recorded at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
we write down inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions 
actual demand and market conditions may be different from those projected by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
inventory write downs are not reversed and permanently reduce the cost basis of the affected inventory until such inventory is sold or scrapped 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the delays or inability of certain customers to make required payments 
these allowances are estimated based on both specific identification of facts and circumstances with respect to each doubtful account 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we hold minority interests in private companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
at december   these investments totaled million 
the investments are in start up companies engaged in development and are expected to incur losses 
we record an investment impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value 
we assess the value of this investment principally by using information obtained from the investee  including historical and projected financial performance and recent funding events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or unexpected operating losses of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets exceeds their fair value 
we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
with respect to both goodwill and long lived assets  factors which could trigger an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  exiting an activity in conjunction with a restructuring of operations  current  historical or projected losses that demonstrate continuing losses associated with an asset or a significant decline in our market capitalization for an extended period of time  relative to net book value 
impairment evaluations involve management estimates of asset useful lives and future cash flows 
these estimates include assumptions about future conditions such as future revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  the fair values of certain assets based on appraisals  and industry trends 
actual useful lives and cash flows could be different from those estimated by our management 
this could have a material effect on our operating results and financial position 
prior to january   we applied apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
in accordance with apb no 
 a non cash stock based compensation expense was recognized for any options for which the exercise price was below the market price on the actual grant date 
the charge for the options with an exercise price below the market price on the actual grant date was equal to the number of options multiplied by the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the option shares on the actual grant date 
that expense was amortized over the vesting period of the option 
beginning january   we have accounted for stock based compensation using the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the use of option pricing models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short lived exchange traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected stock price volatility assumption was determined using the historical volatility of the company s common stock 
we determined that historical volatility is reflective of market conditions and a good indicator of expected volatility 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we also used historical volatility in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
we have elected not to adopt the alternative transition method provided in the fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas no 
r 
we followed paragraph of sfas no 
r to calculate the initial pool of excess tax benefits and to determine the subsequent impact on the additional paid in capital apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements for a detailed description 
additionally  the company has restated the pro forma expense under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k to reflect the impact of the restatement adjustments for the years ended december  and we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
considerable judgment is necessary to estimate the probability and amount of any loss from such contingencies 
an accrual is made when it is probable that a liability has been incurred or an asset has been impaired and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we accrue a liability and charge operations for the estimated costs expected to be incurred over the next twelve months of adjudication or settlement of asserted and unasserted claims existing as of the balance sheet date 
see note to consolidated financial statements  commitments and contingencies  for a detailed description 
we follow the liability method of accounting for income taxes which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequence of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
realization of deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
historical operating losses and continuing business uncertainty represent sufficient negative evidence which it was difficult for positive evidence to overcome under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded 
if the facts or estimates of future financial results were to change  increasing the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
with respect to mergers and acquisitions  we assess the technological feasibility of in process research and development projects and determine the number of alternative future uses for the technology being developed 
to the extent there are no alternative future uses we allocate a portion of the purchase price to in process research and development expense 
this expense is generally estimated based upon the projected fair value of the technology  as determined by a discounted future cash flow reduced by the cost to complete 
this analysis includes certain estimates and assumptions made by management 
for larger acquisitions  we have historically engaged an external appraiser to assist with the assumptions and models used in this analysis 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated and percentage changes from period to period years ended december  percentage change to to restated restated restated restated revenues hardware product revenues software and other revenues license revenues related to litigation settlement total revenues cost and expenses cost of hardware product revenues research and development selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets amortization of stock based compensation resulting from business combinations restructuring expense in process research and development total costs and expenses operating income loss interest income other income loss  net income loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss supplemental operating data product gross margin not meaningful year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase was a result of a million increase in consumer segment revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in the imaging segment 
within the consumer segment  license revenues related to the litigation settlement accounted for million of the increase while the remaining increase was primarily a result of increase in hardware product revenues of million 
the decrease in imaging segment revenues in was primarily due to a million decrease in hardware product revenues due to decrease in unit shipments 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in hardware product revenues was driven by growth in consumer segment product revenues 
within the consumer segment  hardware product revenues increased primarily due to a million increase in the mobile product line and million increase in the dtv product line  in each case driven by increased unit shipments offset by a reduction of million in the dvd product line attributable to reductions in unit shipments and average selling prices 
software and other revenues remained essentially unchanged at million and million in and  respectively 
cost of hardware product revenues cost of hardware product revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in costs was primarily a result of the corresponding increase in hardware product revenues 
as a percentage of hardware product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared to in hardware product costs for included adjustments resulting in a million decrease in inventory 
excluding the benefit of the net reduction in the inventory allowance  hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues would have been in with no significant change in the decrease in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues in to compared to the adjusted costs of in reflected a change in product mix as revenues from the lower margin dvd product line represented a smaller proportion of total hardware product revenue with a relative increase in revenue from the higher margin mobile and dtv product lines 
research and development research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
the increase in was primarily due to stock based compensation expenses of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  compared with stock based compensation expense of million in prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the inclusion of the operations of oren which was acquired in june for the full year in as well as continued investments in research and development across all of our segments 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to stock based compensation expenses of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  compared with stock based compensation expense of million in prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  million of expenses in connection with the ongoing stock option review  continued increases in marketing and field application support expenses to support revenue growth in our asia pacific markets and the inclusion of the operations of oren which was acquired in june for the full year in this increase was partially offset by the reduction of legal fees as a result of the completion of the mediatek litigation 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in from million in at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets acquired through the oak  emblaze and oren acquisitions which we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis for various periods extending through amortization of stock based compensation resulting from business combinations as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r during the first quarter of  we now record a charge for all stock based compensation expenses as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements and no longer record a separate charge for amortization of stock based compensation resulting from business combinations 
in  we recorded charges of million related to the amortization of amortization of stock based compensation resulting from business combinations primarily as a result of stock options granted in connection with the oak acquisition 
in process research and development there were no charges recorded for in process research and development during in  approximately million of the purchase price of oren semiconductor  inc was allocated to in process research and development for projects which had not reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
this amount was determined using management s estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser 
at december   there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired in process research and development 
interest income interest income increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of higher average cash and short term investment balances and the higher interest rates during provision for income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to utilization of previously unbenefitted net operating losses nols and state of israel tax benefits on foreign earnings 
the provision is primarily due to domestic income offset by previously unbenefitted purchased nols which when utilized reduce goodwill and not tax expense 
for the year ended december   the company reduced its income tax reserves by million 
this was due to an expiring statute of limitations and the settlement of a domestic income tax audit 
realization of deferred tax assets is based on our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
the valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable 
historical operating losses and continuing business uncertainty represent sufficient negative evidence which it was difficult for positive evidence to overcome under sfas no 
and accordingly  a full valuation allowance was recorded 
if the facts or estimates of future financial results were to change  increasing the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
we intend to maintain a full valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal of the valuation allowance 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase was a result of a million increase in consumer segment revenues and a million increase in imaging segment revenues 
within the consumer segment  the increase in revenues was primarily as a result of increase in hardware product revenues 
hardware product revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase in hardware product revenues was driven by growth in consumer segment product revenues by million and imaging segment product revenues by million 
within the consumer segment  hardware product revenues increased primarily due to revenue increases of million in the mobile product line  million in the dtv product line  in each case driven by increased unit shipments 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in the dvd product line due to reduced unit shipments 
the increase in imaging segment revenues was due to increase in unit shipments 
software and other revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in software and other revenues primarily resulted from decreases of million in the consumer segment and million in the imaging segment revenues 
within the consumer segment  software and other revenues decreased by million in the dvd product line and million in the mobile product line  partially offset by an increase of million in the dtv segment 
these changes were primarily due to the timing of new agreements 
cost of hardware product revenues cost of hardware product revenues was million in compared to million in this decrease in the cost of hardware product revenues was mainly due to lower unit costs primarily due to changes in product mix 
in addition  part of the unit cost reduction was due to charges recorded in for inventory write downs of million coupled with the reduction in our inventory allowances of million in as a result of the sale or disposal of inventory that had been fully written down in most of the inventory write downs in  as well as the sale of previously written down inventory in  primarily related to our dvd vaddis product and a companion chip 
the revenue recorded in associated with the sale of these previously written down products was approximately million 
partially offsetting these reductions in unit costs was an increase associated with increased unit shipments  primarily in the mobile product line 
as a percentage of hardware product revenues  hardware product costs were in compared to in the decrease in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues was primarily due to a change in product mix to a lower percentage of dvd products which generally have higher product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues than mobile and dtv products 
the inventory write down charges in coupled with the reduction in inventory allowances also contributed to the reduction in hardware product costs as a percentage of hardware product revenues 
research and development research and development r d expenses increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was driven primarily by the acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc in june and inclusion of emblaze operations acquired in july for the full year in r d expense included increased stock based compensation expense of million in  compared with a benefit credit of million in actual r d expenses in were offset in part by million of research grants received from the chief scientist in israel 
we did not receive any such grants in these grants are provided by the israeli government to fund specific r d projects 
we are not obligated to repay the grants  however  future royalties may be owed to the government if the r d activities result in commercial product sales 
we remain committed to investing in research and development to enhance our technology and development capabilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in from million in  representing a increase 
this increase was primarily due to increase in legal fees by million related to our patent litigation with mediatek  inc  continued increases in marketing and field application support expenses to support revenue growth in our asia pacific markets  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable by million to cover slow paying accounts and potential risk with increasing business in certain regions of the world and the inclusion of the oren and emblaze operations in selling  general and administrative expense included increased stock based compensation expense of million in  compared with a benefit of million in amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this increase was the result of amortization of approximately million of intangible assets acquired in the emblaze acquisition in july for the full year in and amortization of million of intangible assets acquired in the oren acquisition in june at december   we had approximately million in net intangible assets acquired through the oak  emblaze and oren acquisitions which we will continue to amortize on a straight line basis for various periods extending through amortization of stock based compensation resulting from business combinations amortization of stock based compensation resulting from business combinations was recorded primarily as a result of stock options granted in connection with the oak acquisition 
for the year ended december   these charges were million compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease for fiscal was due to the cancellation of options held by employees who terminated their employment during the year and the lower amortization associated with the graded vesting under the fin model 
restructuring expense there were no charges recorded for restructuring expenses during during the year ended december   we recorded restructuring charges of  due to the discontinuation of the sensor product line of the mobile group 
this charge included  related to the reduction in force of employees for severance and other termination expenses   for lease losses on abandoned office space and other miscellaneous legal and consulting fees of approximately  the remaining accrual balance at december  of  relating to facilities will be paid over the lease term through june in process research and development in  approximately million of the purchase price of oren semiconductor  inc was allocated to in process research and development for projects which had not reached technical feasibility and had no alternative future use 
accordingly  this amount was immediately expensed upon the acquisition date 
this amount was determined using management s estimates including consultation with an independent appraiser 
the value of in process research and development was determined using the multi period excess earnings method by estimating the expected net cash flows from the projects once commercially viable and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value using a discount rate of 
this rate was based on the industry segment for the technology  nature of the products to be developed  length of time to complete the project and overall maturity and history of the development team 
the net cash flows from the identified projects were based on estimates of revenue  cost of revenue  research and development expenses  selling general and administrative expenses  and applicable income taxes 
these estimates did not take into account any potential synergies that could be realized as a result of the acquisition 
at december   there have been no material variations from the underlying assumptions that were used in the original computation of the value of the acquired in process research and development 
there were no charges recorded for in process research and development during interest income interest income increased by million to million in compared to million in the increase was a result of the higher interest rates during provision for income taxes our effective tax rate differs from the us statutory rate primarily due to utilization of previously unbenefitted net operating losses and state of israel tax benefits on foreign earnings 
the provision is primarily due to domestic income offset by previously unbenefitted purchased nols which when utilized reduce goodwill and not tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million of working capital 
our operating activities generated cash of million during  primarily due to net income of million adjusted for non cash items such as amortization of million  depreciation of million and stock based compensation expense of million 
cash provided by operations also increased due to a net decrease of million in accounts receivable due to the timing of collections 
these increases were partially offset by a million increase in inventories to meet the increasing demand for our products  net decrease in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  goodwill and other long term liabilities totaling million and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the net purchase of investments of million 
in addition we spent million for purchases of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities during was million consisting of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and proceeds from the sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
our operating activities generated cash of million during  primarily due to non cash items such as amortization of million  depreciation of million  in process research and development expense of million and stock based compensation of million which offset our net loss of million 
cash provided by operations also increased due to decreases of million in net inventory primarily associated with our dvd product line due to reduction in supply chain inventory  million in prepaid expenses and other assets and increases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities  goodwill and other long term liabilities totaling million which were partially offset by a million increase in net accounts receivable due to higher revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period of cash used in investing activities was million during  principally reflecting the use of million in the acquisition of oren semiconductor  inc  partially offset by million of net proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
in addition we spent million for property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was million during and consisted of proceeds received from issuances of common stock through exercises of employee stock options and employee stock purchase programs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to the type of financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
contractual obligations the following is a summary of fixed payments related to certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter operating leases and license commitments purchase commitments total we believe that our current balances of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  and anticipated cash flow from operations  will satisfy our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements at least through the next months 
nonetheless  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned and will depend on many factors including  but not limited to the levels at which we maintain inventory and accounts receivable  the market acceptance of our products  the levels of promotion and advertising required to launch our new products or to enter markets and attain a competitive position in the marketplace  our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and technology roadmap  volume pricing concessions  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  technological advances  the response of competitors to our products  and our relationships with our suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require an increase in the level of working capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring and infrastructure needs 
additional capital may also be required for additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies 
to the extent that our existing resources and cash generated from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the terms of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to financial market risks including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars  although a portion of the cost of our operations  relating mainly to our personnel and facilities in israel  is incurred in new israeli shekels 
as a result  we bear the risk that the rate of inflation in israel or the decline in the value of united states dollar compared to the new israeli shekel will increase our costs as expressed in united states dollars 
we have not engaged in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations that may arise from changes in foreign exchange rates 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   a near term appreciation or depreciation of the new israeli shekel would have an immaterial affect on our financial condition
