table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of hypercom corporation s financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires companies to recognize the fair value of stock based compensation transactions in the statement of income 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms  risk free rates and dividend yield 
expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
we also use historical data to estimate option exercises and employee terminations within the valuation model 
the expected term of options granted is derived from an analysis of historical exercises and remaining contractual life of stock options  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends  and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our share based compensation expense  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little share based compensation expense 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be materially different 
for stock options with graded vesting terms  we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period on the accelerated method prescribed by fin rather than the straight line method 
we had approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options at december  that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts payment terms for product and service trade receivables generally range from to days depending on the circumstances of each order or service contract 
payment on trade receivables from long term contracts is generally received within four months of the milestone approval date 
any payments not received within the agreed upon due date are considered past due 
an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments is maintained 
such allowance is computed based upon a specific customer account review of larger customers and balances past due 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into our customers financial status  as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the account receivables to selling  general and administrative expense 
sales type leases certain sales of product are made under capital lease arrangements and are recorded as a sales type leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
lease contract receivables represent the total lease payments to be received reduced by lease payments already collected 
sales type lease revenues consists of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are earned 
an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio is recorded 
the allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sales type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or customer credit conditions deteriorate  the allowance for uncollectible sales type leases may need to be increased 
unearned income  including an interest and maintenance element  is the amount by which the original sum of the lease contract receivable exceeds the fair value of the equipment sold 
the interest element is amortized to lease income over the lease in a manner that produces a constant rate of return 
the maintenance element is amortized on a straight line basis over the lease term 
recognition of the interest and maintenance income did not exceed of our net revenues in  or during the fourth quarter of we made the decision to sell our uk lease business which comprised primarily all of our sales type leases 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  adjusted for absorption of manufacturing variances  which approximates actual cost  on a first in  first out basis 
we record reserves for estimated excess and or obsolete inventory on a product or part level basis based upon future demand and historical usage and establish a new cost basis for the respective item 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations  including the requirements of emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  statement of position  software revenue recognition  statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  staff accounting bulletins no 
and no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and other applicable revenue recognition guidance and interpretations 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally recognize product revenue  including sales to distributors  upon shipment of product 
we recognize services revenue when services have been provided and collection of invoiced amounts is reasonably assured 
routine recurring services include terminal repairs  help desk  on site technician visits  deployment and 
table of contents the provision of supplies 
in addition  we have transaction service and software revenue 
amounts received in advance of services being rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
revenues from long term contracts that require substantial performance of customized software and hardware over an extended period are recorded based upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones under the percentage of completion method 
operating lease revenue is recognized monthly over the lease term 
the cost of units  net of depreciation  leased under operating leases are included in the balance sheet under property  plant and equipment 
we accrue for warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables items can be divided into more than one unit of accounting 
an item can generally be considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
items which do not meet these criteria are combined into a single unit of accounting 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
in cases where there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s in an arrangement but no such evidence for one or more of the delivered item s  the residual method is used to allocate the arrangement consideration 
in cases in which there is not objective and reliable evidence of the fair value s of the undelivered item s  we defer all revenue for the arrangement until the period in which the last item is delivered 
product warranty we accrue for estimated warranty obligations when revenue is recognized based on an estimate of future warranty costs for delivered products 
such estimates are based on historical experience and expectations of future costs 
we periodically evaluate and adjust the accrued warranty costs to the extent actual warranty costs vary from the original estimates 
our warranty period typically extends from one to five years from the date of shipment depending upon the product 
costs associated with maintenance contracts  including extended warranty contracts  are expensed when they are incurred 
actual warranty costs may differ from our estimates 
legal contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  patent rights  and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against it  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  it would record additional charges as other expense during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
foreign currency all of our foreign subsidiaries and divisions use the us dollar as the functional currency 
accordingly  foreign currency translation gains and losses from remeasurement are included in current earnings 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currency are remeasured at period end exchange rates whereas non monetary assets  including inventories and property  plant and equipment  are reflected at historical rates 
during the years ended december   and we recorded an immaterial gains and losses on re measurement 
for the same 
table of contents periods  we recorded net losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax laws including rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
see note regarding the valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets 
we do not provide for federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries because earnings are reinvested and  in our opinion  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely 
overview of financial results the following overview will highlight certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years 
for the years ending december   and and any related interim periods reported we have reclassified certain revenues and related costs previously reported as part of products and other into services as it was determined that certain activities considered as other revenues and cost of sales more appropriately should be classified as service revenue and cost of sales 
the activities reclassified consisted principally of repair laboratory work  software and software development sales as well as consulting 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for amounts reclassified 
year for  we recorded net income of million per diluted share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million 
product revenue gains were achieved in central and eastern europe  russia and the commonwealth of independent states  middle east and africa  as well as mexico and south america from increased sales of our optimum t product 
we experienced declines in the multi lane sector in north america due to the completion of a significant order in the first half of as well as the effects of transitioning from a direct to indirect sales model for that product line  and we experienced declines in our pacific region due to reduction in product volume at a large customer in australia and a slow down in the new zealand market and emv migration 
our service revenues increased by in to million principally from gains in brazil due to new service contract awards  including servicing competitor products  as well as increased terminal sales which were put under existing service contracts 
the return to profit in from losses in and resulted from favorable impacts of our business review see note actions which improved profitability 
these actions resulted in a lower cost structure  a streamlined product line  an increase in revenues from newer bit products and the establishment of a global product marketing group 
as of december  we had million remaining in liabilities associated with the business review compared to million at december  during  million of the million was reversed out through earnings as a result of customers opting out of a particular warranty program and a change in severance benefits paid out 
the remaining liability balance at december  relates to a particular warranty matter in australia of million where we expect to replace certain faulty units in and the balance of an idle facility charge of million expected to be paid out through we also experienced a favorable impact of a gain on the sale of real property in hong kong and had a net positive contribution from interest income less interest expense and foreign exchange losses 
on december   we also acquired the assets of tpi software  llc tpi which resulted in a charge of million related to acquired in process research and development 
while this acquisition is expected to contribute significantly toward both our product and services offerings  the contribution in was not material 

table of contents on february   we acquired the assets of a services company in australia see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our cash and short term investments amounted to million as of december  this balance decreased from december  due to the acquisition of tpi  use of cash in operations  and our purchase of additional treasury shares 
year for  we recorded a net loss of million loss per share on revenues of million 
revenues for increased by over revenues of million due to gains in multi lane and processor sales markets in north america as well as in our service businesses  offset by declines associated with the completion of emv rollouts in europe and asia in and the completion of a significant portion of an outsource manufacturing contract in late for one of our larger global customers 
the net loss was most notably impacted by charges resulting from a comprehensive business review and the discontinuance of our uk lease business 
during the latter part of march  a change in senior management was made 
an interim chief executive officer and interim chief financial officer collectively interim management were appointed to replace the former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the interim chief executive officer  william keiper  was appointed as our chief executive officer and president in august and a new chief financial officer  tom liguori  was appointed in november interim management commenced a comprehensive review of our financial performance  market strategy  products  product development and life cycle management  and employee  customer and vendor relationships the business review 
the objective of the business review was to create a plan to improve profitability and customer relations  transition more rapidly to bit technology products  rationalize operations and reorganize our corporate structure 
the business review included the following actions and amounts implementing an end of product life cycle strategy  including identifying products and related inventory with near term end of life requirements resulting in charges of million  more aggressively addressing and correcting product performance issues  including negotiated warranty and product trade in trade out programs required for the end of product life cycle strategies resulting in charges of million  implementing certain workforce reductions  including members of the senior management team  sales  operations and manufacturing personnel  as well as moving certain research and development resources to lower cost foreign geographies  and compensation plan changes resulting in charges of million  vacating a leased building in phoenix  arizona due to the reductions in force resulting in a charge of million in future rental expense  net of estimated sublet recoveries  evaluating other assets and liabilities and evaluating the past underlying operating decisions or strategies supporting such assets and liabilities resulting in charges of million  investing in the implementation of a comprehensive product marketing function  and evaluating opportunities for short  medium and long term improvements in manufacturing costs 

table of contents the following table sets forth the restructuring and other charges recorded during in conjunction with the business review in thousands first second fourth quarter quarter quarter full year costs of revenue warranty charges and product return accruals inventory write downs one time termination benefits and related costs other total costs of revenue operating expenses one time termination benefits and related costs idle facility lease charge other total operating expenses non operating expenses and income taxes other  including tax impact of above entries total non operating expenses and income taxes there were no significant charges resulting from decisions and actions taken during the third quarter of as part of the business review 
the business review was completed as of december  while we believe significant progress has been made and strategic initiatives put in place as of december   we will continue to review and align our business as demands and markets change and evolve 
accordingly there could be additional charges in future periods arising from the decisions and actions related to ongoing business reviews 
in addition to the business review  we also evaluated our uk lease business during the fourth quarter of and decided to exit this business and sell the existing lease portfolio and related assets  resulting in its classification as a discontinued operation for all periods being presented 
we recognized a million loss on the write down of the uk lease business to its estimated fair value based on purchase offers received from potential buyers 
we continued to maintain our cash reserves  consisting of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  compared to million at december   despite funding the cash elements of the business review of million  and purchasing million of treasury stock  and without incurring any indebtedness to fund continuing operations 
year for  we recorded a net loss of million loss per share on revenues of million 
our revenue growth in was primarily due to bringing our new bit products to market  expanding our multi lane and qsr base  and serving the growing european market led by tightening security standards 
the results include a second quarter charge of million to write off all costs previously deferred under our contract with the brazilian health ministry 
the increase in revenues was tempered by a decline in gross profit as a percent of revenues resulting primarily from the aforementioned deferred contract charge in brazil 
to a lesser degree  the gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by pricing pressures in certain markets  a lower margin on a high volume contract with a domestic processor  sales to high volume multi lane and quick service restaurant customers  and incremental 
table of contents inventory reserves attributable to technology obsolescence induced by our new product offerings and altered market demand for dated products and components 
additionally  the gross profit percentage was negatively impacted by the reclassification of certain leases as operating leases rather than sales type leases 
operating expenses increased by million in  from million in to million in operating expenses represented of net revenues in versus in this increase was primarily due to costs for section of the sarbanes oxley act compliance and higher selling expenses principally related to accelerating expansion into certain markets in response to market opportunities and pre selling costs related to longer sales cycle multi lane contracts 
non operating expenses net interest expense  foreign currency losses and other income loss decreased by million in this decrease was primarily due to higher interest income as a result of our increased cash and short term investment balances as well as rising interest rates and lower interest expense as a result of reduced debt fees and the cessation of amortization of debt issuance costs in results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the operating results expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of future results

table of contents net revenue net revenue increased approximately million or in compared to this increase was comprised of an increase of million or in product revenue  and million or in services revenue 
the increase in product revenue of million was principally the result of increases in south america  principally brazil  of million  europe and the middle east of million  mexico  central america and caribbean of million and asian markets of million 
the gains were primarily related to the re entry into markets with our new optimum product line in brazil and mexico as well as the expansion of geographic markets in europe and the middle east 
offsetting most of the increases were declines in multi lane product of million due partially to the completion of large orders in the first half of and also general market conditions  a decline in australia new zealand of million due to a reduction in volume to a significant customer in australia and general softness in the new zealand market 
the increase in service revenues of million was principally the result of increases in our service operations in brazil and mexico as well as continued growth in our transaction services offering 
service revenues in brazil increased million from to due to additional service contracts added in and an increase in the installed base of terminals due to increased sales of terminals 
mexico services increased approximately million from to due to general growth in terminals under service contract and a new service contract entered into with a major customer 
we also experienced an increase in our transaction services revenues of approximately million due to adding new customers to the service as well as a general increase in volumes year over year 
offsetting these increases were declines in chile of million due to a general downsizing of operations in that country  multi lane of million due to less repairs required for the optimum product line  and the us repair laboratory of million 
cost of revenue and gross profit costs of revenue include the costs of raw materials  manufacturing and service labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  telecommunication cost  inventory valuation provisions as well as loan loss provisions with respect to sales type leases included in continuing operations 
total gross profit as a percent of revenue increased to in from in total gross profit in was impacted by million in charges related to the business review 
in addition there were approximately million in incremental inventory valuation provisions included in versus excluding these incremental charges  total gross profit as a percent of revenue was for product gross profit was in compared to in  excluding million of charges associated with the business review and million in incremental inventory valuation provisions 
this year over year decrease in product gross margin was principally attributable to a change in the mix of product sales with increases in lower margin geographies such as brazil as well as higher volumes of optimum terminals that do not have as high a margin as the legacy terminals that have been fully cost reduced and certain declines in selling prices to address strategic market conditions 
additionally  during the second quarter of product liabilities were reduced by a net million primarily as a result of two customers opting out of the warranty program offered as part of the business review 
however  in the third and fourth quarter of  we recorded charges in the amount of and million  respectively 
these charges related to a payroll tax charge associated with former employees in china and a settlement of a royalty claim associated with patented technologies used in our terminals with signature capture functionality 
there will be a royalty fee charged on our signature capture terminals going forward as well  but it will not significantly impact our gross profit on such terminals 
services gross profit percentage was in and in  excluding million of charges associated with the business review and million in incremental inventory valuation provisions 
this year over year decrease is principally due to additional overhead absorption related to the sale of our uk lease business and changes in the mix of service offerings due to more special service orders at higher margins occurring in versus 
table of contents research and development research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses as a percent of revenue was in compared to in research and development expenses for include severance and other termination costs of million and million in share based compensation  while includes million in incremental charges associated with the business review 
excluding these charges  research and development expenses decreased million from million of revenue in to of revenue million in primarily due to the move of certain us based research and development operations to lower cost off shore locations 
during december  we acquired the assets of tpi and approximately million related to acquired in process research and development 
this amount was written off at the date of the acquisition in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
business combinations accounted for by the purchase method fin as there was no alternative future uses 
management determined the value assigned to this asset through various methods including assistance from a third party valuation firm in valuing the tpi business 
as of the valuation date  there were seven projects that were considered to be in process 
the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of estimated cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the in process projects 
these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses  cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of the net return on the in process technology 
these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness 
we believe the assumptions used in valuing in process research and development are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain 
since the date of the purchase  we incurred development costs of less than million related to the acquired in process research and development  and should the projects continue to move toward commercialization  we estimate that future expenditures could approximate million over the next fiscal year 
as of december  none of the in process research and development projects had been completed  or postponed 
we expect the seven in process projects to be completed in the first quarter of selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  and facilities operations make up the selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense was for and for selling  general and administrative expenses of million for include million in payroll tax charges associated primarily with former employees in china  an incremental amount of share based compensation of million  offset by million in net favorable tax settlements in brazil  reductions in severance related liabilities and accounts receivable allowance recoveries 
excluding these amounts  sg a expenses for totaled million or of revenues 
sg a expenses in include million in incremental charges associated with the business review  consisting principally of million in severance and employment related charges  million in unrecoverable prepaid sales taxes associated with slow moving inventory and the expiration of utilization periods  million of future rent charges resulting from vacating a building located in phoenix arizona  as a result of reductions in personnel 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses include a charge of million for legal contingencies for certain tax cases covered under an amnesty program in brazil 
excluding these charges sg a expenses for totaled million or of revenue 
selling expenses have decreased principally due to the recognition of full effects of the cost reductions put in place as part of the business review 
during the third quarter of  we sold our portion of an office building in hong kong and we recorded a million gain on the sale 
the building was sold as management determined that the cost  size and layout of the facility were not appropriate for the functions performed in that facility 
we have relocated the hong kong operations to other leased space 

table of contents interest income  interest expense  and foreign currency we recognized million in interest income in compared to million in this increase is principally attributable to higher average cash  cash equivalent  and short term investments balances maintained throughout compared to and increasing yields on our cash investments 
we incurred interest expense of million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense is primarily due to the write off of debt issuance cost associated with the payoff in april of our floating rate option note payable as well as interest penalties incurred on the china payroll tax charges 
foreign currency loss was million in compared with million in the decrease in foreign currency expense is principally attributable to a relatively stabilized us dollar against our foreign currency exposures throughout as well as improved foreign currency management practices 
income tax expense income tax expense before discontinued operations for federal  state and foreign taxes was million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
income tax expense is principally comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during  we continued to provide valuation reserves on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
these reserves are subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas 
due to our net operating loss position and our valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets  the consolidated effective tax rates for and are not meaningful 
we do business in a number of different countries

income tax expense is principally comprised of income taxes associated with our profitable foreign locations 
during  we continued to provide valuation reserves on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
these reserves are subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas

tax authorities may scrutinize the various tax structures employed by us in these countries 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves  including our valuation allowance  to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense or reduction of our valuation allowance would result 
in addition  any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit could affect the individual items that comprise our fully reserved deferred tax asset balance 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and occasionally from borrowings under a line of credit and or other debt facilities 
during  our primary source of cash was cash generated by our operations as well as cash received from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of real property 
we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit during cash flows from continuing operations cash provided by operating activities is net income loss from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
cash used in continuing operating activities totaled million for compared to cash used in operations of million for  a year over year decline of million 
the amount includes million in cash expenses associated with the business review  and the amount included million of cash expenses associated with the business review 
exclusive of the business review expenditures  the decline in cash used in operations amounts to million and is principally related to changes in operating assets and liabilities offset by net income 

table of contents changes in operating assets and liabilities and the related impact on our operating cash flows consist of the following change accounts receivable inventories accounts payable other increase decrease in operating assets and liabilities the decrease in cash attributed to the increase in accounts receivable on relatively the same revenue base is generally associated with an increase in days sales outstanding due to extended payment terms for certain high credit rated customers which was offset by an increase in accounts payable as part of our cash management activities 
cash has also been significantly impacted due to increases in inventory levels primarily resulting from carrying components on the new bit line of products along with our legacy bit line of products and ordering in anticipation of sales forecasts to reduce expediting and other delivery costs 
other changes represents decreases in accrued payroll and related expenses  sales and other taxes and other liabilities as we paid down and made settlements on certain accruals existing at the end of cash flows from investing activities investing cash flows consist principally of capital expenditures and the net changes in cash associated with our investment of excess cash generated by operations or proceeds from liquidations of investments to fund operations  acquire capital assets or businesses and use in financing related activities such as the purchase of treasury stock or pay down of long term debt 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared to million in exclusive of the asset acquisition using million in cash and the sale of the real property which provided million in cash  the change is related to increased capital expenditures primarily for computer related upgrades and new implementations as well as investment activities surrounding the transfer of cash between investments held in cash equivalent accounts such as money market funds and certificates of deposit  and investments held in short term investments such as debt and equity securities with better yields 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in and million in during and  capital expenditures were principally for upgrades to computer software and hardware and equipment purchases 
we intend to spend approximately to million over the next twelve months for capital expenditures related to computer hardware and software upgrades  manufacturing equipment such as tools and dies and communication equipment 
cash flows from financing activities financing cash flows consist principally of the issuance of common stock due to the exercise of employee stock options  repayment of long term debt  and the purchase of treasury stock 
additionally  in we received cash from the payoff of notes receivable from two former principal stockholders 
there are no further related party note receivable balances 
during  cash used in financing activities was million compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the primary reasons for the decline in cash from financing activities of million were the early pay off of the company s debt associated with its headquarter location  increased purchases of treasury stock in and fewer proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
cash flows from discontinued operations see note and note cash flows from discontinued operations principally relates to our fourth quarter discontinuance of our uk lease business and our direct finance lease operation sold in the third quarter of 
table of contents cash flows from operations consist principally of net cash earnings from the uk lease business 
the decrease in operating cash flows provided by discontinued operations of million in over is the result of the sale of the uk lease business during the second quarter of cash flow generated in investing activities for of million relate to net proceeds from the sale of the uk lease business 
while the cash flows from discontinued operations of million in were significant to our change in cash and cash equivalents  we believe the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations will not cause us to be unable to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements due to our cash reserves and short term investments together with the ability to control certain cash outlays  such as the purchase of treasury stock 
should operating results from continuing operations prove unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
projected liquidity and capital resources at december   working capital and cash and cash equivalents were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million at december   respectively 
short term investments decreased million from million at december  to million at december  we believe that these cash reserves and short term investments combined with our ability to influence operating cash flows as well as certain investing and financing cash outlays  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through should operating results prove unfavorable  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods dollars in thousands 
less than after total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases minimum purchase obligations total minimum purchase obligations include all outstanding obligations to purchase goods or services at december  including agreements that are cancelable without penalty and agreements which are enforceable and legally binding 
we estimate that approximately of the outstanding purchase obligations at december  are non cancelable due to the customized nature of the order and the long lead time requirements 
debt amendments in march  we amended our credit agreement with wells fargo to decrease the line of credit availability to million and extend the expiration date until march  at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the credit agreement 
stock repurchase during august  the board authorized a stock repurchase program to allow the purchase of up to million of our common stock

table of contents of a rule b plan for the repurchase of up to million of common stock pursuant to the terms of an existing repurchase authorization 
during and  we purchased  and  shares of our common stock for and million  respectively 
there were no treasury stock repurchases during the repurchased shares were recorded as treasury stock and result in a reduction to stockholder s equity 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price per share of under the share repurchase programs 
the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend on market conditions and corporate considerations

 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised 
outlook in we intend to continue our focus on initiatives to drive profitability 
key initiatives include revenue and market share growth  expansion of our service offerings  introducing new products  improving gross margins and reducing operating expenses 
we have dedicated senior management teams to specifically address and manage these key initiatives 
with the continued introduction of our various products under our new optimum product family  and the introduction of a new service expansion strategy during  we believe we have a solid foundation to move forward on these key initiatives 
we will continue to see competitive pressures on a global basis as we and our major competitors try to expand our respective market share 
these pressures will generally serve to decrease average selling prices for certain products within certain geographies 
we intend to continue to offset declines in selling prices with increases in volumes together with further cost reductions in our products  as well as continuing to differentiate our product and total electronic payment solution offerings from our competitors 
we will continue to leverage our existing cost structure on anticipated higher revenues in many activities were examined and right sized as part of the business review and we anticipate carrying our new right sized organization into  with only limited strategic capital outlays and resource additions required to achieve our business plan 
we will continue to manage our balance sheet and leverage our working capital in instances where it can help meet the objectives of our key initiatives for recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued financial accounting standard interpretation no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   our cash equivalent investments are primarily in money market accounts and certificates of deposit and are reflected as cash equivalents because all maturities are within days from date of purchase 
our interest rate risk with respect to existing investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned which approximate current interest rates 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of december  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of december   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that our investments typically have interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
a substantial portion of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we do at times enter into these transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other asian and european currencies 
as a policy  we hedge the translation of our net investment in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses in the statement of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by our policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
we enter into forward or option contracts with our bank or other financial institutions to accomplish our hedging strategy 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real and british pound 
gains and losses on these contracts principally consist of mark to market adjustments which are recorded in earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
we do not purchase or hold any such derivative financial instruments for the purpose of speculation or arbitrage 
see risk factors international operations pose additional challenges and risks that if not properly managed could adversely affect our financial results elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
at present  we have no material long term debt obligations and there are no borrowings under our line of credit facility at december  as such  our interest rate risk is not significant with respect to existing debt 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
