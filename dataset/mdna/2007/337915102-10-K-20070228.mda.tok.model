net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of compared with for the third quarter of and for the fourth quarter of the decrease in net interest margin compared with the third quarter of resulted from an increase in deposit costs attributed to shifts in the deposit portfolio from lower cost transaction products to time deposits 
the decrease in net interest margin compared with the fourth quarter of reflected a similar shift in consumer preference for higher yielding deposit products as well as increased pricing pressure from a rising interest rate environment 
for the full year  net interest margin declined to compared with for  as the corporation s flexibly structured balance sheet provided opportunity to mitigate rising interest rates by shifting a portion of the investment portfolio into higher yielding loans and paying off higher cost borrowings 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis was million in the fourth quarter compared with million in the third quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of the decrease in fte net interest income compared with the third quarter resulted from net interest margin pressure  partially offset by an increase in average earning assets 
the increase in earning assets was driven by loan growth in the commercial portfolio and the corporation s decision to increase the size of the investment portfolio given the higher interest rate environment 
the decrease in fte net interest income compared with the fourth quarter of resulted from lower net interest margin 
fte net interest income for the full year was million  down from the million in the corporation executed a balance sheet restructuring initiative preventing additional margin pressure during the year 
average earning assets decreased million during  resulting from a million reduction in the average investment portfolio 
the majority of run off in the securities portfolio was used to fund loan growth  average loans increased million 
the corporation also used proceeds from maturing investments to pay down higher cost borrowings

the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   an increase of million and million from september  and december   respectively 
at december   the allowance for loan losses was of period end loans compared with at september  and at december  the allowance for credit losses is the sum of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments 
for comparative purposes the allowance for credit losses was at december  compared with at september  and at december  the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans increased to at december  compared with on september  and on december  firstmerit s total assets at december  were billion  an increase of million or compared with september  and an increase of million or compared with december  the increase from september  was principally due to an increase in commercial loans and in the investment securities portfolio 
the increase over december  was due to growth in portfolio loans  primarily in the commercial portfolio of million  or 
the majority of the loan growth over that time period was funded by cash flow from the company s maturing investment securities portfolio as part of a strategy to shift the mix of earning assets into higher yield categories 
total deposits were billion at december   an increase of million or from september  an increase of million or from december  core deposits  which exclude all time deposits  totaled billion at december   an increase of million or from september  and a decrease of million or from december  compared with september   the increase reflects new pricing initiatives aimed at capturing new transaction account balances

nonaccrual loans have been included in the average balances 
net interest income net interest income  the corporation s principal source of earnings  is the difference between interest income generated by earning assets primarily loans and investment securities and interest paid on interest bearing funds namely customer deposits and wholesale borrowings 
net interest income is affected by market interest rates on both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the level of earning assets being funded by interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities  the mix of funding between interest bearing liabilities  noninterest bearing liabilities and equity  and the growth in earning assets 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million compared to million for year ended december  the million decline in net interest income occurred because the million increase in interest expense was more than the million increase in interest income during the same period 
for the purpose of this remaining discussion  net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  to provide a comparison among all types of interest earning assets 
that is  interest on tax free securities and tax exempt loans has been restated as if such interest were taxed at the statutory federal income tax rate of adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense incurred to acquire the tax free assets 
net interest income presented on a fte basis is a non gaap financial measure widely used by financial services corporations 
the fte adjustment for full year was million compared with million in and million in net interest income presented on an fte basis decreased million or to million in compared to million in and million in the decrease from to occurred because the million increase in interest expense was more than the million increase in interest income during same period 
the decrease from to occurred because the million increase in interest expense was less than the million decline in interest income during the same period 
as illustrated in the following rate volume analysis table  interest income and interest expense both increased due to the rise in interest rates throughout the year 
the average yield on earning assets increased basis points from in to in increasing interest income by million 
similarly  the average yield on earning assets increased basis points from in to in increasing interest income by million 
lower outstanding balances on total average earning assets in caused interest income to decrease million from year ago levels 
average balances for investment securities were down from last year decreasing interest income by million  but higher rates earned on the securities mitigated the impact by increasing interest income by million 
average loans outstanding  up from last year  increased interest income by million while higher yields earned on the loans  also increased loan interest income by million 
over had a similar effect 
average balances for investment securities were down from decreasing interest income by million  but higher rates earned on the securities increased interest income by million 
average loans outstanding in  up from  increased interest income by million 
the cost of funds for the year as a percentage of average earning assets increased basis points from in to in as discussed in the deposits and wholesale borrowings section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operating results  the rise in interest rates was the primary factor in this increase

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income fte by average earning assets 
as with net interest income  the net interest margin is affected by the level and mix of earning assets  the proportion of earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rate spread 
in addition  the net interest margin is impacted by changes in federal income tax rates and regulations as they affect the tax equivalent adjustment 
year ended december  dollars in thousands net interest income tax equivalent adjustment net interest income fte average earning assets net interest margin the net interest margin for was compared to in and in as discussed in the previous section  the decrease in the net interest margin during was primarily a result of a drop in earning assets coupled with a shift in customer preference to higher yielding certificate of deposits 
the increase in over was a result of higher yields on loans and investments 
other income excluding investment securities gains  other income totaled million in an increase of million or from and an increase of million or from other income as a percentage of net revenue fte net interest income plus other income  less gains from securities was compared to in explanations for the most significant changes in the components of other income are discussed immediately after the following table

atm and other service charge fees have decreased million or 
this decrease was also volume driven 
bank owned life insurance income increased million or primarily due to death benefit proceeds received in there were no significant sales of investment securities during investment securities gains increased million in over primarily attributable to the other than temporary impairment loss of million on fhlmc and fnma perpetual preferred stock that was recorded in the fourth quarter of loan sales and servicing income increased million or in and million or in over million reflecting the slow down in mortgage activity due to interest rate increases 
investment services and insurance income decreased million in and in over primarily attributable to a drop in annuity sales in our retail branches 
federal income taxes federal income tax expense totaled million in compared to million in and million in the effective federal income tax rate for was compared to in and in during the statute expired on the consolidated federal income tax return  resulting in the release of tax reserves of million which had been established for tax issues from a previous acquisition 
as a result  the corporation recorded a million reduction in income tax expense 
additionally  million in federal and state tax reserves were established for pending audits and years open for review for various taxing authorities 
pursuant to the anticipated changes in the requirements under sfas accounting for income taxes and more fully described in note recently issued accounting standards  tax reserves have been specifically estimated for potential at risk items 
during  the internal revenue service completed their examination of the corporation s tax returns for the years ended december  and the corporation was successful in resolving anticipated issues at less than previous expectations 
as a result  the corporation recorded a million reduction in income tax expense 
of that amount  million related to issues resolved during the and year audits  and million for reserves no longer required related to bank owned life insurance 
further federal income tax information is contained in note federal income taxes to these consolidated financial statements

the increases generally reflect the annual employee merit increases 
pension and employee benefits were million in  an increase of million or over  primarily due to increased pension expense and health care costs related to self insured medical plans 
note benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements more fully describes the increases in pension and postretirement medical expenses 
taxes  other than federal income tax were down million primarily attributable to the successful resolution of multiple year and multiple jurisdictional non income tax examinations 
bankcard  loan processing  and other costs were up million consistent with the increase in volume in our credit card revenue 
professional services expenses increased million or in due to increased professional assistance in complying with the bank secrecy act and sarbanes oxley 
the efficiency ratio for was  compared to in and in the lower is better efficiency ratio indicates the percentage of operating costs that is used to generate each dollar of net revenue that is during  cents was spent to generate each of net revenue 
net revenue is defined as net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  plus other income less gains from the sales of securities

in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities have been classified as available for sale 
in this classification  adjustment to fair value of the available for sale securities in the form of unrealized holdings gains and losses is excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in the other comprehensive income section of shareholders equity 
at year end  the investment portfolio had a net unrealized loss of million  which compares to a loss of million at year end at year ends and  investment securities at fair value totaled billion and billion  respectively 
the decrease in the total portfolio occurred primarily in the mortgage backed security portfolio 
this decrease reflects the corporation s balance sheet deleverage strategy 
the corporation has not reinvested the cash flow from the maturing investment portfolio in order to improve its asset liability position 
also during  the corporation repurchased million shares its own stock in an accelerated share repurchase arrangement with goldman  sachs co

the estimated effective duration of the portfolio is and is estimated to shorten to given an immediate  parallel decrease of basis points in interest rates 
if rates were to increase basis points in a similar fashion  the duration would increase to 
the investment portfolio would be expected to generate million in cash flow over the next twelve months  given no change in interest rates

the increase in interest rates was the primary reason for the decline in mortgage loan originations and the decrease in balances retained in portfolio 
outstanding home equity loan balances decreased million or from december  as a result of discontinued marketing campaigns that drove up balances in over installment loans increased million or as customer preferences moved from home equity lines of credit to home equity fixed loans 
there is no predominant concentration of loans in any particular industry or group of industries 
most of the corporation s business activity is with customers located within the state of ohio 
allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded lending commitments the corporation maintains what management believes is an adequate allowance for loan losses 
the corporation and firstmerit bank regularly analyze the adequacy of their allowance through ongoing review of trends in risk ratings  delinquencies  nonperforming assets  charge offs  economic conditions  and changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
notes  and to the consolidated financial statements provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices 
the following tables display the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and at december  the allowance for loan losses was million or of loans outstanding  compared to million or at year end the allowance equaled of nonperforming loans at year end compared to at year end the increase in the allowance for loan losses is attributable to additional reserves that were established to address identified risks associated with the slow down in the housing markets and the decline in residential and commercial real estate values 
these reserves totaled million at year end and million at year end nonperforming loans have decreased by million over december  due to write downs which occurred in anticipation of a loan sale during the first quarter of these held for sale loans have been valued at their fair market value 
net charge offs were million including the allowance relating to loans held for sale in compared to million in and million in as a percentage of average loans outstanding  net charge offs and allowance for loans held for sale equaled in  in and in losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses as soon as they are identified 
during the fourth quarter of  management reclassified million of loans as impaired and arranged a loan sale of million to facilitate improved credit quality with the commercial loan portfolio 
of the loans identified as held for sale  million were classified as nonperforming and million were classified as performing 
the loan sale is scheduled to occur during the first quarter of additionally  management strengthened the allowance for loan losses by providing million of additional provision to establish reserves to address identified risks associated with the slow down in the housing markets and the decline in residential and commercial real estate values 
during the first quarter of  management observed that rising input costs such as plastic resins  steel and petroleum would impact certain segments of our commercial and industrial loan portfolio 
management also observed a higher level of nonaccrual loans from within previously identified criticized loan levels while the economy was in an early stage of recovery 
these observations led us to change some of the assumptions used in the corporation s allowance for loan losses methodology by shortening the historical period used for estimating loss migration factors which had the effect of more heavily weighting recent loss history in the portfolio 
the corporation strengthened the allowance for loan losses by providing an additional million above the quarter s charge offs for the first quarter of the allowance for unfunded lending commitments at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the allowance for credit losses  which includes both the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded lending commitments  amounted to million at year end  million at year end and million at year end allowance for credit losses for the year ended december  in thousands allowance for loan losses  beginning of period net charge offs allowance related to loans held for sale provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses  end of period reserve for unfunded lending commitments  beginning of period provision for credit losses reserve for unfunded lending commitments  end of period allowance for credit losses the following tables display the components of the allowance for loan losses at december  and at december  loan type allowance for loan commercial commercial installment home equity credit card res mortgage losses components loans r e loans leases loans loans loans loans total in thousands individually impaired loan component loan balance allowance collective loan impaired components credit risk graded loans grade loan balance grade allowance grade loan balance grade allowance grade loan balance grade allowance grade loan balance grade allowance grade special mention loan balance grade allowance grade substandard loan balance grade allowance grade doubtful loan balance grade allowance consumer loans based on payment status current loan balances current loan allowance days past due loan balance days past due loan allowance days past due loan balance days past due loan allowance days past due loan balance days past due loan allowance total loans total allowance for loan losses at december  loan type commercial commercial r e installment home equity credit card res mortgage allowance for loan losses components loans loans leases loans loans loans loans total in thousands individually impaired loan component loan balance allowance collective loan impairment components credit risk graded loans grade loan balance grade allowance grade loan balance grade allowance grade loan balance grade allowance grade loan balance grade allowance grade special mention loan balance grade allowance grade substandard loan balance grade allowance grade doubtful loan balance grade allowance consumer loans based on payment status current loan balances current loans allowance days past due loan balance days past due allowance days past due loan balance days past due allowance days past due loan balance days past due allowance total loans total allowance for loan losses a five year summary of activity follows years ended december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses at january  loans charged off commercial mortgage installment home equity credit cards manufactured housing leases total recoveries commercial mortgage installment home equity credit cards manufactured housing leases total net charge offs allowance related to loans held for sale sold reclassification to lease residual reserve provision for loan losses allowance for loan losses at december  average loans outstanding ratio to average loans net charge offs net charge offs and allowance related to loans held for sale sold provision for loan losses loans outstanding at end of year allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans outstanding at end of year as a multiple of net charge offs as a multiple of net charge offs and allowance related to loans sold asset quality making a loan to earn an interest spread inherently includes taking the risk of not being repaid 
successful management of credit risk requires making good underwriting decisions  carefully administering the loan portfolio and diligently collecting delinquent accounts 
the corporation s credit policy division manages credit risk by establishing common credit policies for its subsidiaries  participating in approval of their largest loans  conducting reviews of their loan portfolios  providing them with centralized consumer underwriting  collections and loan operations services  and overseeing their loan workouts 
notes  and to the consolidated financial statements  provide detailed information regarding the corporation s credit policies and practices 
the corporation s objective is to minimize losses from its commercial lending activities and to maintain consumer losses at acceptable levels that are stable and consistent with growth and profitability objectives 
nonperforming loans are defined as follows nonaccrual loans on which interest is no longer accrued because its collection is doubtful 
restructured loans on which  due to deterioration in the borrower s financial condition  the original terms have been modified in favor of the borrower or either principal or interest has been forgiven

during january  additional information on one criticized commercial relationship led the corporation to conclude that the borrower s financial condition was significantly worse than what previously had been represented to firstmerit bank as of december  based upon this analysis  the corporation down graded this relationship to substandard nonaccrual and the estimated loss related to this commercial relationship is fully reflected 
in the second quarter of  the corporation sold million of nonperforming loans

had they been paid in accordance with the payment terms in force prior to being considered impaired  on nonaccrual status  or restructured  they would have earned million for both years in interest income 
in addition to nonperforming loans and loans day past due and still accruing interest  management identified potential problem commercial loans classified as substandard and doubtful totaling million at year end and million at year end these loans are closely monitored for any further deterioration in the borrowers financial condition and for the borrowers ability to comply with terms of the loans

the following table summarizes cds in amounts of thousand or more as of year end  by time remaining until maturity 
time until maturity amount in thousands under months to months to months over months interest rate sensitivity interest rate sensitivity measures the potential exposure of earnings and capital to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation has a policy that provides guidelines in the management of interest rate risk 
this policy is reviewed periodically to ensure it complies with trends in the financial markets and the industry 
the following analysis divides interest bearing assets and liabilities into maturity categories and measures the gap between maturing assets and liabilities in each category 
the corporation analyzes the historical sensitivity of its interest bearing transaction accounts to determine the portion that it classifies as interest rate sensitive versus the portion classified over one year 
the analysis shows that liabilities maturing within one year exceed assets maturing within the same period by million 
the corporation uses the gap analysis and other tools to monitor rate risk 
focusing on estimated repricing activity within one year  the corporation was in a liability sensitive position at december  as illustrated in the following table 
over days days days days days year total in thousands interest earning assets loans and leases investment securities and federal funds sold total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand interest bearing savings and money market accounts certificate and other time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase wholesale borrowings total interest bearing liabilities total gap cumulative gap market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices and commodity prices  including the correlation among these factors and their volatility 
the corporation is primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to its customers 
changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the corporation s financial instruments  cash flows  and net interest income 
the corporation seeks to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates 
the asset and liability committee alco oversees market risk management  establishing risk measures  limits  and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate risk and its effect on net interest income and capital 
according to these policies  responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides in the corporate treasury function 
interest rate risk on the corporation s balance sheets consists of reprice  option  and basis risks 
reprice risk results from differences in the maturity  or repricing  of asset and liability portfolios 
option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options  deposit early withdrawal options  and interest rate options 
these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change  which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for the corporation 
basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices  which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability 
basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities  such as interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates 
the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools  including earnings simulation modeling and economic value of equity sensitivity analysis  which capture both near term and long term interest rate risk exposures 
combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of short term and long term interest rate risk in the corporation 
earnings simulation involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  and spreads between market interest rates 
the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks  gradual ramps  curve flattening  curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios 
presented below is the corporation s interest rate risk profile as of december  immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in net interest income basis basis basis basis points points points points december  december  modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process 
to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed  actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected 
the assumptions used in the models are management s best estimate based on studies conducted by the alco department 
the alco department uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various ad hoc reports to refine assumptions continuously 
assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg  savings  money market and interest bearing checking accounts  balance trends  and repricing relationships reflect management s best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly 
the corporation also has longer term interest rate risk exposure  which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis 
alco uses economic value of equity eve sensitivity analysis to study the impact of long term cash flows on earnings and capital 
eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on balance sheet and off balance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios 
the discounted present value of all cash flows represents the corporation s economic value of equity 
the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario  which will impact the discounted present value 
the amount of base case measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow management to measure longer term repricing and option risk in the balance sheet 
presented below is the corporation s eve profile as of december  and immediate change in rates and resulting percentage increase decrease in eve basis basis basis basis points points points points december  december  during the year ended december   million excluding security valuation adjustments of maturing investment portfolio cash flows were not reinvested 
the net additional funds were used to fund loan growth and reduce the dependency on deposit growth 
this was part of the overall balance sheet remix strategy employed by the corporation to shift earning assets into higher yielding instruments 
the duration of the portfolio is as of december  as compared to on december  capital resources financial institutions are subject to a strict uniform system of capital based regulations 
under this system  there are five different categories of capitalization  with prompt corrective actions and significant operational restrictions imposed on institutions that are capital deficient under the categories 
the five categories are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a leverage capital ratio of  and must not be subject to any order or directive requiring the institution to improve its capital level 
an adequately capitalized institution has a total risk based capital ratio of at least  a tier i capital ratio of at least and a leverage capital ratio of at least 
institutions with lower capital levels are deemed to be undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized  depending on their actual capital levels

liquidity risk management liquidity risk is the possibility of the corporation being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner 
liquidity is managed to ensure stable  reliable and cost effective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit  deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities 
the corporation considers core earnings  strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings  which allow the corporation cost effective access to market based liquidity 
the corporation relies on a large  stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk 
the corporation s treasury group is responsible for identifying  measuring and monitoring the corporation s liquidity profile 
the position is evaluated daily  weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources  reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future month and identifying sources and uses of funds 
treasury group also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institution specific stress 
in addition  the overall management of the corporation s liquidity position is integrated into retail deposit pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base 
the corporation s primary source of liquidity is its core deposit base  raised through its retail branch system 
the corporation also has available unused wholesale sources of liquidity  including advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati  borrowings through the discount window of the federal reserve bank of cleveland  debt issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers 
liquidity is also provided by unencumbered  or un pledged  investment securities that totaled million at december  funding trends for the year for the year ended december   lower cost core deposits decreased by million 
in aggregate  total deposits increased million reflecting a shift in customer preferences for time deposit accounts with higher yields 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase decreased by million from the end of to year end the corporation s loan to deposit ratio decreased to at december  compared to at december  parent company liquidity firstmerit corporation manages its liquidity principally through dividends from the bank subsidiary 
during  firstmerit bank paid firstmerit corporation a total of million in dividends 
as of year end  firstmerit bank had an additional million available to pay dividends without regulatory approval 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the corporation has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
the following table summarizes the corporation s significant obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the table the following table details the amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments and off balance sheet arrangements as of december  additionally details of these commitments are provided in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements  as referenced in the following table contractual obligations payments due in note one year one to three to over five reference total or less three years five years years in thousands deposits without a stated maturity a consumer and brokered certificates of deposits a federal funds borrowed and security repurchase agreements long term debt capital lease obligations c operating leases b purchase obligations c total a excludes interest

e the postretirement benefit payments represent actuarilly determined future benefits to eligible plan participants 
sfas requires that the liability be recorded at net present value while the future payments contained in this table have not been discounted 
effects of inflation the assets and liabilities of the corporation are primarily monetary in nature and are more directly affected by the fluctuation in interest rates than inflation 
movement in interest rates is a result of the perceived changes in inflation as well as monetary and fiscal policies 
interest rates and inflation do not move with the same velocity or within the same time frame  therefore  a direct relationship to the inflation rate cannot be shown 
the financial information presented in this report  based on historical data  has a direct correlation to the influence of market levels of interest rates 
therefore  management believes that there is no material benefit in presenting a statement of financial data adjusted for inflationary changes 
critical accounting policies the corporation s most significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
management has determined that accounting for the allowance for loan losses  income taxes  and mortgage servicing rights  derivative instruments and hedging activities  and pension and postretirement benefits are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments 
application of assumptions different than those used by management could result in material changes in the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
accounting for these critical areas requires the most subjective and complex judgments that could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
as explained in note summary of significant accounting policies and note allowance for loan losses to these consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogenous pools of loans 
management s estimate of the allowance for the commercial portfolio could be affected by risk rating upgrades or downgrades as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual credit due to factors particular to that credit such as competition  management or business performance 
a reasonably possible scenario would be an estimated migration of lower risk related pass credits to criticized status which could increase the inherent losses by million 
a reduction in the level of criticized credits is also possible  which would result in an estimated million lower inherent loss 
for the consumer portfolio  where individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools  losses can be affected by such things as collateral value  loss severity  the economy  and other uncontrollable factors 
the consumer portfolio is largely comprised of loans that are secured by primary residences and home equity lines and loans 
a basis point increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on the residential mortgage and home equity line and loan portfolios would change the inherent losses by million 
the remaining consumer portfolio inherent loss analysis includes reasonably possible scenarios with estimated loss rates increasing or decreasing by basis points  which would change the related inherent losses by million 
additionally the estimate of the allowance for loan losses for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions as evidenced by changes in interest rates  unemployment rates  bankruptcy filings  used car prices and real estate values 
while no one factor is dominant  each has the ability to result in actual loan losses which differ from originally estimated amounts 
the information presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 
the income tax amounts in note federal income taxes to these consolidated financial statements reflect the current period income tax expense for all periods shown  as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
the calculation of the corporation s income tax provision is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments in its determination 
the current income tax liability also includes management s estimate of potential adjustments by taxing authorities 
changes to the corporation s estimated accrued taxes can occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  implementation of new business strategies  resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
these changes  when they occur  affect accrued taxes and can be material to the corporation s operating results for any particular reporting period 
the potential impact to the corporation s operating results for any of the changes cannot be reasonably estimated 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights is more fully discussed in note and note mortgage servicing rights and mortgage servicing activity to these consolidated financial statements and is another area heavily dependent on current economic conditions  especially the interest rate environment  and management s estimates 
the corporation uses discounted cash flow modeling techniques in determining this asset s value 
the modeled results utilize estimates about the amount and timing of mortgage loan repayments  estimated prepayment rates  credit loss experiences  costs to service the loans and discount rates to consider the risks involved in the estimation process 
a sensitivity analysis is presented in note derivative instruments and hedging activities are more fully described in note  note fair value disclosures of financial instruments  and note financial instruments with off balance sheet risk to these consolidated financial statements 
during and  the corporation had fair value hedges recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities as applicable 
certain assumptions and forecasts related to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of the derivative and the time being hedged must be documented at the inception of the hedging relationship to demonstrate that the derivative instrument will be effective in hedging the designated risk 
if these assumptions or forecasts do not accurately reflect subsequent changes in the fair market value of the derivative instrument or the designated item being hedged  the corporation might be required to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for that derivative instrument 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all subsequent changes in the fair market value of the derivative instrument must flow through the consolidated statement of earnings in other noninterest income  possibly resulting in greater volatility in the corporation s earnings 
if the corporation did not apply hedge accounting  the impact in would have been to lower pre tax earnings by approximately million 
accounting for pensions is an area that requires management to make various assumptions to appropriately value any pension asset or liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheet as other assets or other liabilities 
these assumptions include the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of compensation increase 
changes in these assumptions could impact earnings and would be reflected in noninterest expense as salaries and employee benefits in the consolidated statements of earnings 
for example  a lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets could negatively impact earnings as would a lower estimated discount rate or a higher rate of compensation increase 
the corporation uses the moody s aa corporate bond rate as the high quality fixed income investment basis for establishing the discount rate and regularly monitors the duration of its benefit liabilities versus the duration of the bonds in the moody s aa portfolio 
during the corporation changed one of the assumptions used in the pension liability assumption 
the discount rate was reduced by basis points to to reflect the interest rate environment 
the corporation used an assumed return on assets of for both and the rate of compensation increase was in  and to illustrate the sensitivity of earning to changes in the corporation s pension plan assumptions  a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased expense by million  while a basis point decrease in the discount rate would have increased expense by million 
additionally  a basis point increase in the long term rate of return would have decreased expense by million while a basis point decrease in the long term rate of return would have decreased expense by million
