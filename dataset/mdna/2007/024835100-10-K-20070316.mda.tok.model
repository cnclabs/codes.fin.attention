as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts or nareit  funds from operations or ffo represents income loss before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay distributions 
when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to make certain adjustments related to our on campus participating properties 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations funds from operations in item contained herein 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company and our business overview we are one of the largest owners  managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the united states in terms of beds owned and under management 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit with expertise in the acquisition  design  financing  development  construction management  leasing and management of student housing properties 
on march   we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of student housing properties the royal portfolio pursuant to a contribution and sale agreement with contributors affiliated with royal properties for a contribution value of million  which was paid as follows i the issuance to certain partners of the contributors of approximately million common units valued at per unit and approximately million series a preferred units valued at per unit see note  ii the assumption of million of fixed rate mortgage debt see note  and iii the remainder in cash and promissory notes 
as of december   as anticipated  the company has incurred an additional million in closing costs and other external acquisition costs related to this acquisition 
we retained approximately million of the contribution value  which will be utilized to satisfy indemnification obligations that may arise during a one year survival period  with any remaining amounts to be paid to the contributors upon expiration of such one year survival period 
the retained amount is composed of common units  series a preferred units  cash  and secured promissory notes of approximately million  payable on february  together with accrued interest at per annum 
the royal portfolio consists of five properties in florida  four properties in texas  two properties in tennessee  and one property each in arizona and kentucky 
the properties contain approximately  units and approximately  beds 
as of december   we were also under contract to acquire a million property in waco  texas 
the closing of this transaction was dependent upon completion of construction and lease up and the achievement of certain occupancy levels and rental rates  which were not met and the contract was terminated in property portfolio as of december   our total property portfolio contained student housing properties with approximately  beds and  apartment units  all of which we manage 
these communities contain modern housing units  offer resort style amenities and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student oriented programming 
our property portfolio includes owned properties that are in close proximities to colleges and universities in states  two of which are currently under construction 
the net operating income of these student housing communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels and is affected by our ability to control operating costs 
our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired student housing communities 
we create long term stockholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire student housing communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable 
additionally  we participate with two university systems in the ownership of four on campus properties under long term ground facility leases  we refer to these properties as our on campus participating properties 
third party development and management services we also provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities  c foundations and others 
our clients have included some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the state university of new york system  the university of california system  the university of houston system  the texas a m university system  the texas state university system  the university of georgia system  the university of north carolina system  the purdue university system  the university of colorado system  and the west virginia university system 
we have developed student housing properties for these clients and a majority of the time have been retained to manage these properties following their opening 
since  we have developed and assisted in securing financing for third party student housing properties  including four projects with scheduled completion dates ranging between august and july as of december   we were under contract on four projects that are currently in progress and whose fees range from million to million 
as of december   fees of approximately million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects  which have scheduled completion dates of august through july we also provide third party management and leasing services for student housing properties that represent approximately  beds in approximately  units  nine of which we developed 
our third party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to multi year management contracts that have an initial term that ranges from one to five years 
as of december   our total owned and managed portfolio included properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units 
we believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities present an attractive long term investment opportunity for our investors 
we intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated  typically highly amenitized  student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and or are under serviced in terms of existing on and or off campus student housing 
while fee revenue from our third party development  construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities  this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our owned property portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify  close  and successfully operate student housing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development and management services costs associated with the pursuit of third party development and management service contracts are expensed as incurred until such time as we have been notified of a contract award or otherwise believe that it is probable a contract will be awarded 
at such time  the reimbursable portion of such costs are recorded as receivables with the remaining portion deferred and expensed in relation to the revenues earned on such contracts 
development revenues are generally recognized based on a proportionate performance method based on contract deliverables  while construction revenues are recognized and related costs including the costs of our construction personnel involved in the project are deferred and expensed using the percentage of completion method as determined by construction costs incurred relative to the total estimated construction costs 
fees received in excess of those recognized are reflected as deferred revenue  which is included in other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenues recognized in excess of amounts received are included in other assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
third party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts  revenues or a fixed monthly amount  in accordance with the applicable management contract 
incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria are anticipated to be met 
student housing rental revenue recognition and accounts receivable student housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
in estimating the collectibility of our accounts receivable  we analyze the aging of resident receivables  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income 
allocation of fair value to acquired properties the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes  among other items  determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  in place tenant leases  and any debt assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated and combined financial statements contained in item herein 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases generally less than one year 
long lived assets impairment on a periodic basis  management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income 
outperformance bonus plan vesting of stock based awards under our outperformance bonus plan discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements contained in item herein will occur on the third anniversary of our ipo  provided that the employees have maintained continued service and that at least one performance measure  as outlined in our incentive award plan  has been achieved 
management s assessment of the probability of the achievement of the required performance measures is a highly judgmental determination that is based on the facts and circumstances existing at the date of the financial statements as well as management s expectations of our and our peer group s future performance 
as of december   nothing has been reflected in our financial statements related to these awards  because management has determined that the achievement of the required performance measures is not probable 
in the event that in a future period management determines that one of the required performance measures becomes probable  a charge to compensation expense will be recognized based on a proportionate amount of the total fair value of the awards from the date the award is considered probable to the ultimate settlement date 
the total potential charge to compensation expense  should management determine that the vesting of the awards becomes probable  could be in excess of million 
construction property savings and fire proceeds an entity formed by our predecessor owners was entitled to any savings in the budgeted completion cost of three of our owned off campus construction properties that were completed in fall in february  our predecessor owners received such funds 
additionally  in april  our predecessor owners received insurance proceeds originally received by the company in connection with the fire that occurred at the university village at fresno in these payments were accounted for as equity distributions 
capital expenditures we distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property 
acquisition related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets 
the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as the funds are not available to us for current use 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods 
year ended december  change change revenues owned off campus properties on campus participating properties third party development services third party management services resident services total revenues operating expenses owned off campus properties on campus participating properties third party development and management services general and administrative depreciation and amortization ground facility lease total operating expenses operating income nonoperating income and expenses interest income interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs other nonoperating income total nonoperating expenses income before income taxes  minority interests  and discontinued operations income tax provision minority interests income from continuing operations discontinued operations income attributable to discontinued operations gain from disposition of real estate total discontinued operations net income owned off campus properties operations revenues and operating expenses from our owned off campus properties increased by million and million  respectively  in as compared to these increases were primarily due to the acquisition of the royal portfolio on march  and the completion of construction and opening of university village at sweet home in august and callaway villas in august the village on university was sold in december and is therefore not reflected in operating revenues and expenses but is included in discontinued operations 
new property operations 
on march   we acquired the royal portfolio  which consists of properties containing  beds located in florida  texas  tennessee  arizona and kentucky 
in addition  in august we completed construction of and opened an bed property serving the state university of new york buffalo and in august we completed construction of and opened a bed property serving texas a m university 
these new properties contributed million of additional revenues and million of additional operating expenses in as compared to same store property operations excluding new property activity 
we had ten properties containing  beds which were operating during both and these properties produced revenues of million and million during and  respectively  an increase of million 
excluding resident services revenues  which are provided through our trs subsequent to our ipo  these properties produced revenues of million during  as compared to million in  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average rental rates during as compared to  as well as the improved lease up for the academic year  which resulted in average occupancy rates increasing to in from in revenues in will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the academic year at our various properties during our leasing period  which typically begins in january and ends in august 
at these existing properties  operating expenses remained relatively constant at million for both and we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in insurance costs  utility costs  property taxes and general inflation 
on campus participating properties ocpp operations new property operations 
in august  we completed construction of and opened an additional phase of our cullen oaks property  consisting of units and beds 
this additional phase contributed approximately million of additional revenues and approximately million of additional operating expenses during same store ocpp operations 
we had four on campus participating properties containing  beds which were operating during both and revenues from our same store on campus participating properties increased to million in from million in  an increase of million 
this increase was due to increased rental rates  which were offset by a decrease in average occupancy from in to in at these existing properties  operating expenses remained relatively constant at million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of expected increases in utility costs  insurance costs and general inflation 
third party development services revenue third party development services revenue was approximately million in both and development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects  the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project 
in addition  to the extent projects are completed under budget  we may be entitled to a portion of such savings  which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
it is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs 
the pre development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then current period 
third party management services revenue third party management services revenues decreased by million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of the discontinuation of the texas state university system management contracts in july  which was slightly offset by the commencement of four management contracts in august we anticipate that third party management services revenues in will increase slightly as compared with  as a result of the four management contracts obtained in august and anticipated new contracts in third party development and management services expenses third party development and management services expenses decreased approximately million  from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of approximately million in expenses incurred during as compared to in relation to the west virginia university third party development projects  a result of the progress of those projects during the respective years 
additionally  a reserve of approximately million was recorded in related to our blinn college development project which was not awarded as anticipated 
third party development and management services expenses in will be dependent on the level of awards we pursue  and as previously mentioned  any pre development costs charged against income for projects which did not close 
resident services resident services revenue represents revenue earned by our trs related to the provision of certain services to residents at our properties  such as food service  housekeeping  and resident programming activities 
these services are provided to the residents at market rates and under an agreement between the trs and the operating partnership  payments from residents are collected by the properties on behalf of the trs in conjunction with their collection of rents 
revenue from resident services increased approximately million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to additional revenue earned during from the acquired properties discussed above and the completion of construction and opening of university village at sweet home in august and callaway villas in august as a business strategy  our level of services provided to residents by the trs is only incidental to that which is necessary to maintain or increase occupancy 
we anticipate that resident services revenue will increase in as compared to as additional revenues are generated from the timing of acquisitions and development properties placed into service 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses relating primarily to corporate operations decreased approximately million from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a million compensation charge recorded in april to reflect a separation agreement entered into with a former executive officer 
in addition  the level of cash incentive awards decreased in as compared to  which was offset by an increase in payroll and other related costs as a result of overall increases in corporate staffing levels due to recent growth in our owned portfolio from the property acquisitions completed in and as a result of this growth  we anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase substantially in as a result of the annualization of these costs as well as increases in general inflation 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased approximately million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisition of the royal portfolio on march   the acquisition of seven properties during  the opening of one owned off campus property in august and one owned off campus property in august  and the completion of an additional phase at an on campus participating property in august in conjunction with the acquisition of the property royal portfolio on march  and the seven properties acquired during the first quarter of  a valuation was assigned to in place leases which was amortized over the remaining lease terms of the acquired leases generally less than one year 
this contributed million and million of additional depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
we expect depreciation and amortization in to increase significantly from primarily due to a full year s depreciation on properties acquired and placed in service during and the million of recently completed acquisitions 
amortization of deferred financing costs increased million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to debt assumed in connection with the previously mentioned royal portfolio acquisition and additional finance costs incurred in june related to an amendment to our revolving credit facility 
this increase was slightly offset by a decrease related to the august amendment to our revolving credit facility  which extended the term of the facility through august we expect amortization of deferred financing costs in to remain fairly constant as compared to due to a full year s amortization of debt assumed in connection with acquisitions made during and the debt assumed in connection with the million of recently completed acquisitions  which will be offset by a reduction in amortization on the revolving credit facility as a result of the previously mentioned august amendment 
interest income interest income increased by approximately million  from million in to million in this increase is primarily due to additional interest earned in on the remaining proceeds from our september equity offering and net proceeds from the sale of our owned off campus property in december  which was invested in money market investments during the year 
in addition  higher interest rates in resulted in more interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 
interest expense interest expense increased approximately million  from in to million in this increase was primarily due to million of additional interest incurred in associated with debt assumed in connection with the previously mentioned and acquisitions  net of the amortization of debt premiums and discounts recorded to reflect the market value of debt assumed 
in addition  we incurred additional interest expense on our revolving credit facility as a result of an increase in the weighted average balance from million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and an increase in the weighted average interest rate incurred under the revolving credit facility from to for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we also incurred additional interest in related to the construction loans incurred to fund the additional phase at an on campus participating property that opened in august these increases were offset by an increase in capitalized interest as a result of two owned off campus properties being under construction during as compared to one owned off campus property being under construction for the same period in we anticipate that interest expense in will increase from levels due to interest expense assumed or incurred in connection with property acquisitions and increases in potential borrowing rates that may impact our floating rate on our credit facility 
other nonoperating income other non operating income for includes a gain of approximately million related to the sale of our option to acquire a interest in dobie center  an off campus student housing property held by an affiliate of our predecessor owners 
in addition  we also recognized a gain of approximately million in related to insurance proceeds received for a fire that occurred at one of our owned off campus properties in income taxes subsequent to our ipo formation transactions  our trs manages our non reit activities 
the trs is subject to federal  state and local income taxes and is required to recognize the future tax benefits attributable to deductible temporary differences between book and tax basis  to the extent that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  an initial income tax benefit of million was recorded in connection with our ipo during an income tax provision of approximately million and  was recorded by our trs during and  respectively  to better reflect our estimate of the realization of our deferred tax asset based on management s estimate of future taxable income of our trs 
we are subject to federal  state and local income taxes as a result of the services provided by our trs  which include our third party services revenues  resident services revenues and the operations of our on campus participating properties 
as a result  the income earned by our trs  unlike our results from our owned properties  is subject to taxation 
the amount of income taxes to be recognized is dependent on the operating results of the trs 
minority interests minority interests increased by approximately million from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to the issuance of common units and series a preferred units in our operating partnership on march  in connection with our acquisition of the royal portfolio 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated and combined financial statements contained in item herein for a detailed description of minority interests

at these existing properties  operating expenses remained constant at million for both and third party development services revenue third party development services revenue increased by million from million in as compared to million in the increase in our third party development revenue was primarily due to a slightly higher average contractual fee per project and a higher percentage of the contractual fees recognized during as compared to these factors were offset by fewer projects in progress and a decrease in construction savings revenue earned during we had eight projects in progress during with an average contractual fee of approximately million compared to in which we had projects in progress with an average contractual fee of million 
also  due to differences in the percentage of construction completed during the periods  of the total contractual fees of the projects in progress during the respective periods  approximately of the total contractual fees were recognized during compared to approximately for in addition  our third party development revenue decreased as a result of approximately million of construction savings revenue that was recognized during no construction savings revenue was earned on our third party development projects during development services revenue earned in relation to our on campus participating properties is recognized over the term of the underlying ground leases 
approximately million of deferred development and construction revenue was recognized in upon the transfer of one of our on campus participating properties coyote village to weatherford college in april third party management services revenues third party management services revenue increased million from million in as compared to million in the increase was due to a full academic year of revenues earned related to seven new management contracts that commenced in fall third party development and management services expenses third party development and management services operating expenses increased approximately million  from million in  to million in this increase was primarily due to expenses incurred during in relation to three west virginia university fixed price projects that were in progress during which contributed million to the increase and a reserve of approximately million of development costs associated with our blinn college development project which was not awarded as anticipated 
resident services concurrent with our commencement of operations and our designation as a reit in  certain services previously provided to residents by our properties are now provided by our trs 
revenue from resident services increased by million in as compared to this increase is due to reflecting only approximately months of resident services revenue  which was classified as such beginning with our ipo and concurrent formation of our trs on august  accordingly  resident services revenue for reflects a full year of revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses relating primarily to corporate operations increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to the following items i additional expenses of million incurred in related to sarbanes oxley section compliance costs  ii a compensation charge of approximately million to reflect a separation agreement entered into with an executive officer in april  iii a full year of expenses incurred as a public company during  iv general increases in corporate staffing as a result of the growth experienced by the company in  and v normal inflationary increases in such items as payroll costs  benefits  and other related corporate items

approximately six months of interest was recognized under our revolving credit facility in as a result of the facility being fully paid down in july in connection with our equity offering 
this is in comparison to only approximately months of interest recognized under our revolving credit facility in due to the facility being obtained in connection with the ipo in august these increases were offset by a million increase of capitalized interest in as compared to as a result of increased activity related to the construction of our owned off campus properties 
the retirement of a million mortgage loan in connection with our ipo resulted in an additional decrease in interest expense of approximately million 
other nonoperating income other non operating income for includes a gain of approximately million related to the sale of our option to acquire a interest in dobie center  an off campus student housing property held by an affiliate of our predecessor owners

the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily the result of our equity offering in september which raised million  net of offering costs  as compared to the million  net of offering costs  raised in our july equity offering 
in addition  during we paid down million  net of draws  on our revolving credit facility 
during we received million of construction loan proceeds  which were used to fund the construction of two of our owned development properties  as compared to million of construction loan proceeds received during to fund the development of an additional phase at an on campus participating property 
these increases were offset by the receipt of proceeds from a million bridge loan during and the million pay down of a construction loan with proceeds from our september equity offering

the increase in cash utilized in investing activities during the year ended december  related primarily to the use of cash to acquire seven properties in the first quarter of and to fund the development of an additional phase of an on campus participating property  which was completed in fall this increase in cash utilized was offset by proceeds received from the sale of university village at san bernardino in january as well as a decrease in cash used to fund owned off campus development properties 
during the year ended december   three owned off campus properties were under development  of which one was completed in fall  while four properties were under development during the year ended december   of which three were completed in fall financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended december  consisted primarily of proceeds received from our equity offering  net of offering costs  of approximately million in july other significant financing activities occurring during the year ended december  included the receipt of proceeds from a bridge loan subsequently converted to a mortgage loan in the amount of million and draws on a construction loan used to fund the development of an additional phase of an on campus participating property in the amount of approximately million 
these items were offset by the use of cash to fund distributions to our common and restricted stockholders in the amount of approximately million as well as the use of cash to pay down our revolving credit net of draws on the facility during the period in the amount of approximately million

also  a million partial quarter distribution for the third quarter was paid in november structure of on campus participating properties at our on campus participating properties  the subject universities own both the land and improvements 
we then have a leasehold interest under a ground facility lease 
under the lease  we receive an annual distribution representing of these properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses which includes our management fees  debt service which includes repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
we also manage these properties under multi year management agreements and are paid a management fee representing of receipts 
we do not have access to the cash flows and working capital of these participating properties except for the annual net cash distribution as described above 
additionally  a substantial portion of these properties cash flow is dedicated to capital reserves required under the applicable property indebtedness and to the amortization of such indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties since our interest  including our right to share in the net cash available for distribution from the properties  terminates upon the amortization of their indebtedness 
our economic interest in these properties is therefore limited to our interest in the net cash flow and management and development fees from these properties  as reflected in our calculation of funds from operations modified for the operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom contained herein 
accordingly  when considering these properties contribution to our operations  we focus upon our share of these properties net cash available for distribution and the management fees that we receive from these properties  rather than upon their contribution to our gross revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes

liquidity and capital resources cash balances and liquidity as of december   excluding our on campus participating properties  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december  this increase was primarily due to the completion of our equity offering in september  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  as well as the recent disposition of an owned off campus property  the village on university  which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we used million of the equity offering proceeds to pay off the balance on our revolving credit facility 
an additional million of the equity offering proceeds was used to pay off the construction loan for callaway villas  our recently completed owned off campus property 
restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits  as required by law in certain states

we may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
while we believe we will be able to obtain such funds  these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our revolving credit facility 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
equity offering on september   we completed an equity offering  consisting of the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  including the  shares issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in full at closing

revolving credit facility on august   the operating partnership amended and restated its million revolving credit facility to increase the size of the facility to million  which may be expanded by up to an additional million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the maturity date was extended two years to august  and we continue to guarantee the operating partnership s obligations under the facility 
availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to an aggregate borrowing base amount equal to the lesser of i of the value of certain properties  calculated as set forth in the credit facility  and ii the adjusted net operating income from these properties divided by a formula amount 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate  at the company s option  based upon a base rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus  in each case  a spread based upon the company s total leverage 
additionally  the company is required to pay an unused commitment fee ranging from to per annum  depending on the aggregate unused balance 
in september  we paid off the entire balance on the revolving credit facility using proceeds from our september equity offering 
as of december   the total availability under the facility subject to the satisfaction of certain financial covenants totaled approximately million 
the terms of the facility include certain restrictions and covenants  which limit  among other items  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  and the disposition of assets 
the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain minimum ratios of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges 
we may not pay distributions that exceed of funds from operations for any four consecutive quarters 
the financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
accordingly  we intend to make  but are not contractually bound to make  regular quarterly distributions to common stockholders and unit holders 
distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
we may be required to use borrowings under the credit facility  if necessary  to meet reit distribution requirements and maintain our reit status 
the board of directors considers market factors and our company s performance in addition to reit requirements in determining distribution levels

recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general capital expenditures and improvements 
our policy is to capitalize costs related to the acquisition  development  rehabilitation  construction  and improvement of properties  including interest and certain internal personnel costs related to the communities under rehabilitation and construction 
capital improvements are costs that increase the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
ordinary repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
recurring capital expenditures represent non incremental building improvements required to maintain current revenues and typically include appliances  carpeting and flooring  hvac equipment  kitchen bath cabinets  new roofs  site improvements and various exterior building improvements 
non recurring capital expenditures include expenditures that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a property which were considered necessary to bring the property up to operating standard  and incremental improvements that include  among other items community centers  new windows  and kitchen bath apartment upgrades 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute amounts to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at their mortgaged properties 
these annual contributions may exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred in such year at such properties 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our owned off campus properties  excluding the village at riverside  which was distributed to our predecessor owners in connection with the ipo  are set forth below as of and for the year ended december  average beds total recurring capital expenditures average per bed pre development expenditures our third party and owned development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
the closing and or commencement of construction of these development projects is subject to a number of risks such as our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms and delays or refusals in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  and other required governmental permits and authorizations as such  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained 
accordingly  we bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
historically  our third party and owned development projects have been successfully structured and financed  however  these developments have at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled  causing revenue to be recognized in later periods 
as of december   we have deferred approximately million in pre development costs related to third party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction 
indebtedness as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness excluding net unamortized debt premiums  net of discounts  of approximately million  comprised of million in mortgage and construction loans secured by of our owned off campus properties  million in mortgage and construction loans secured by two phases of an on campus participating property  and million in bond issuances secured by three of our on campus participating properties 
the weighted average interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness as of december  was 
as of december   approximately of our total consolidated indebtedness was variable rate debt  comprised of our revolving credit facility  which had no outstanding balance as of december  and the university centre and cullen oaks phase ii construction loans discussed below 
owned off campus properties the weighted average interest rate of the million of owned off campus mortgage and construction debt was as of december  each of the mortgages is a non recourse obligation subject to customary exceptions 
each of these mortgages has a year amortization  and none are cross defaulted or cross collateralized to any other indebtedness 
the loans generally may not be prepaid prior to maturity  in certain cases prepayment is allowed  subject to prepayment penalties 
in connection with our september equity offering  we paid off the entire million balance of the construction loan for callaway villas  an owned off campus property which completed construction and opened for occupancy in august the development and construction of university centre  an owned property scheduled to open for occupancy in fall  is partially financed with a construction loan 
the loan amount is million and we began making draws on this loan in july for each borrowing  we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  or three month libor plus 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date of october  as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a rate of on campus participating properties three of our on campus participating properties are financed with million of outstanding project based taxable bonds 
under the terms of these financings  one of our special purpose subsidiaries publicly issued three series of taxable bonds and loaned the proceeds to three special purpose subsidiaries that each hold a separate leasehold interest 
although a default in payment by these special purpose subsidiaries could result in a default under one or more series of bonds  the indebtedness of any of these special purpose subsidiaries is not cross defaulted or cross collateralized with indebtedness of the company  the operating partnership or other special purpose subsidiaries 
repayment of principal and interest on these bonds is insured by mbia  inc the loans encumbering the leasehold interests are non recourse  subject to customary exceptions 
cullen oaks phase i is currently encumbered by a mortgage loan originated in september in the original principal amount of approximately million 
the loan bears interest at the prime rate  or libor plus  at our election with principal amortizing on a year schedule 
we have in place an interest rate swap agreement which effectively caps the interest on the outstanding balance as of december  of approximately million at 
the loan matures in november pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estate does not achieve financial break even defined as revenues less operating expenses  excluding management fees  less debt service  the applicable lessor would be required to make a rental payment  also known as the contingent payment  sufficient to achieve financial break even 
the contingent payment provision remains in effect until such time as any financing placed on the facilities would receive an investment grade rating without the contingent payment provision 
in the event that the lessor is required to make a contingent payment  future net cash flow distributions would be first applied to repay such contingent payments and then to unpaid management fees prior to normal distributions pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estates do not 
in turn  we have guaranteed payment of this property s indebtedness 
in addition  the construction of cullen oaks phase ii  which was completed in august  was financed by a construction loan 
the balance on this construction loan as of december  was approximately million  bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 
in june we extended the maturity date of this construction loan to november  the terms of the loan were modified to require monthly payments of principal and interest beginning in july the weighted average interest rate of the indebtedness encumbering our on campus participating properties was at december  subsequent to year end  we extended the maturity date of the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii loans to february the extended loans bear interest at a rate of libor plus and require payments of interest only through may and monthly payments of principal and interest from may through the maturity date 
in connection with these loan extensions  we terminated the existing interest rate swap agreement which will result in the reclassification of a gain from accumulated other comprehensive income to earnings  amounting to million in and million in in addition  we entered into an interest rate swap on february  effective february  through february  that is designated to hedge our exposure to fluctuations on interest payments attributed to changes in interest rates associated with payments on the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii loans 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate of libor plus 
off balance sheet items we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter long term debt operating leases capital leases owned development project third party development long term debt obligations reflect the payment of both principal and interest 
for long term obligations with a variable interest rate  the rate in effect at december  was assumed to remain constant over all periods presented 
includes minimum annual lease payments under the ground leases for university village at tu  university centre formerly village at newark and asu scrc 
consists of the completion costs related to asu scrc  which is scheduled to be completed in august the amounts do not include completion costs which are funded through the construction loan 
we have entered into a contract with a general contractor for certain phases of the construction of this project 
however  this contract does not generally cover all of the costs that are necessary to place the property into service  including the cost of furniture and marketing and leasing costs 
the unfunded commitments presented include all such costs  not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under the construction contract 
funds from operations as defined by nareit  ffo represents income loss before allocation to minority interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net income loss company predecessor year ended december  year ended december  period from august  to december  period from january  to august  net income loss minority interests gain loss from disposition of real estate real estate related depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization corporate furniture  fixtures  and equipment depreciation funds from operations ffo ffo per share basic ffo per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic diluted our ffo for the year ended december  was impacted by a series of charges totaling approximately million related to our ipo and related formation transactions 
the primary components of the charges include i piu grants of approximately million  ii rsu grants of million  and iii the write off of loan origination costs and exit fees associated with the repayment of indebtedness of approximately million 
these items were partially offset by the recognition of an initial deferred tax asset associated with the formation of our trs  resulting in an income tax benefit of million 
while our on campus participating properties contributed million  million and million to our revenues for the years ended december    and  respectively  under our participating ground leases  we and the participating university systems each receive of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness 
as noted above  ffo excludes gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets because these gaap items assume that the value of real estate diminishes over time 
however  unlike the ownership of our owned off campus properties  the unique features of our ownership interest in our on campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time 
for example  since the ground facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt  such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor 
accordingly  when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to modify ffo to exclude the operations of our on campus participating properties and to consider their impact on performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive  both of which increase and decrease with the operating measure of the properties  a measure referred to herein as ffom 
funds from operations modified for operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom company predecessor year ended december  year ended december  period from august  to december  period from january  to august  funds from operations elimination of operations of on campus participating properties net income loss from on campus participating properties amortization of investment in on campus participating properties modifications to reflect operational performance of on campus participating properties our share of net cash flow management fees on campus participating properties development fees impact of on campus participating properties funds from operations modified for operational performance of on campus participating properties ffom ffom per share basic ffom per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding basic diluted excludes the loss on the sale of an on campus participating property of  during the period from january  to august   which has been reflected in the calculation of ffo above 
of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
amounts represent actual cash received for the year to date periods and amounts accrued for the interim periods 
as a result of using accrual based results in interim periods and cash based results for year to date periods  the sum of reported interim results may not agree to annual cash received 
development and construction management fees  including construction savings earned under the general construction contract  related to the cullen oaks phase ii on campus participating property  which was completed in august this narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization 
we believe  however  that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long term profitability from its investment 
our ffom may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the unique contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on campus participating properties  which is different from that of our off campus owned properties 
additionally  ffom reflects features of our ownership interests in our on campus participating properties that are unique to us 
companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures  and therefore those companies may not calculate a ffom in the same manner that we do  or at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap and ffo results and using our modified ffo only supplementally 
inflation our leases do not typically provide for rent escalations 
however  they typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance acquisitions  developments and maturing debt 
these borrowings expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  and we had fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates basis points would cause a million and million decline in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would cause a million and million increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
due to the structure of our floating rate debt and interest rate protection instruments  the impact of a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on our net income to common stockholders and cash flows would not be significant at december  or all of our outstanding indebtedness is fixed rate except for our revolving credit facility and the cullen oaks phase ii and university centre construction loans 
our revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  in each case  a spread based on our total leverage 
the cullen oaks phase ii construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
the university centre construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or one  two  or three month libor plus  at our election 
we have in place an interest rate swap agreement  designated as a cash flow hedge  which effectively fixes the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the cullen oaks phase i mortgage loan at through maturity in we anticipate incurring additional variable rate indebtedness in the future  including draws under our million revolving credit facility 
we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
