item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation market risk 
further  our financial results from global operations may decrease if we fail to execute or improperly hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations 
our success depends upon the recruitment and retention of key personnel 
to remain competitive in our industries  we must attract  motivate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel  including executives  consultants  programmers and systems architects skilled in the healthcare information technology  healthcare devices  healthcare transactions and life sciences industries and the technical environments in which our solutions  devices and services operate 
competition for such personnel in our industries is intense 
our failure to attract additional qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our prospects for long term growth 
our 
table of contents success is dependent to a significant degree on the continued contributions of key management  sales  marketing  consulting and technical personnel 
we have succession plans in place  however  the unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact to our business and results of operations  and could potentially inhibit development and delivery of our solutions  devices and services and market share advances 
we significantly rely on third party suppliers 
we license or purchase intellectual property and technology such as software  hardware and content from third parties  including some competitors  and incorporate it into or sell it in conjunction with our solutions  devices and services  some of which are critical to the operation and delivery of our solutions  devices and services 
if any of the third party suppliers were to change product offerings  increase prices or terminate our licenses or supply contracts  we might need to seek alternative suppliers and incur additional internal or external development costs to ensure continued performance of our solutions  devices and services 
such alternatives may not be available on attractive terms  or may not be as widely accepted or as effective as the intellectual property or technology provided by our existing suppliers 
if the cost of licensing  purchasing or maintaining the third party intellectual property or technology significantly increases  our gross margin levels could significantly decrease 
in addition  interruption in functionality of our solutions  devices and services could adversely affect future sales of solutions  devices and services 
we intend to continue strategic business acquisitions which are subject to inherent risks 
in order to expand our solutions  device offerings and services and grow our market and client base  we may continue to seek and complete strategic business acquisitions that we believe are complementary to our business 
acquisitions have inherent risks which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or prospects  including  but not limited to failure to successfully integrate the business and financial operations  services  intellectual property  solutions or personnel of the acquired business  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  failure to achieve projected synergies and performance targets  loss of clients or key personnel of the acquired business  incurrence of debt and or assumption of known and unknown liabilities  write off of software development costs and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  and  dilutive issuances of equity securities 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses or fail to implement our business strategies with respect to these acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the amount of consideration paid for such acquired businesses 
risks related to the healthcare information technology  healthcare device and healthcare transaction industry the healthcare industry is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
for example  the balanced budget act of public law contained significant changes to medicare and medicaid and had an impact for several years on healthcare providers ability to invest in capital intensive systems 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa is having a direct impact on the healthcare industry by requiring identifiers and standardized transactions code sets and necessary security and privacy measures in order to ensure the protection of protected health information 
these regulatory factors affect the purchasing practices and operation of healthcare organizations 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level and to change healthcare financing and reimbursement systems 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants operate 
healthcare industry participants may respond by reducing their investments or postponing investment decisions  including investments in our software solutions and services 
many healthcare providers are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
these providers may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our software solutions and services 
as the healthcare industry consolidates  our client base could be eroded  competition for clients could become more intense and the importance of acquiring each client becomes greater 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated at the local  state and federal level 
we are subject to a significant and wide ranging number of regulations both within the united states and elsewhere  such as 
table of contents regulations in the areas of healthcare fraud  e prescribing  claims processing and transmission  medical devices and the security and privacy of patient data 
healthcare fraud 
federal and state governments continue to strengthen their positions and scrutiny over practices involving healthcare fraud affecting healthcare providers whose services are reimbursed by medicare  medicaid and other government healthcare programs 
healthcare providers who are our clients are subject to laws and regulations on fraud and abuse which  among other things  prohibit the direct or indirect payment or receipt of any remuneration for patient referrals  or arranging for or recommending referrals or other business paid for in whole or in part by these federal or state healthcare programs 
federal enforcement personnel have substantial funding  powers and remedies to pursue suspected or perceived fraud and abuse 
the effect of this government regulation on our clients is difficult to predict 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with any applicable laws  many of the regulations applicable to our clients and that may be applicable to us  are vague or indefinite and have not been interpreted by the courts 
they may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial  regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could broaden their applicability to us or require our clients to make changes in their operations or the way in which they deal with us 
if such laws and regulations are determined to be applicable to us and if we fail to comply with any applicable laws and regulations  we could be subject to sanctions or liability  including exclusion from government health programs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
e prescribing 
the use of our solutions by physicians for electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law 
states have differing prescription format requirements  which we have programmed into our software 
in addition  in november  the department of health and human services announced regulations by cms related to e prescribing and the prescription drug program e prescribing regulations 
these e prescribing regulations were mandated by the medicare prescription drug  improvement  and modernization act of the e prescribing regulations set forth standards for the transmission of electronic prescriptions 
the final regulations adopted two standards effective january a second and final set of required standards are to be published no later than april  and implemented no later than april  these standards are detailed and significant  and cover not only transactions between prescribers and dispensers for prescriptions but also electronic eligibility and benefits inquiries and drug formulary and benefit coverage information 
our efforts to provide solutions that enable our clients to comply with these regulations could be time consuming and expensive 
claims transmissions 
certain of our solutions assist our clients in submitting claims to payers  which claims are governed by federal and state laws 
our solutions are capable of electronically transmitting claims for services and items rendered by a physician to many patients payers for approval and reimbursement 
federal law provides civil liability to any person that knowingly submits a claim to a payer  including  for example  medicare  medicaid and private health plans  seeking payment for any services or items that have not been provided to the patient 
federal law may also impose criminal penalties for intentionally submitting such false claims 
we have policies and procedures in place that we believe result in the accurate and complete transmission of claims  provided that the information given to us by our clients is also accurate and complete 
the hipaa security  privacy and transaction standards  as discussed below  also have a potentially significant effect on our claims transmission services  since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our clients hipaa compliance obligations 
regulation of medical devices 
the united states food and drug administration the fda has declared that certain of our solutions are medical devices that are actively regulated under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act act and amendments to the act 
as a consequence  we are subject to extensive regulation by the fda with regard to those solutions that are actively regulated 
other countries have similar regulations in place related to medical devices  that now or may in the future apply to certain of our solutions 
if other of our solutions are deemed to be actively regulated medical devices by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in countries where we do business  we could be subject to extensive requirements governing pre and post marketing requirements including pre market notification clearance 
complying with these medical device regulations on a global perspective is time consuming and expensive 
further  it is possible that these regulatory agencies may become more active in regulating software that is used in healthcare 

table of contents there have been eight fda inspections since at various cerner sites 
inspections conducted at our world headquarters in and our prior houston facility in each resulted in the issuance of an fda form that we responded to promptly 
the fda has taken no further action with respect to either of the form s that were issued in and the remaining six fda inspections  including inspections at our world headquarters in  resulted in no issuance of a form we remain subject to periodic fda inspections and we could be required to undertake additional actions to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements 
our failure to comply with the act and any other applicable regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue to manufacture and distribute our solutions 
the fda has many enforcement tools including recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and or criminal prosecutions 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
security and privacy of patient information 
state and federal laws regulate the confidentiality of patient records and the circumstances under which those records may be released 
these regulations govern both the disclosure and use of confidential patient medical record information and require the users of such information to implement specified security measures 
regulations currently in place governing electronic health data transmissions continue to evolve and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
hipaa requires national standards for some types of electronic health information transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  security standards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of health information and standards to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
covered entities under hipaa  which include healthcare organizations such as our clients  were required to comply with the privacy standards by april  the transaction regulations by october and the security regulations by april as a business associate of the covered entities  we  in most instances  must also ensure compliance with the hipaa regulations as it pertains to our clients 
the effect of hipaa on our business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurances that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation  or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 
furthermore  we are unable to predict what changes to hipaa  or the regulations issued pursuant to hipaa  might be made in the future or how those changes could affect our business or the costs of compliance with hipaa 
evolving hipaa related laws or regulations could restrict the ability of our clients to obtain  use or disseminate patient information 
this could adversely affect demand for our solutions if they are not re designed in a timely manner in order to meet the requirements of any new regulations that seek to protect the privacy and security of patient data or enable our clients to execute new or modified healthcare transactions 
we may need to expend additional capital  research and development and other resources to modify our solutions and devices to address these evolving data security and privacy issues 
we operate in intensely competitive and dynamic industries  and our ability to successfully compete and continue to grow our business depends on our ability to respond quickly to market changes and changing technologies and to bring competitive new solutions  devices  features and services to market in a timely fashion 
the market for healthcare information systems  healthcare devices  healthcare transactions and life sciences consulting services are intensely competitive  dynamically evolving and subject to rapid technological and innovative changes 
development of new proprietary technology or services is complex  entails significant time and expense and may not be successful 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to introduce new solutions  devices or services on schedule  or at all  nor can we guarantee that  despite extensive testing  errors will not be found in our new solution releases  devices or services before or after commercial release  which could result in solution  device or service delivery redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  market acceptance 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the healthcare information market include the ease of implementation  the breadth and quality of system and software solution offerings  the stability of the information system provider  the ongoing support for the system and the potential for enhancements and future compatible software solutions 
certain of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than us and some of our competitors offer software solutions that we do not offer 
our principal existing competitors in the healthcare solutions and services market include eclipsys corporation  epic systems corporation  ge healthcare technologies  isoft corporation  mckesson corporation  medical information technology  inc meditech  misys healthcare systems and siemens medical solutions health services corporation  each of which offers a suite of 
table of contents software solutions that compete with many of our software solutions and services 
there are other competitors that offer a more limited number of competing software solutions and services  including  without limitation allscripts healthcare solutions  inc  emdeon corporation and quality systems  inc we view our principal competitors in the healthcare device market to include omnicell  inc  cardinal health  inc and mckesson corporation  and we view our principal competitors in the healthcare transactions market to include proxymed  inc  emdeon corporation  mckesson corporation and the trizetto group  inc  with almost all of these competitors being substantially larger or having more experience and market share than us in their respective market 
in addition  we expect that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and system integrators  internet based start up companies and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive software solutions  devices or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information systems market is rapid and there are frequent new software solution introductions  software solution enhancements  device introductions  device enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  our success will depend upon our ability to keep pace with technological change and to introduce  on a timely and cost effective basis  new and enhanced software solutions  devices and services that satisfy changing client requirements and achieve market acceptance 
risks related to the company s stock our quarterly operating results may vary which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and may continue to vary in future periods  including  variations from guidance  expectations or historical results or trends 
quarterly operating results may vary for a number of reasons including accounting policy changes  any material weaknesses identified in our internal controls  demand for our solutions  devices and services  the financial condition of our clients and potential clients  our long sales cycle  potentially long installation and implementation cycles for larger  more complex and higher priced systems and other factors described in this section and elsewhere in this report 
as a result of healthcare industry trends and the market for our cerner millennium solutions  a large percentage of our revenues are generated by the sale and installation of larger  more complex and higher priced systems 
the sales process for these systems is lengthy and involves a significant technical evaluation and commitment of capital and other resources by the client 
sales may be subject to delays due to changes in clients internal budgets  procedures for approving large capital expenditures  competing needs for other capital expenditures  availability of personnel resources and by actions taken by competitors 
delays in the expected sale  installation or implementation of these large systems may have a significant impact on our anticipated quarterly revenues and consequently our earnings  since a significant percentage of our expenses are relatively fixed 
we recognize software revenue upon the completion of standard milestone conditions and the amount of revenue recognized in any quarter depends upon our and our clients abilities to meet project milestones 
delays in meeting these milestone conditions or modification of the contract could result in a shift of revenue recognition from one quarter to another and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for a particular quarter 
our revenues from system sales historically have been lower in the first quarter of the year and greater in the fourth quarter of the year  primarily as a result of clients year end efforts to make all final capital expenditures for the then current year 
our sales forecasts may vary from actual sales in a particular quarter 
we use a pipeline system  a common industry practice  to forecast sales and trends in our business 
our sales associates monitor the status of all sales opportunities  such as the date when they estimate that a client will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar amount of the sale 
these estimates are aggregated periodically to generate a sales pipeline 
we compare this pipeline at various points in time to evaluate trends in our business 
this analysis provides guidance in business planning and forecasting  but these pipeline estimates are by their nature speculative 
our pipeline estimates are not necessarily reliable predictors of revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time  partially because of changes in the pipeline and in conversion rates of the pipeline into contracts that can be very difficult to estimate 
a negative variation in the expected conversion rate or timing of the pipeline into contracts  or in the pipeline itself  could cause our plan or forecast to be inaccurate and thereby adversely affect business 
table of contents results 
for example  a slowdown in information technology spending  adverse economic conditions or a variety of other factors can cause purchasing decisions to be delayed  reduced in amount or cancelled  which would reduce the overall pipeline conversion rate in a particular period of time 
because a substantial portion of our contracts are completed in the latter part of a quarter  we may not be able to adjust our cost structure quickly enough in response to a revenue shortfall resulting from a decrease in our pipeline conversion rate in any given fiscal quarter s 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the market for our common stock may experience significant price and volume fluctuations in response to a number of factors including actual or anticipated variations in operating results  rumors about our performance or solutions  devices and services  changes in expectations of future financial performance or estimates of securities analysts  governmental regulatory action  healthcare reform measures  client relationship developments  changes occurring in the securities markets in general and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as a matter of policy  we do not generally comment on our stock price or rumors 
furthermore  the stock market in general  and the markets for software  healthcare and information technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of actual operating performance 
our directors have authority to issue preferred stock and our corporate governance documents contain anti takeover provisions 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the preferences  rights and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be harmed by rights granted to the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
in addition  some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a potential acquirer to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
this includes  but is not limited to  provisions that provide for a classified board of directors  prohibit shareholders from taking action by written consent and restrict the ability of shareholders to call special meetings 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that prohibit us from engaging in any business combination with any interested shareholder for a period of three years from the date the person became an interested shareholder  unless certain conditions are met  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control

these extended payment term arrangements typically provide for date based payments over periods ranging from months to five years

accordingly  we consider the fee to be fixed and determinable in these extended payment term arrangements and  thus  the timing of revenue is not impacted by the existence of extended payments

sab allows registrants to record a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption to correct errors existing in prior years deemed to be material in the current year that previously had been considered immaterial 
sab is effective for the fiscal year ending december  the company assessed the impact of adoption of sab on its consolidated financial statements and determined there were no uncorrected misstatements deemed to be material under the new interpretive guidance provided in sab in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
fin also prescribes a method for computing the tax benefit of such tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the company is currently assessing the impact of adoption of fin on its results of operations and its financial position and was required to adopt fin as of the first day of the fiscal year 
critical accounting policies the company believes that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amount of revenue and other significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  software development  concentrations  allowance for doubtful accounts and potential impairments of goodwill 
these policies and the company s procedures related to these policies are described in detail below and under specific areas within this management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  note to the consolidated financial statements expands upon discussion of the company s accounting policies 
revenue recognition the company recognizes its multiple element arrangements  including software and software related services  using the residual method under sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 sop and clarified by staff accounting bulletin s sab revenue recognition in financial statements and sab no 
revenue recognition and emerging issues task force accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
key factors in the company s revenue recognition model are management s assessments that installation services are essential to the functionality of the company s software whereas implementation services are not  and the length of time it takes for the company to achieve its delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software 
if the company s business model were to change such that implementation services are deemed to be essential to the functionality of the company s software  the period of time over which the company s licensed software revenue would be recognized would lengthen 
the company generally recognizes combined revenue from the sale of its licensed software and related installation services over two key milestones  delivery and installation  based on percentages that reflect the underlying effort from planning to installation 
additionally  if the time to achieve the company s delivery and installation milestones for its licensed software were to be accelerated or decelerated  its milestones would be adjusted and the timing of revenue recognition for its licensed software could materially change 
software development costs costs incurred internally in creating computer software solutions and enhancements to those solutions are expensed until completion of a detailed program design  which is when the company determines that technological feasibility has been established 
thereafter  all software development costs are capitalized until such time as the software solutions and enhancements are available for general release  and the capitalized costs subsequently are reported at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value 
net realizable value is computed as the estimated gross future revenues from each software solution less the amount of estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product 
because the development of projected net future revenues related to our software solutions used in our net realizable value computation is based on estimates  a significant reduction in our future revenues could impact the realizability of our capitalized software development costs 
we historically have not experienced significant inaccuracies in computing the net realizable value of our software solutions and the difference 
table of contents between the net realizable value and the unamortized cost has grown over the past three years 
we expect that trend to continue in the future 
if we missed our estimates of net future revenues by up to  the amount of our capitalized software development costs would not be impaired 
capitalized costs are amortized based on current and expected net future revenue for each software solution with minimum annual amortization equal to the straight line amortization over the estimated economic life of the software solution 
the company is amortizing capitalized costs over five years 
the five year period over which capitalized software development costs are amortized is an estimate based upon the company s forecast of a reasonable useful life for the capitalized costs 
historically  use of the company s software programs by its clients has exceeded five years and is capable of being used a decade or more 
the company expects that major software information systems companies  large information technology consulting service providers and systems integrators and others specializing in the healthcare industry may offer competitive products or services 
the pace of change in the healthcare information technology market is rapid and there are frequent new product introductions  product enhancements and evolving industry standards and requirements 
as a result  the capitalized software solutions may become less valuable or obsolete and could be subject to impairment 
concentrations substantially all of the company s clients are integrated delivery networks  physicians  hospitals and other healthcare related organizations 
if significant adverse macro economic factors were to impact these organizations it could materially adversely affect the company 
the company s access to certain software and hardware components is dependent upon single and sole source suppliers 
the inability of any supplier to fulfill supply requirements of the company could affect future results 
allowance for doubtful accounts if the creditworthiness of the company s clients were to weaken or the company s collections results relative to historical experience were to decline  it could have a material adverse impact on operations and cash flows 
goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are evaluated for impairment annually or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
all goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit  where it is subject to an impairment test based on fair value 
the company again assessed its goodwill for impairment in the second quarters of and and concluded that no goodwill was impaired 
the company used a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair value of the reporting units for all periods 
the company completed nine acquisitions and one divestiture subsequent to june   which resulted in approximately million of goodwill that was not amortized in accordance with sfas goodwill amounted to  and  at december  and december   respectively 
if future  anticipated cash flows from the company s reporting units that recognized goodwill do not materialize as expected the company s goodwill could be impaired  which would result in significant write offs
