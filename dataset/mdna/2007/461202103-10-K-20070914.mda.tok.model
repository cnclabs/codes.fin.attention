you should read this md a in conjunction with the financial statements and related notes in item as discussed below  in february we completed the acquisition of digital insight corporation for a total purchase price of approximately billion 
accordingly  we have included digital insight s results of operations in our consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition 
we have also reclassified our financial statements for all periods presented to reflect certain businesses we have sold as discontinued operations

unless otherwise noted  the following discussion pertains only to our continuing operations 
executive overview this overview provides a high level discussion of our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
we believe that an understanding of these trends is important in order to understand our financial results for fiscal as well as our future prospects 
this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
seasonality our quickbooks  consumer tax and professional tax businesses are highly seasonal 
some of our other offerings are also seasonal  but to a lesser extent 
revenue from many of our small business software products  including quickbooks  tends to be at its peak around calendar year end  although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters 
sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
in our consumer tax business  a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online  for which revenue is recognized upon filing 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january and third quarter ending april we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october and fourth quarter ending july  when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 
we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 
overview of financial results total net revenue for fiscal was billion  up compared with fiscal we acquired digital insight and created a new financial institutions segment in february excluding revenue from our financial institutions segment  fiscal total net revenue increased compared with fiscal almost of the fiscal revenue increase was due to higher revenue in our consumer tax segment 
our quickbooks segment and our payroll and payments segment each contributed about of the fiscal revenue increase 

table of contents operating income from continuing operations of million for fiscal increased compared with million for fiscal fiscal revenue growth was partially offset by higher total operating costs and expenses 
higher operating expenses in fiscal reflect our acquisition of digital insight  continued investment in research and development for new and existing offerings as well as increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support the launch of our quickbooks and consumer tax offerings 
the effects of these factors are described in more detail below 
net income from continuing operations of million for fiscal increased compared with million for fiscal interest expense on the debt we issued in connection with our february acquisition of digital insight was partially offset by higher interest income 
we recorded a pre tax net gain of million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets in fiscal our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were approximately and 
diluted net income per share from continuing operations of for fiscal increased compared with for fiscal average shares outstanding declined as a result of repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the issuance of shares in connection with our employee stock plans 
on february  we completed the acquisition of digital insight for a total purchase price of approximately billion 
in order to finance a portion of this transaction  on february  we borrowed billion under a bridge credit facility  which we retired on march  with the proceeds of our issuance of billion in senior notes 
we funded the remainder of the purchase price with our existing cash balances 
our future operating results will reflect interest expense related to the senior notes 
in march we completed the sale of certain assets related to our complete payroll and premier payroll service businesses to automatic data processing  inc adp for a price of up to approximately million in cash 
the final purchase price is contingent upon the number of customers that transition to adp 
due to actual customer attrition during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we currently estimate the maximum sales price to be approximately million 
we will recognize the gain on the sale of the assets as customers are transitioned pursuant to the agreement over a period not to exceed one year from the date of the sale 
we recognized a pre tax net gain of million on the sale of the assets in fiscal in july we signed a definitive agreement to sell our intuit distribution management solutions idms business 
the sale was completed in august for approximately million in cash 
idms was part of our other businesses segment 
we have accounted for idms as a discontinued operation and segregated the net assets and operating results of idms from continuing operations for all periods presented 
we expect to record a gain on the sale of idms in the first quarter of fiscal we ended fiscal with cash and investments totaling billion 
in fiscal we generated cash from operations  from the issuance of long term debt and  to a lesser extent  from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
during the same period we used cash for the purchase of digital insight and for purchases of property and equipment 
we also repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase programs in fiscal at july   we had authorization from our board to expend million for future stock repurchases 
on march  we entered into an agreement with certain institutional lenders for a million unsecured revolving credit facility that will expire on march  we may use amounts borrowed under this credit facility for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 
to date we have not borrowed under the credit facility  but we may borrow under the credit facility from time to time as opportunities and needs arise 
see liquidity and capital resources unsecured revolving credit facility below for more information 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these 
table of contents critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form k with the audit committee of our board of directors 
net revenue revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  software subscriptions  product support  professional services  payroll services  merchant services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see net revenue in note to the financial statements in item we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
in connection with the sale of certain products  we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers 
we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant 
the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent 
we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 
net revenue return and rebate reserves as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our fiscal total net revenue would have been million lower 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the 
table of contents reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
business combinations purchase accounting under the purchase method of accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative assumptions of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative assumptions could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
at july   we had billion in goodwill and million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 
accounting for share based compensation plans prior to august   we accounted for our share based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we recorded no share based employee compensation expense for options granted under our equity incentive plan or its predecessor plans prior to august  as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the 
table of contents lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our share based incentive programs 
effective august   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b period compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after august   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of years 
effective august   we began using a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements in item to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
prior to that date we used the black scholes valuation model 
this change did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
our stock options have various restrictions  including vesting provisions and restrictions on transfer  and are often exercised prior to their contractual maturity 
we therefore believe that lattice binomial models are more capable of incorporating the features of our stock options than closed form models such as the black scholes model 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we estimated the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model 
prior to that  we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before august   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
this is the same basis on which we amortized options granted before august  for our pro forma disclosures under sfas for options granted on or after august   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when we prepare our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
we record an additional amount in our provision for income taxes in the period in which we determine that our recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate tax assessment to be 
if in a later period we determine that payment of this additional amount is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit in that later period 
as a result  our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the audit issues and related tax positions require judgment and can materially increase or decrease our effective tax rate and materially affect our operating results 
this also requires us to estimate our current tax exposure and to assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 
our net deferred tax asset at july  was million  net of the valuation allowance of million 
we recorded the valuation allowance to reflect uncertainties about whether we will be able to utilize some of our deferred tax assets consisting primarily of certain state net operating loss carryforwards before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  we could be required to increase the valuation allowance to take into account additional deferred tax assets that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in the valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we make the increase

at july   our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled billion  an increase of million from july  in fiscal we generated million in cash from our continuing operations and received approximately billion in cash from the issuance of long term debt and million in cash from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans 
during the same period we used approximately billion in cash for the purchase of digital insight net of cash acquired and million in cash for purchases of property and equipment and capitalization of internal use software 
we also repurchased million shares of our common stock for million under our stock repurchase programs during fiscal at july   we had authorization from our board to expend million for future stock repurchases 
total net revenue the table below and the discussion of net revenue by business segment that follows it are organized in accordance with our six reportable business segments 
see note to the financial statements in item for descriptions of product revenue and service and other revenue for each segment 
in february we completed the acquisition of digital insight  a provider of outsourced online banking applications and services to banks and credit unions 
we combined digital insight with our existing financial institutions group  which had been part of our other businesses segment  to create a new financial institutions segment during fiscal we have reclassified our existing financial institutions business from our other businesses segment to our financial institutions segment for all periods presented 
we have also reclassified segment results for all periods presented to reflect the transfer of our mycorporation business from our consumer tax segment to our quickbooks segment

table of contents growth in fiscal was also driven by favorable product mix  with quickbooks premier units increasing in fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal quickbooks segment net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal total quickbooks software unit sales were up in fiscal compared with fiscal this higher unit volume more than offset lower average selling prices for quickbooks software due to price reductions for new users and the elimination of upgrade rebates 
we believe that the higher unit volume was a result of product improvements  successful execution of our quickbooks product launch and growth in the category that was driven by publicity surrounding a significant new market entrant 
payroll and payments fiscal compared with fiscal payroll and payments net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal in our payments business  merchant services revenue increased in fiscal due to growth in the customer base and higher transaction volume per customer 
merchant services revenue slowed in fiscal compared with fiscal due to new customer acquisition remaining relatively constant on a larger customer base 
small business payroll revenue grew in fiscal due to growth in the customer base and  to a lesser extent  to favorable product mix that resulted in higher revenue per customer 
we estimate that revenue growth in our payroll and payments segment in fiscal would have been approximately if the sale of portions of our complete payroll and premier payroll services customer base to adp had not occurred 
fiscal compared with fiscal payroll and payments net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal our combined payroll offerings accounted for slightly more than half of the fiscal revenue increase while our merchant services represented slightly less than half of the revenue increase 
quickbooks payroll revenue was higher in fiscal compared with fiscal because of a combination of favorable product mix  growth in the customer base and the residual effects of a price increase that we implemented in fiscal revenue from our other payroll offerings increased in fiscal  driven by growth in the number of quickbooks assisted payroll and complete payroll customers processing payrolls  price increases and increased interest income on funds held for payroll customers  partially offset by attrition in the premier payroll service customer base 
merchant services revenue increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to growth in the customer base and higher transaction volume per customer 
consumer tax fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax net revenue increased million or in compared with fiscal due to growth in federal online units  excluding units donated through the free file alliance  and to price increases 
consumer tax net revenue for fiscal included the impact of approximately million in refunds to customers who experienced delays in electronically preparing or filing their income tax returns on april  we believe that the continuing trend among individual taxpayers toward the use of software  rather than manual methods  to prepare their own income tax returns will continue to be important to the growth of our consumer tax business 
fiscal compared with fiscal consumer tax net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal paid federal turbotax unit sales were up in fiscal  driven by a increase in federal turbotax online units sold which accounted for the majority of the revenue increase for that period 
to a lesser extent  higher fiscal revenue was due to growth in revenue from attach services such as electronic filing 
we believe that fiscal consumer tax revenue growth was positively affected by changes in our offering and pricing strategies that included eliminating rebates and bundling federal and state consumer tax products 
these changes were designed to simplify our offerings in response to customer feedback 
professional tax fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal due to add on product penetration and price increases 

table of contents fiscal compared with fiscal professional tax net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal due to overall growth in the professional tax customer base that was partially offset by a shift in product mix toward our lower priced offerings 
financial institutions fiscal compared with fiscal financial institutions net revenue increased million to million in fiscal compared with fiscal due almost entirely to our february acquisition of digital insight

fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses total net revenue increased million or in fiscal compared with fiscal quicken revenue was slightly lower in fiscal canadian revenue increased in fiscal due to strong growth in sales of quickbooks products and to a lesser extent to changes in foreign currency exchange rates

fiscal compared with fiscal cost of service and other revenue as a percentage of service and other revenue increased slightly to in fiscal from in fiscal the impact of growth in turbotax online and electronic tax filing services  which have relatively lower costs of revenue  was offset by the impact of our acquisition of digital insight  which has relatively higher costs of revenue 
amortization of purchased intangible assets increased in fiscal compared with fiscal due to the amortization of digital insight purchased intangible assets that we acquired in february fiscal compared with fiscal cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue decreased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal growth in turbotax units came disproportionately through our web turbotax offer  which had lower costs per unit than our desktop offerings

recent accounting pronouncements fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  we are in the process of evaluating this guidance and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of fin will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas  fair value measurements in september the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas  fair value measurements  and sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers 
our investments and funds held for payroll customers consist of instruments that meet quality standards consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market or cash management funds  we diversify our holdings by limiting our investments and funds held for payroll customers with any individual issuer 
the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments as of july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents and investments that are part of funds held for payroll customers on our balance sheet 
cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds 
approximately of our available for sale debt securities have an interest reset date  put date or mandatory call date within one year 
at july   the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 
years ending july  and in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents investments total interest rate risk our cash equivalents and our portfolio of investments and funds held for payroll customers are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents  investments and funds held for payroll customers and the value of those investments 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by or about basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million 
should interest rates increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments and funds held for payroll customers would decline by approximately million 
we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our million revolving credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from to based on our senior debt credit ratings 
consequently  our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
in connection with our acquisition of digital insight  on march  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due on march  and million of senior unsecured notes due on march  since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates  they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
impact of foreign currency rate changes the functional currency of our international operating subsidiaries is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
revenue  costs and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange in effect during the period 
we report translation gains and losses as a 
table of contents separate component of stockholders equity 
we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in our statements of operations 
since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars  british pounds and indian rupees into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
