principles of accounting for ownership interests in partner companies the various interests that we acquire in our partner companies and private equity funds are accounted for under three methods consolidation  equity or cost 
the applicable accounting method is generally determined based on our influence over the entity  primarily determined based on our voting interest in the entity 
consolidation method 
partner companies in which we directly or indirectly own more than of the outstanding voting securities are accounted for under the consolidation method of accounting 
participation of other partner company shareholders in the income or losses of our consolidated partner companies is reflected as minority interest in the consolidated statements of operations 
minority interest adjusts our consolidated operating results to 
table of contents reflect only our share of the earnings or losses of the consolidated partner company 
if there is no minority interest balance remaining on the consolidated balance sheets related to the respective partner company  we record of the consolidated partner company s losses  we record of subsequent earnings of the partner company to the extent of such previously recognized losses in excess of our proportionate share 
equity method 
the partner companies whose results are not consolidated  but over whom we exercise significant influence  are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we also account for our interests in some private equity funds under the equity method of accounting  based on our respective general and limited partner interests 
under the equity method of accounting  our share of the income or loss of the company is reflected in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we report our share of the income or loss of the equity method partner companies on a one quarter lag 
when the carrying value of our holding in an equity method partner company is reduced to zero  no further losses are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations unless we have outstanding guarantee obligations or have committed additional funding to the equity method company 
when the equity method partner company subsequently reports income  we will not record our share of such income until it equals the amount of our share of losses not previously recognized 
cost method 
partner companies not consolidated or accounted for under the equity method are accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
under the cost method  our share of the income or losses of such partner companies is not included in our consolidated statements of operations 
however  the effect of the change in market value of cost method holdings classified as trading securities is reflected in other income loss  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
these judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly important because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include the following revenue recognition  recoverability of long lived assets  recoverability of goodwill  recoverability of ownership interests in and advances to companies  income taxes  commitments and contingencies  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition during  and  our revenue from continuing operations was primarily attributable to acsis since december  alliance consulting  clarient  laureate pharma since december and pacific title 

table of contents acsis generates revenue from i software fees  which consist of revenue from the licensing of software  ii services revenue  which consist of fees from consulting  implementation and training services  plus customer support services  and iii hardware and reimbursed project expenses 
acsis recognizes software fees in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
although acsis follows specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  the application of those guidelines requires judgment including i whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for those elements  ii whether customizations or modifications of the software are significant  and iii whether collection of the software fee is probable 
additionally  acsis specifically evaluates any other terms in its license transactions  including but not limited to  options to purchase additional software at a future date  extended payment terms and functionality commitments not delivered with the software 
acsis recognizes software license revenue when the following criteria are met a signed contract is obtained  delivery of the products has occurred  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
acsis generally recognizes license revenue using the residual method when there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of all undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement that is not accounted for using long term contract accounting 
for those contracts that contain significant customization or modifications  license revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
most of acsis software arrangements include professional services 
acsis provides professional services under service agreements on a time and material basis or based on a fixed price arrangement 
the revenues from acsis time and material based professional consulting and implementation services are recognized as the work is performed  provided that the customer has a contractual obligation to pay  the fee is non refundable and collection is probable 
delays in project implementation will result in delays in revenue recognition 
acsis recognizes revenues from professional consulting services under fixed price arrangements  using the proportional performance method based on direct labor costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated labor costs required to complete the project 
revisions to the estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
project losses are provided for in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
if acsis does not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or if acsis does not manage their projects properly within the planned periods of time  then future consulting margins on its projects may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
hardware revenue is generated from the resale of a variety of hardware products  developed and manufactured primarily by third parties  which are integrated with and complementary to acsis software solutions 
these products include computer equipment  rfid chip readers  bar code printers and scanners and other peripherals 
acsis generally purchases hardware from vendors only after receiving an order from a customer  and revenue is recognized upon shipment by the vendor to the customer unless the hardware is an element in an arrangement that includes services that involve significant customization or modifications to software  in which case  hardware revenue is bundled with the software and services are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
alliance consulting generates revenue primarily from consulting services 
alliance consulting generally recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services are performed  the service fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
revenue from services is recognized as services are performed 
alliance consulting also performs certain services under fixed price service contracts related to discrete projects 
alliance consulting recognizes revenue from these contracts using the percentage of completion method  primarily based on the actual labor hours incurred to date compared to the estimated total hours of the project 
any losses expected to be incurred on jobs in process are charged to income in the period such losses become known 
changes in estimates of total costs could result in changes in the amount of revenue recognized 
clarient generates revenue from diagnostic services  system sales and fee per use charges 
clarient recognizes revenue for diagnostic services at the time of completion of services at amounts equal to the contractual rates allowed from third parties including medicare  insurance companies and  to a small degree  private pay patients 
these expected amounts are based both on medicare allowable rates and clarient s collection experience with other third party payors 

table of contents clarient recognizes revenue for fee per use agreements based on the greater of actual usage fees or the minimum monthly rental fee 
under this pricing model  clarient owns most of the acis instruments that are engaged in service and  accordingly  all related depreciation and maintenance and service costs are expensed as incurred 
revenue for instruments that are sold is recognized and deferred using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of sop  as amended by statement of position no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  clarient defers revenue for the fair value of its undelivered elements eg  maintenance and recognizes revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement eg  software license when the basic criteria in sop have been met 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract  typically twelve months 
systems sold under a leasing arrangement are accounted for as sales type leases pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for leases  if applicable 
clarient recognizes the net effect of these transactions as a sale because of the bargain purchase option granted to the lessee 
clarient has entered into a distribution and development agreement with dako  which includes multiple elements 
those elements include distribution rights  acis instruments  research and development services  training and maintenance 
the agreement calls for an upfront payment and additional payments as instruments are delivered or milestones are achieved under the research and development component 
clarient accounts for this arrangement under the percentage of completion method using the zero profit margin approach 
under this approach  revenue is recognized in amounts equal to the costs incurred to provide the products and services 
clarient further limits the amount of revenue recognized to the amount of fees that are fixed or determinable under the agreement 
because clarient does not have evidence of fair value for certain elements that span the term of the agreement  the profit earned will be recognized over the remaining term of the agreement once the research and development services are complete 
as of december   the research and development services were ongoing 
on march   clarient sold its technology group business which developed  manufactured and marketed the acis automated image analysis system and related intellectual property to zeiss microimaging  inc laureate pharma s revenue is primarily derived from contract manufacturing work  process development services  and formulation and filling 
laureate pharma enters into revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in order to meet its customers needs 
multiple element revenue agreements are evaluated under emerging issues task force eitf issue number  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in eitf are treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
revenue is generally recognized upon the performance of services 
certain services are performed under fixed price contracts 
revenue from these contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
when current cost estimates indicate a loss is expected to be incurred  the entire loss is recorded in the period in which it is identified 
changes in estimates of total costs could result in changes in the amount of revenue recognized 
pacific title s revenue is primarily derived from providing archival and post production services to the motion picture and television industry 
pacific title recognizes revenue generally upon the performance of services 
pacific title performs certain services under fixed price contracts 
revenue from these contracts is recognized on a percentage of completion basis based on costs incurred to total estimated costs to be incurred 
changes in the estimates of total cost could result in changes in the amount of revenue recognized 
any anticipated losses on contracts are expensed when identified 
recoverability of long lived assets we test long lived assets  including property and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
we evaluate the recoverability by determining whether the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset cover the carrying value at the evaluation date 
if the 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value  we measure any impairment loss as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the carrying value of net intangible assets at december  was million 
the carrying value of net property and equipment at december  was million 
recoverability of goodwill we conduct a review for impairment of goodwill at least annually on december st 
additionally  on an interim basis  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or expected future operating results  significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends or a decline in a company s stock price for a sustained period 
we test for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit same as or one level below an operating segment as defined in sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
if we determine that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  we assess whether goodwill of the reporting unit is impaired 
to determine fair value  we use a number of valuation methods including quoted market prices  discounted cash flows and revenue and acquisition multiples 
depending on the complexity of the valuation and the significance of the carrying value of the goodwill to the consolidated financial statements  we may engage an outside valuation firm to assist us in determining fair value 
as an overall check on the reasonableness of the fair values attributed to our reporting units  we will consider comparing the aggregate fair values for all reporting units with our average total market capitalization for a reasonable period of time 
the carrying value of goodwill at december  was million 
our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying value of our goodwill is not impaired  there can be no assurance that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
impairment charges related to goodwill of consolidated partner companies are included in goodwill impairment in the consolidated statements of operations 
recoverability of ownership interests in and advances to companies on a continuous basis but no less frequently than at the end of each quarterly period we evaluate the carrying value of our equity and cost method partner companies for possible impairment based on achievement of business plan objectives and milestones  the fair value of each company relative to its carrying value  the financial condition and prospects of the company and other relevant factors 
we then determine whether there has been an other than temporary decline in the carrying value of our ownership interest in the company 
impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of privately held companies is generally determined based on the value at which independent third parties have invested or have committed to invest in these companies or based on other valuation methods including discounted cash flows  valuation of comparable public companies and the valuation of acquisitions of similar companies 
the fair value of our ownership interests in private equity funds is generally determined based on the value of our pro rata portion of the funds net assets and estimated future proceeds from sales of investments provided by the funds managers 
the new carrying value of a company is not written up if circumstances suggest the value of the company has subsequently recovered 

table of contents our partner companies operate in industries which are rapidly evolving and extremely competitive 
it is reasonably possible that our accounting estimates with respect to the ultimate recoverability of the carrying value of ownership interests in and advances to partner companies could change in the near term and that the effect of such changes on our consolidated financial statements could be material 
while we believe that the current recorded carrying values of our equity and cost method partner companies are not impaired  there can be no assurance that our future results will confirm this assessment or that a significant write down or write off will not be required in the future 
total impairment charges related to ownership interests in and advances to companies are included in the following table year ended december  accounting method in millions equity cost total impairment charges related to equity method companies are included in equity loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment charges related to cost method companies are included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent that we believe recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized in future years 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  then the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
commitments and contingencies from time to time  we are a defendant or plaintiff in various legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
additionally  we have received distributions as both a general partner and a limited partner from certain private equity funds 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to return a portion or all the distributions we received as a general partner to the fund for a further distribution to the fund s limited partners the clawback 
we are also a guarantor of various third party obligations and commitments  and are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of provision required for these commitments and contingencies  if any  which would be charged to earnings  is made after careful analysis of each matter 
the provision may change in the future due to new developments or changes in circumstances 
changes in the provision could increase or decrease our earnings in the period the changes are made 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  prior to january   we accounted for employee stock based compensation in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded for stock options issued to employees at fair market value 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value 
table of contents method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
under this application  we are required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
we estimate the grant date fair value of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the expected term of the award and the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term 
changes in these assumptions and in the estimated forfeitures of stock option awards can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the requisite service periods for market based stock option awards are based on our estimate of the dates on which the market conditions will be met as determined using a monte carlo simulation model 
changes in the derived requisite service period or achievement of market capitalization targets earlier than estimated can materially affect the amount of stock based compensation recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations we present our five consolidated partner companies as separate segments acsis  alliance consulting  clarient  laureate pharma and pacific title

sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors using both the income statement approach and the balance sheet approach 
in the initial year of adoption  if a company determines that an adjustment to prior year financial statements is required under either approach  sab allows for a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings
