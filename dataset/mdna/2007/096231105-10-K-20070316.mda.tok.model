executive overview we operate through two business segments 
bluegreen resorts develops  markets and sells vois in our bluegreen vacation club resorts  and provides resort management services to resort property owners associations 
bluegreen communities acquires large tracts of real estate  which are subdivided  improved in some cases to include a golf course on the property and sold  typically on a retail basis  as homesites 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions  which changes the rules for many aspects of timeshare accounting  including revenue recognition  inventory costing and incidental operations see note of the financial statements for more information on sfas no 
and its impact on our financial statements 
the adoption of sfas no 
decreased income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle by million or per diluted share for in addition  we recognized a million or per diluted share charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  net of income tax and minority interest in  for the adoption of sfas no 
therefore  on a pro forma basis excluding the impact of sfas no 
 net income would have been million or per diluted share for see results of operations below for a discussion of the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on the resort division 
we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our gross revenues and net earnings 
this seasonality may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  with the majority of our gross revenues and net earnings historically occurring in the quarters ending in june and september each year 
however  as a result of the required adoption of sfas no 
 we anticipate that prospectively the majority of our bluegreen resorts gross revenues and net earnings will be recognized in the quarters ending in september and december of each year  primarily due to the deferral and subsequent recognition of voi sales revenue due to the buyers commitment requirement 
also  as sfas no 
does not allow the restatement of prior year results of operations  our quarterly statements of income are not easily comparable to the respective quarterly statements of income 
other material fluctuations in operating results may occur due to the timing of development and the requirement that we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method of income recognition  income is recognized as work progresses 
measures of progress are based on the relationship of costs incurred to date to expected total costs 
we expect that we will continue to invest in projects that will require substantial development with significant capital requirements  and as a consequence  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly between quarterly and annual periods as a result of the required use of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we believe that inflation and changing prices have materially impacted our revenues and results of operations  specifically due to periodic increases in the sales prices of our vois and homesites and continued increases in construction and development costs 
we expect construction and development costs to continue to increase for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to increase our sales prices or that increased construction costs will not have a material adverse impact on our gross margin 
in addition  to the extent that inflation in general or increased prices for our voi and homesites adversely impact consumer sentiment  our results of operations could be adversely impacted 
also  to the extent inflationary trends affect interest rates  a portion of our debt service costs may increase 
we recognize revenue on homesite and voi sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash  the refund or rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development of the real estate sold 
refund or rescission periods include those required by law and those provided for in our sales contracts 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that incentives and other similarly treated items such as customer down payment equity earned through our sampler program be considered in calculating the required down payment for our voi sales 
if  after considering the value of sales incentives provided  the required of sales price down payment threshold is not met  the voi sale and the related cost of sale and direct selling costs are deferred and not recognized until the buyer s commitment test is satisfied  generally through the receipt of required mortgage note payments from the buyer 
further  in cases where all development has not been completed  recognition of income is subject to the percentage of completion method of accounting 
costs associated with the acquisition and development of vacation ownership resorts and residential communities  including carrying costs such as interest and taxes  are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of real estate sold as the respective revenues are recognized 
a portion of our revenues historically has been and is expected to continue to be comprised of gains on sales of notes receivable 
the gains are recorded on our consolidated statement of income and the related retained interests in the notes receivable sold are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at the time of sale 
effective january   pursuant to sfas no 
 the portion of these gains related to the reversal of previously recorded allowances for loan losses on the receivables sold is recorded as a component of revenue on sales of vois 
the amount of gains recognized and the fair value of the retained interests recorded are based in part on management s best estimates of future prepayment  default rates  loss severity rates  discount rates and other considerations in light of then current conditions 
if actual prepayments with respect to loans occur more quickly than we projected at the time such loans were sold  as can occur when interest rates decline  interest would be less than expected and may cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to operations 
if actual defaults or other factors discussed above with respect to loans sold are greater than estimated  charge offs would exceed previously estimated amounts and the cash flow from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would decrease 
also  to the extent the portfolio of receivables sold fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to  for example  an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or certain other events occur  the funds received from obligors must be distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow to us from the retained interests in notes receivable sold would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
if these situations were to occur on a material basis  it could cause a decline in the fair value of the retained interests and a charge to earnings currently 
there is no assurance that the carrying value of our retained interests in notes receivable sold will be fully realized or that future loan sales will be consummated or  if consummated  result in gains 
see vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements  below 
in addition  we have historically sold vacation ownership receivables to financial institutions through warehouse purchase facilities to monetize the receivables while accumulating receivables for a future term securitization transaction 
we have structured our current warehouse purchase facility with bb t so that legal sales of vacation ownership receivables through this facility will be accounted for as on balance sheet borrowings rather than as off balance sheet sales 
therefore  we will not recognize a gain on the sales of receivables transferred to bb t until such receivables are subsequently included in a properly structured term securitization transaction 
in september  we included in the term securitization receivables previously transferred to the bb t purchase facility 
as a result  as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the bb t purchase facility 
we expect to transfer additional receivables to the bb t purchase facility or a similar on balance sheet facility for the foreseeable future which will continue to impact future quarterly earnings patterns as compared to comparable prior periods 
we continue to spend a substantial amount of management time and resources to comply with changing laws  regulations and standards relating to accounting  corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  new securities and exchange commission regulations and new york stock exchange rules 
in particular  section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires management s annual review and evaluation of our internal control systems  and attestations as to the effectiveness of these systems by our independent registered accounting firm 
we expect to continue to expend significant management time and resources documenting and testing our internal control systems and procedures 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be in a position to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of commitments and contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those that relate to the recognition of revenue  including revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method of accounting  our reserve for loan losses  the valuation of retained interests in notes receivable sold and the related gains on sales of notes receivable  the recovery of the carrying value of real estate inventories  golf courses  intangible assets and other assets  and the estimate of contingent liabilities related to litigation and other claims and assessments 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from management s estimates  our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see also note of the notes to consolidated financial statements o revenue recognition and inventory cost allocation 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  as amended by sfas no 
regarding voi sales  we recognize revenue on voi and homesite sales when a minimum of of the sales price has been received in cash buyer s commitment  the legal rescission period has expired  collectibility of the receivable representing the remainder of the sales price is reasonably assured and we have completed substantially all of our obligations with respect to any development related to the real estate sold 
we believe that we use a reasonably reliable methodology to estimate the collectibility of the receivables representing the remainder of the sales price of real estate sold 
see the further discussion of our policies regarding the estimation of credit losses on our notes receivable below 
should we become unable to reasonably estimate the collectibility of our receivables  we may have to defer the recognition of sales and our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january   the calculation of the adequacy of the buyer s commitment changed so that cash received towards the purchase of our vois is reduced by the value of certain incentives provided to the buyer at the time of sale 
if  after consideration of the value of the incentive  the total down payment received from the buyer is less than of the sales price  the voi sale  and the related cost of sales and direct selling expenses  are deferred until such time that sufficient cash is received from the customer  generally through receipt of mortgage payments 
changes to the quantity  type  or value of sales incentives that we provide to buyers of our vois may result in additional voi sales being deferred  and thus our results of operations could be materially  adversely impacted 
in cases where all development has not been completed  we recognize revenue in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting 
should our estimates of the total anticipated cost of completing of our bluegreen resorts or bluegreen communities projects increase  we may be required to defer a greater amount of revenue or may be required to defer revenue for a longer period of time  and thus our results of operations could be materially  adversely impacted 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  the capitalized costs of our real estate projects are assigned to individual homesites in the projects based on the relative estimated sales value of each homesite 
prior to this method of allocation was also used to determine the inventory value and related costs of sales for our vois 
effective january   as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 voi inventory and cost of sales is accounted for using the relative sales value method 
under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is calculated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage the ratio of total estimated development cost to total estimated voi revenue  including the estimated incremental revenue from the resale of voi inventory repossessed  generally as a result of the default of the related receivable 
should our estimates of the sales values of our voi and homesite inventories differ materially from their ultimate selling prices  our gross profit could be adversely impacted 
o allowance for loan losses 
prior to january   we estimated credit losses on our notes receivable portfolios generated in connection with the sale of vois in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as our notes receivable portfolios consist of a large group of smaller balance  homogeneous loans 
consistent with staff accounting bulletin no 
 selected loan loss allowance methodology and documentation issues  we first segmented our notes receivable by identifying risk characteristics that were common to groups of loans and then estimated credit losses based on the risks associated with these segments 
effective january   we changed our accounting for loan losses in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 we estimate uncollectible notes receivable based on historical default rates for similar voi notes receivable over the applicable historical period 
we use a static pool analysis  which tracks uncollectibles for each year s sales over the entire life of those notes 
we also consider whether the historical economic conditions are comparable to current economic conditions 
we currently group our notes receivable in two pools for analytical purposes 
although our credit policies are identical in all locations  the customer demographics and historical uncollectibility have varied between these two pools 
we review our reserve for loan losses on at least a quarterly basis 
should our estimates of these and other pertinent factors change  our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity position could be materially  adversely affected 
o transfers of financial assets 
when we transfer financial assets to third parties  such as when we sell notes receivable pursuant to our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities  we evaluate whether or not such transfer should be accounted for as a sale pursuant to sfas no 
and related interpretations 
the evaluation of sale treatment under sfas no 
involves legal assessments of the transactions  which include determining whether the transferred assets have been isolated from us ie  put presumptively beyond our reach or the reach of our creditors  even in bankruptcy or other receivership  determining whether each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received  and ensuring that we do not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets other than through a cleanup call 
we believe that we have obtained appropriate legal opinions and other guidance deemed necessary to properly account for our transfers of financial assets as sales in accordance with sfas no 
in connection with the sales of notes receivable referred to above  we retain subordinated tranches  rights to excess interest spread and servicing rights  all of which are retained interests in the notes receivable sold 
gain or loss on the sale of the notes receivable depends in part on the allocation of the previous carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
we initially and periodically estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions prepayment rates  loss severity rates  default rates and discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
should our estimates of these key assumptions change or should the portfolios sold fail to satisfy specified performance criteria and therefore trigger provisions whereby outside investors in the portfolios are paid on an accelerated basis  there could be a reduction in the fair value of the retained interests and our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized an other than temporary decrease of approximately   and million  respectively  in the fair market value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization  based on higher than anticipated default rates in the portfolio sold 
there were no other than temporary decreases recognized in o asset impairment 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amounts of our long lived assets including our real estate properties under the guidelines of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
factors that we consider in making this evaluation include our estimates of remaining life of project sales for each project based on current retail prices and our estimates of costs to complete each project 
should our estimates of these factors change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
o goodwill 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis by estimating the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill or intangible assets have been assigned 
as of december  and  only our bluegreen resorts reporting unit had any recorded goodwill 
should our estimates of the fair value of our reporting units change  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
results of operations we review financial information  allocate resources and manage our business as two segments  bluegreen resorts and bluegreen communities 
the information reviewed is based on internal reports and excludes general and administrative expenses attributable to corporate overhead 
the information provided is based on a management approach and is used by us for the purpose of tracking trends and changes in results 
it does not reflect the actual economic costs  contributions or results of operations of the segments as stand alone businesses 
if a different basis of presentation or allocation were utilized  the relative contributions of the segments might differ but the relative trends  in our view  would likely not be materially impacted

bluegreen resorts sales increased million or during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 sales would have increased million or during as compared to the pro forma increase was due primarily to same resort sales increases at many of our sales offices 
same resort sales increased by approximately during as compared to and were highlighted by increases in sales at the fountains sales office in orlando  florida  our bluegreen wilderness club at big cedar sales office in ridgedale  missouri  our falls village sales office in branson  missouri  and our mountainloft sales office in gatlinburg  tennessee 
the overall increase in sales was due in part to our continued focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased by and accounted for of resort sales during as compared to during this  combined with an overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during to approximately  prospects during  and a relatively consistent  overall sale to tour conversion ratio of during these periods  significantly contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to our sale to tour conversion ratio for new prospects ie  excluding sales to our existing owners was and during and  respectively 
the increase in the number of prospects seen by bluegreen resorts and  consequently the increase in sales was partially due to our eight new sales sites 
our new sales offices include an offsite sales office in atlanta  georgia opened in november  an offsite sales office in chicago  illinois opened in february  an offsite sales office in las vegas  nevada opened in july  and sales offices located at two of our new resorts daytona seabreeze in daytona beach shores  florida opened in december  and carolina grande in myrtle beach  south carolina opened in march 
we also opened sales offices in williamsburg  virginia opened in august and wisconsin dells  wisconsin opened in july on the grounds where we recently purchased properties for future resort locations 
the increase in the average sales price per transaction  primarily due to a system wide price increase effective january  also contributed to the increase in sales 
the million or increase in bluegreen resorts sales during as compared to was due primarily to same site sales increases at our various sales offices 
same site sales increases aggregated million and were highlighted by the increase in sales at the fountains sales office in orlando  florida  our dallas  texas offsite sales office  our harbour lights sales office in myrtle beach  south carolina and our bluegreen wilderness club at big cedar sales office 
we opened four new sales sites in  which generated an aggregate of million in sales 
our new sales sites were our offsite sales office in king of prussia  pennsylvania opened march and subsequently closed in december of  our sales office at the suites at hershey resort opened june  our offsite sales office in atlanta  georgia opened november and our sales office at the daytona seabreeze resort opened december 
the overall sales increase was also due to our continued focus on marketing to our growing bluegreen vacation club owner base 
sales to owners increased to approximately of resorts sales during as compared to of resorts sales in this  combined with a overall increase in the number of sales prospects seen by bluegreen resorts from approximately  prospects during to approximately  prospects during  and a slightly higher sale to tour conversion ratio during increasing to in from in significantly contributed to the overall sales increase during as compared to bluegreen resorts gross margin percentages vary between periods based on the relative costs of the specific vois sold in each respective period 
excluding the adoption of sfas no 
 our gross margin would have increased from during to during  primarily as a result of the previously discussed price increase 
as compared to the gross margin in  our gross margin for was favorably impacted by the sale of relatively lower cost vois acquired through opportunistic acquisitions in approximately condominium units in which we were selling vois were constructed and became available for sale at the beginning of at the fountains  which had a product cost of approximately of sales price 
other resort operations revenues decreased million or during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 other resort operations revenue would have decreased million or during as compared to the adoption of sfas no 
had the impact of decreasing other resort operations revenue due to the reclassification of rental proceeds from other resort operations revenue to net against cost of other resort operations  partially offset by the classification of revenue for sales incentives for voi sales to other resort operations revenue 
the results also represent lower sales of mini vacation packages on behalf of third parties 
during  we have been transitioning our mini vacation package business from primarily selling the packages to third parties to using the sales tours generated by mini vacations primarily for use at our own sales offices 
this transition was substantially completed in the second half of as a result  this has had the effect of increasing the profitability of our other resort operations reducing costs in excess of revenues but increasing our selling and marketing costs 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in fees earned by our wholly owned title company as well as higher resort management fees earned by our resort management company 
resort management fees increased in the aggregate due to an increase in the number of resorts for which we provide management services 
other resort operations revenues increased million or during as compared to the increase was primarily due to higher fees earned by our wholly owned title company for providing title processing services on all of our voi sales  commensurate with the increase in resort sales 
cost of other resort operations decreased million  or  during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 cost of other resort operations would have decreased million or during as compared to the adoption of sfas no 
had the impact of decreasing cost of other resort operations due primarily to the reclassification of rental proceeds from other resort operations revenue and the reclassification of the net proceeds of the sampler program from selling and marketing expenses to a reduction to cost of other resort operations 
the decrease also reflects a significant reduction in the amount of cost related to mini vacations sold on behalf of third parties  as previously discussed  partially offset by higher subsidies incurred relative to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
these subsidies increased in the aggregate based on an increase in our unsold voi inventory 
cost of other resort operations increased million or during as compared to the increase in the cost of other resort operations was in connection with increases in the related revenues discussed above as well as due to higher subsidies paid to the property owners associations that maintain our resorts 
these subsidies increased in the aggregate based on an increase in our voi inventory 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the increase in selling and marketing expense during  as compared to  also reflects a general increase in overall marketing expenses due primarily to start up costs related to new marketing alliances  higher marketing expenses as a percentage of sales at our newly opened off site sales offices and the previously discussed transition of our mini vacations packages from being sold externally to being used internally 
these increases are partially offset by the favorable impact on selling and marketing cost of the increase in sales to existing owners during as compared to excluding the impact of sfas no 
 selling and marketing expense would have increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  on a pro forma basis  selling and marketing expenses increased from during to during the adoption of sfas no 
had the impact of increasing selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales as a result of the immediate recognition of marketing expenses associated with certain voi sales that have not yet been recognized  and due to the reclassification of the net profits of the sampler program from selling and marketing expenses to a reduction of cost of other resort operations 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately during as compared to for the increase in selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of start up marketing costs incurred at our new sales offices  partially offset by the favorable impact on selling and marketing cost of the increase in sales to existing owners during as compared to we believe that selling and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales is an important indicator of the performance of bluegreen resorts and our performance as a whole 
no assurances can be given that selling and marketing expenses will not continue to increase as a percentage of sales in future periods 
field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to as a percentage of sales  field general and administrative expenses increased from during to in  however  excluding the impact of sfas no 
 the expenses would have only been of sales 
field general and administrative expenses for bluegreen resorts increased million or during as compared to the increase in field general and administrative expenses in both periods was primarily a result of the cost of opening and operating our new sales offices 
additionally  the increase in also reflects costs to close an off site sales office located in king of prussia  pennsylvania

bluegreen communities sales were reduced by million during and were increased by million during as a result of the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
additionally  because the platting process for certain properties sold near the end of was not completed until before the end of  we were unable to recognize approximately million sales in  that is anticipated to be recognized in bluegreen communities sales increased approximately million or less than during as compared to due primarily to the sell out of several communities during the primary reason for our slower growth in communities was traditions of braselton  a  acre golf course community in braselton  georgia  and brickshire  our golf course community located in new kent virginia were substantially sold out and higher sales were generated during partially offsetting these declines were higher sales at many of our other communities  including sanctuary cove at st

during  we commenced sales at sugartree on the brazos  our community located outside fort worth  texas  saddle creek forest  our community located near houston  texas and the settlement at patriot ranch  our community located near san antonio  texas 
as noted above  certain of our properties substantially sold out earlier in and than previously anticipated as a result of the continued strong demand for our communities and our challenge to replace sold out properties with new communities with similar profit margins 
although there is no assurance that we will be successful  we are continually exploring the acquisition of properties in markets where we currently conduct business  and in new regions of the country  in an attempt to maintain appropriate levels of properties in our portfolio 
bluegreen communities gross margin decreased from in to in variations in cost structures and the market pricing of projects available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects  which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc 
impact the gross margin of bluegreen communities from period to period 
these factors  as well as the impact of percentage of completion accounting  will cause variations in gross margin between periods  although the gross margin of bluegreen communities has historically been between and of sales and is expected to approximate these percentages for the foreseeable future 
in addition  during  our gross margin was negatively impacted by the bulk sale of property near san diego  california  which had a relatively low margin  as well as the recognition of a charge of approximately million to repair a lake amenity at a nearly sold out bluegreen community 
bluegreen communities gross margin increased from in to in as a result of variations in cost structures and the market pricing of projects available for sale as well as the opening of phases of projects which include premium homesites eg  water frontage  preferred views  larger acreage homesites  etc other communities operations include the operation of our golf courses  as well as realty resale operations at several of our residential land communities

this was primarily due to increased play at our traditions of braselton and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses located in georgia and north carolina  respectively 
our golf course operations incurred aggregate losses of  and  during and  respectively  and in earned an aggregate profit of  the results of golf course operations reflect fixed operating expenses  low seasonal revenues during the winter months and high maintenance costs during periods when we are marketing homesites in the surrounding community 
also  certain of our golf courses are still in their early years of operations during the periods presented 
we believe that the operating results of these new courses should improve as individuals who have purchased homesites in the communities in which these courses are located build their homes and begin living in the community  as this should increase the amount of play on our golf courses 
however  there is no assurance that such improvement in operating results will be achieved 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses remained constant at during and the decrease in total selling and marketing costs in reflected lower commission commensurate with the sales decrease and as a result of bulk sales which typically carry a lower commission percentage 
this decrease was partially offset by higher advertising expenses  which were the result of start up advertising associated with our new developments 
selling and marketing expenses for bluegreen communities decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales selling and marketing expenses decreased from in to in these expenditures decreased as a percentage of sales due to a higher average sales price per homesite coupled with relative advertising efficiencies at our golf course communities in georgia  as compared to our other projects 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses decreased from million during to million during this decrease in general and administrative expenses in was due to the closure of five sales offices in the second half of the offices at silver lakes ranch  mountain lakes ranch  quail springs ranch  brickshire  and the traditions of braselton were closed as a result of the substantial sell out at these locations 
as a percentage of sales  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in  reflecting the overall decrease in sales 
bluegreen communities general and administrative expenses remained constant from to as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
as of december   bluegreen communities had million of sales and million of field operating profit deferred under percentage of completion accounting 
corporate general and administrative expenses 
our corporate general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses associated with administering the various support functions at our corporate headquarters  including accounting  human resources  information technology  resorts acquisition and development  mortgage servicing  treasury and legal 
such expenses were million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the million or increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to o the recognition of stock compensation expense of million as a result of adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  including million related to the modification of existing stock options of our chief executive officer who retired at the end of our former chief executive officer and charges totaling million related to the total compensation payable under a separation agreement with our former chief executive officer  o the recognition of expenses totaling approximately million associated with the adoption of our shareholders rights plan and related litigation  o a million write off related to the abandonment of a software development project  and  o an overall increase in corporate headcount to support our growth at bluegreen resorts 
these increases were partially off set by higher profits from our mortgage servicing operations in as compared to as previously discussed  we earn fees for servicing the notes receivable that we have sold in term securitization transactions and through our vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities 
the million or increase in corporate general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to o the expansion of our corporate facilities  as well as increased personnel and other expenses in our information technology  resort acquisitions and development  and accounting departments to support our growth  o increased accounting and auditing expenses of million  primarily incurred in connection with requirements associated with the sarbanes oxley act of  and  o severance charges of approximately million associated with the departure of our former chief financial officer 
these increases were partially off set by lower legal expenses and higher profits from our mortgage servicing operation realized during as compared to for a discussion of field selling  general and administrative expenses  see sales and field operations  above 
interest income 
interest income is earned from our notes receivable  retained interests in notes receivable sold and cash and cash equivalents 
interest income was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in interest income during as compared to was due primarily to higher interest accretion on our retained interest in notes receivable sold as a result of higher average retained interests in due to the sale of additional notes receivable and higher average vacation ownership notes receivable balances during as compared to in addition  we recognized an other than temporary decrease of approximately  in the fair value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization transaction  based on higher than projected default rates in the portfolio sold 
the decrease in interest income during was due to lower interest income earned from our notes receivable commensurate with a lower average aggregate notes receivable balance during the period as compared to in addition  we recognized an other than temporary decrease of approximately  in the fair value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization transaction  based on higher than projected default rates in the portfolio sold 
gain on sales of notes receivable 
we recognized gains on the sale of notes receivable totaling million  million  and million during   and  respectively 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
 approximately million of the gain in was reflected as an increase to voi sales 
we sell a portion of our vacation ownership notes receivable pursuant to vacation ownership receivables securitization transactions or through vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities that qualify for sale treatment per sfas no 
the amount of notes receivable sold during a period depends on several factors  including the amount of availability  if any  under receivables purchase facilities  the amount of eligible receivables available for sale  our cash requirements  the covenants and other provisions of the relevant vacation ownership receivables purchase facility as described further below and management s discretion 
the generally accepted accounting principles governing our sale of receivable transactions is evolving and achieving off balance sheet accounting treatment is becoming more difficult 
due to the complexity of the accounting rules surrounding such transactions  we have decided to limit the use of off balance sheet structures in the future 
in  we structured a vacation ownership receivables purchase facility that is used to accumulate receivables pending a term securitization transaction in a manner so as to account for sales of receivables under such facilities as on balance sheet borrowings pursuant to sfas no 
no gains were recognized on the sales of receivables to this facility until the receivables were included in an appropriately structured term securitization transaction 
we expect to continue this accounting treatment for similarly structured facilities in the foreseeable future 
as a result  we expect that the volatility of our quarterly earnings will increase prospectively  but we do not anticipate that this will materially impact annual earnings  assuming the continued availability of the facilities and ultimate securitizations 
interest expense 
interest expense was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the increase in interest expense for as compared  was primarily a result of higher average debt outstanding and higher interest rates in partially offset by increased capitalized interest on current development activity 
average debt outstanding in increased in part as a result of our on balance sheet treatment of transfers to the bb t purchase facility as discussed further under credit facilities for bluegreen resorts receivables and inventories and due to increased borrowings in connection with inventory acquisition and development activities 
the decrease in interest expense for as compared  was primarily a result of lower average debt outstanding and more interest being capitalized due to increased construction activity  partially off set by the impact of increased borrowing rates 
total interest expense capitalized to construction in progress was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
our effective cost of borrowing was   and for   and  respectively 
provision for loan losses 
we recorded provisions for loan losses totaling million and million during and  respectively 
this provision was based on our estimate of the expected performance of our vacation ownership notes receivable  reduced by the estimated value of the underlying inventory that was anticipated to be recovered upon default 
effective january   sfas no 
requires that the estimated losses on originated vacation ownership mortgages exclude the benefit of an estimate for the value of future recoveries and further requires that the provision for loan losses for vacation ownership receivables be reflected as a reduction of voi sales 
accordingly  during our provision for loan losses of million was recorded as reduction of voi sales 
the and increases in the provision for loan losses during and  respectively  were primarily due to increases in bluegreen resorts sales  approximately of which were financed by us 
the increase in as compared to was also attributable to no longer accounting for the value of the future inventory recoveries as an offset to the provision for loan losses 
sfas no 
provides for the benefit of future inventory recoveries in the computation of cost of sales 
excluding the impact of sfas no 
 our provision for loan losses would have been million

minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
pre tax income for the subsidiary has increased over the periods presented as sales at the bluegreen wilderness club at big cedar have increased 
provision for income taxes

in march of  we received notice from the irs that our federal income tax return had been selected for examination 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net 
the adoption of sfas no 
on january  resulted in a net after tax charge of million  which is presented as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle primarily consists of the deferral of voi sales and related costs for sales that were previously recognized but did not meet the required down payment threshold at january   due to certain sales incentives provided to buyers and the treatment of our sampler program  and the related tax benefit  net of the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge related to the minority interest in the subsidiary 
summary 
based on the factors discussed above  our net income was million  million  and million for   and  respectively

cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million or from net cash inflows of million to a decrease of million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities during compared to was primarily driven by higher inventory acquisition and development spending and an increase in notes receivable due to increased voi sales 
during we acquired land for four bluegreen communities the bridges at preston crossing  king oaks  vintage oaks at the vineyard  and legacy oaks as well as three parcels of land for bluegreen resorts located in newland  north carolina  williamsburg  virginia  las vegas  nevada  and wisconsin dells  wisconsin 
partially offsetting the decrease in cash flows from operations was higher proceeds from the sale of notes receivable during  as compared to cash flows from operating activities decreased million or from net cash inflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this decrease was due primarily to higher construction and development spending during as compared to additionally  during we acquired land for three bluegreen communities developments saddle creek forest  the settlement at patriot ranch  and havenwood at hunter s crossing and three vacation ownership resorts daytona seabreeze  seaglass tower  and carolina grande  as compared to the acquisition of only one vacation ownership resort the suites at hershey and only two communities sugartree on the brazos and chapel ridge during these acquisition and related construction and development costs were paid with a combination of cash and borrowings 
we report cash flows from borrowings collateralized by notes receivable and sales of notes receivable as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the majority of bluegreen resorts sales result in the origination of notes receivable from its customers 
while subject to availability and market conditions  we believe that accelerating the conversion of such notes receivable into cash  either through the pledge or sale of our notes receivable  on a regular basis is an integral function of our operations  and have therefore classified such activities as operating activities 
cash flows from investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to net inflows of million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was due primarily to higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold 
this increase was partially offset by higher expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to cash flows used by investing activities decreased million or from net cash outflows of million to million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was due primarily to higher amounts of cash received in from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  as we did not begin receiving cash flows on our retained interest in a term securitization transaction until the third quarter of due to reserve funding requirements 
the remainder of the increase in cash flows from investing activities was due to lower expenditures in for property and equipment as compared to cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows used by financing activities decreased million or from net cash outflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in  we redeemed million of our senior secured notes 
additionally  we borrowed million in under our lines of credit compared to million in these cash flows were partially offset by the receipt of million of proceeds in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures in  as compared to the receipt of only million of such proceeds during cash flows used by financing activities increased million or from net cash outflows of million to million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
this increase was due primarily to the redemption of million of our senior secured notes as well as lower borrowings under our credit facilities during as compared to these outflows were partially offset by the receipt of million of cash in connection with our issuance of the junior subordinated debentures 
liquidity and capital resources our capital resources are provided from both internal and external sources 
our primary capital resources from internal operations are i cash sales  ii down payments on homesite and voi sales which are financed  iii proceeds from the sale of  or borrowings collateralized by  notes receivable  including cash received from our retained interests in notes receivable sold  iv principal and interest payments on the purchase money mortgage loans arising from sales of vois and homesites and v net cash generated from other resort services and other communities operations 
historically  external sources of liquidity have included non recourse sales of notes receivable  borrowings under secured and unsecured lines of credit  seller and bank financing of inventory acquisitions and the issuance of debt securities 
our capital resources are used to support our operations  including i acquiring and developing inventory  ii providing financing for customer purchases  iii funding operating expenses and iv satisfying our debt and other obligations 
as we are continually selling and marketing real estate vois and homesites  it is necessary for us to continually acquire and develop new resorts and communities in order to maintain adequate levels of inventory to support operations 
we anticipate that we will continue to require external sources of liquidity to support our operations  satisfy our debt and other obligations and to provide funds for growth 
our level of debt and debt service requirements have several important effects on our operations  including the following i we have significant cash requirements to service debt  reducing funds available for operations and future business opportunities and increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  ii our leveraged position increases our vulnerability to economic and competitive pressures  iii the financial covenants and other restrictions contained in the indentures  the credit agreements and other agreements relating to our indebtedness require us to meet certain financial tests and restrict our ability to  among other things  borrow additional funds  dispose of assets  make investments or pay cash dividends on  or repurchase  preferred or common stock  and iv funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and general corporate purposes may be limited 
certain of our competitors operate on a less leveraged basis and have greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
subject to the continued availability of financing and liquidity  we currently intend to continue to pursue a growth oriented strategy  particularly with respect to our bluegreen resorts business segment 
in connection with this strategy  we may from time to time acquire  among other things  additional resort properties and completed but unsold vois  land upon which additional resorts may be built  management contracts  loan portfolios of vacation ownership mortgages  portfolios which include properties or assets which may be integrated into our operations  interests in joint ventures  and operating companies providing or possessing management  sales  marketing  development  administration and or other expertise with respect to our operations in the vacation ownership industry 
in addition  we intend to continue to focus bluegreen communities activities on larger  more capital intensive projects particularly in those regions where we believe the market for our products is strongest  such as new golf communities in the southeast and other areas and continued growth in our successful regions in texas 
the following is a discussion of our purchase and credit facilities that were important sources of our liquidity as of december  these facilities do not constitute all of our outstanding indebtedness as of december  our other indebtedness includes outstanding senior secured notes payable  junior subordinated debentures  borrowings collateralized by real estate inventories that were not incurred pursuant to an ongoing credit facility and capital leases 
vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities off balance sheet arrangements our ability to sell and or borrow against our notes receivable from voi buyers is a critical factor in our continued liquidity 
when we sell vois  a financed buyer is only required to pay a minimum of of the purchase in cash at the time of sale  however  selling  marketing and administrative expenses are primarily cash expenses and  in our case for the year ended december   approximated of sales 
accordingly  having facilities available for the hypothecation or sale of these vacation ownership receivables is a critical factor to our ability to meet our short and long term cash needs 
the ge purchase facility 
in march  we executed agreements for a vacation ownership receivables purchase facility the ge purchase facility with general electric real estate ge 
the ge purchase facility utilizes an owner s trust structure  pursuant to which we sell receivables to bluegreen receivables finance corporation xi  our wholly owned  special purpose finance subsidiary brfc xi  and brfc xi sells the receivables to an owner s trust a qualified special purpose entity without recourse to us or brfc xi except for breaches of certain customary representations and warranties at the time of sale 
we did not enter into any guarantees in connection with the ge purchase facility 
the ge purchase facility has detailed requirements with respect to the eligibility of receivables for purchase  and fundings under the ge purchase facility are subject to certain conditions precedent 
under the ge purchase facility  a variable purchase price of approximately of the principal balance of the receivables sold  subject to adjustment under certain terms and conditions  is paid at closing in cash 
the balance of the purchase price is deferred until such time as ge has received a specified return  a specified overcollateralization ratio is achieved  a cash reserve account is fully funded and all servicing  custodial  agent and similar fees and expenses have been paid 
ge is entitled to receive a return equal to the applicable swap rate which is essentially a published interest swap arrangement rate as defined in the ge purchase facility agreements plus  subject to use of alternate return rates in certain circumstances 
in addition  we paid ge a structuring fee of approximately  in march  which is being amortized on a straight line basis through march subject to the terms of the agreements  we will act as servicer under the ge purchase facility for a fee 
the ge purchase facility includes various conditions to purchase  covenants  trigger events and other provisions customary for a transaction of this type 
ge s obligation to purchase under the ge purchase facility may terminate earlier than the dates noted above upon the occurrence of certain specified events set forth in the ge purchase facility agreements 
these specified events  some of which are subject to materiality qualifiers and cure periods  include  without limitation  i the aggregate amount of all advances under the ge purchase facility equaling million  ii our breach of the representations or warranties in the ge purchase facility  iii our failure to perform our covenants in the ge purchase facility  iv our commencement of bankruptcy or similar proceedings  v the amount of any advance under the ge purchase facility failing to meet a specified overcollateralization amount  vi significant delinquencies or defaults on the receivables sold  vii recovery rates falling below a pre determined amount  viii a default or breach under any other agreement beyond the applicable grace period if such default or breach a involves the failure to make a payment in excess of of our tangible net worth as defined in the ge purchase facility agreements to include our subordinated debentures or b causes  or permits the holder of indebtedness to cause  an amount in excess of of our tangible net worth to become due  ix our tangible net worth at the end of any calendar quarter not equaling at least million plus of net income following december   x the ratio of our debt excluding our subordinated debentures and receivable backed debt of no more than million to tangible net worth exceeding to  xi the ratio of our consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to our interest expense net of interest income falling below to  xii the number of points available in the bluegreen vacation club falling below approximately million points  xiii our ceasing to conduct the vacation ownership business or to originate vacation ownership receivables or if certain changes in our ownership or control occur  xiv the failure of certain of our resorts to be part of the bluegreen vacation club or be managed by us  one of our subsidiaries or another entity acceptable to ge  xv operating budgets and reserve accounts maintained by the property owners associations responsible for maintaining certain of our resorts failing to comply with applicable laws and governing documents  xvi our failure to discharge  stay or bond pending appeal any final judgments for the payment of an amount in excess of of our tangible net worth in a timely manner  xvii our default under or breach of certain resort management or marketing contracts  or xviii our failure to perform our servicing obligations  otherwise have our servicing rights terminated or if we do not exercise the servicer purchase option pursuant to the terms of the ge purchase facility 
the ge purchase facility allows for sales of notes receivable for a cumulative purchase price of up to million through march during  the company sold million in vacation ownership receivables under the ge purchase facility for an aggregate purchase price of million 
as of december   the remaining availability under the ge purchase facility was million in cumulative purchase price  subject to eligibility requirements and fulfillment of conditions precedent 
in january  we sold million in vacation ownership receivables under the ge purchase facility and received million in cash proceeds 
in march  we sold million of vacation ownership receivables under the same facility and received million in cash proceeds 
the ge purchase facility discussed above and the on balance sheet bb t purchase facility discussed under credit facilities for bluegreen resorts receivables and inventories are the only ongoing receivables purchase facilities under which we currently have the ability to sell or transfer receivables 
factors which could adversely impact our ability to obtain new or additional vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities include a downturn in general economic conditions  negative trends in the commercial paper or libor markets  increases in interest rates  a decrease in the number of financial institutions or other entities willing to enter into facilities with vacation ownership companies  a deterioration in the performance of our vacation ownership notes receivable or in the performance of portfolios sold in prior transactions  specifically increased delinquency  default and loss severity rates  and a deterioration in our performance generally 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain new purchase facilities or will be in a position to replace our existing purchase facilities when they are fully funded or expire 
as indicated above  our inability to sell vacation ownership receivables under a current or future facility could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity 
however  management believes that to the extent we could not sell receivables under a purchase facility  we could potentially mitigate the adverse impact on our liquidity by using our receivables as collateral under existing or future credit facilities 
we have historically chosen to monetize our receivables through the ge purchase facility and through periodic term securitization transactions  as these off balance sheet arrangements provide us with cash inflows both currently and in the future at what we believe to be competitive rates without adding leverage to our balance sheet or retaining recourse for losses on the receivables sold 
in addition  these sale transactions have generated gains on our income statement on a periodic basis  which would not be realized under a traditional financing arrangement 
historically  we have also been a party to a number of securitization type transactions  all of which in our opinion utilize customary structures and terms for transactions of this type 
in each securitization type transaction  we sold receivables to a wholly owned special purpose entity which  in turn  sold the receivables either directly to third parties or to a trust established for the transaction 
in each transaction  the receivables were sold on a non recourse basis except for breaches of certain representations and warranties and the special purpose entity has a retained interest in the receivables sold 
we have acted as servicer of the receivables pools in each transaction for a fee  with the servicing obligations specified under the applicable transaction documents 
under the terms of the applicable securitization transaction  the cash payments received from obligors on the receivables sold are distributed to the investors which  depending on the transaction  may acquire the receivables directly or purchase an interest in  or make loans secured by the receivables to  a trust that owns the receivables  parties providing services in connection with the facility  and our special purpose subsidiary as the holder of the retained interests in the receivables according to specified formulas 
in general  available funds are applied monthly to pay fees to service providers  make interest and principal payments to investors  fund required reserves  if any  and pay distributions in respect of the retained interests in the receivables 
pursuant to the terms of the transaction documents  however  to the extent the portfolio of receivables fails to satisfy specified performance criteria as may occur due to an increase in default rates or loan loss severity or other trigger events  the funds received from obligors are distributed on an accelerated basis to investors 
in effect  during a period in which the accelerated payment formula is applicable  funds go to outside investors until they receive the full amount owed to them and only then are payments made to our subsidiary in its capacity as the holder of the retained interests 
depending on the circumstances and the transaction  the application of the accelerated payment formula may be permanent or temporary until the trigger event is cured 
if the accelerated payment formula were to become applicable  the cash flow on the retained interests in the receivables would be reduced until the outside investors were paid or the regular payment formula was resumed 
such a reduction in cash flow could cause a decline in the fair value of our retained interests in the receivables sold 
declines in fair value that are determined to be other than temporary are charged to operations in the current period 
in each facility  the failure of the pool of receivables to comply with specified portfolio covenants can create a trigger event  which results in the use of the accelerated payment formula in certain circumstances until the trigger event is cured and in other circumstances permanently and  to the extent there was any remaining commitment to purchase receivables from our special purpose subsidiary  the suspension or termination of that commitment 
in addition  in each securitization facility certain breaches of our obligations as servicer or other events allow the indenture trustee to cause the servicing to be transferred to a substitute third party servicer 
in that case  our obligation to service the receivables would terminate and we would cease to receive a servicing fee 
we recognized an other than temporary decrease of  and  during and  respectively  in the fair value of our retained interest in a vacation ownership receivables securitization transaction  based on higher than projected default rates in the portfolio sold

the gmac communities facility is secured by the real property homesites and personal property related thereto at the following bluegreen communities projects  as well as any bluegreen communities projects acquired by us with funds borrowed under the gmac communities facility the secured projects brickshire new kent county  virginia  mountain lakes ranch bluffdale  texas  ridge lake shores magnolia  texas  riverwood forest fulshear  texas  waterstone boerne  texas  catawba falls preserve black mountain  north carolina  lake ridge at joe pool lake cedar hill and grand prairie  texas  mystic shores at canyon lake spring branch  texas  yellowstone creek ranch walsenburg  colorado  havenwood at hunter s crossing new braunfels  texas  the bridges at preston crossing grayson county  texas  king oaks college station  texas and vintage oaks at the vineyard new braunfels  texas 
in addition  the gmac communities facility is secured by our carolina national and the preserve at jordan lake golf courses in southport  north carolina and chapel hill  north carolina  respectively 
principal payments are effected through agreed upon release prices paid to rfc  as homesites in the secured projects are sold 
interest payments are due monthly 
the gmac communities facility includes customary conditions to funding  acceleration and event of default provisions and certain financial affirmative and negative covenants 
we use the proceeds from the gmac communities facility to repay outstanding indebtedness on bluegreen communities projects  finance the acquisition and development of bluegreen communities projects and for general corporate purposes 
in february  the company acquired acres near st 
simons island  georgia  for million for a property to be called sanctuary river club at st 
andrews sound 
the company borrowed million under the gmac communities facility in connection with the acquisition of this property 
over the past several years  substantially all of our homesite sales have been for cash and we have not provided a significant amount of financing to homesite purchasers 
accordingly  in recent years we have reduced the borrowing capacity under credit agreements secured by bluegreen communities receivables 
we attribute the significant volume of cash sales to an increased willingness on the part of banks to extend direct customer homesite financing at attractive interest rates 
no assurances can be given that local banks will continue to provide such customer financing 
historically  we have funded development for road and utility construction  amenities  surveys and engineering fees from internal operations and have financed the acquisition of bluegreen communities properties through seller  bank or financial institution loans 
terms for repayment under these loans typically call for interest to be paid monthly and principal to be repaid through homesite releases 
the release price is usually an amount based on a pre determined percentage typically to of the gross selling price of the homesites in the subdivision 
in addition  the agreements generally call for minimum cumulative amortization periodically 
when we provide financing to our customers and therefore the release price is not available in cash at closing to repay the lender  we are required to pay the lender with cash derived from other operating activities  principally from cash sales or the pledge of receivables originated from earlier property sales 
trust preferred securities offerings we have formed statutory business trusts collectively  the trusts and each issued trust preferred securities and invested the proceeds thereof in our junior subordinated debentures 
the trusts are variable interest entities in which we are not the primary beneficiary as defined by fasb interpretation no 
r 
accordingly  we do not consolidate the operations of the trusts  instead  the trusts are accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
in each of these transactions  the applicable trust issued trust preferred securities as part of larger pooled trust securities offerings which were not registered under the securities act of the applicable trust then used the proceeds from issuing the trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities are payable quarterly in arrears at the same interest rate 
distributions on the trust preferred securities are cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the junior subordinated debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at the company s option at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  we made an initial equity contribution to each trust in exchange for its common securities  all of which are owned by us  and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the terms of each trust s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities

on february   a newly formed wholly owned statutory business trust  bluegreen statutory trust vi bst vi  issued million of trust preferred securities 
bst vi used the proceeds from issuing the trust preferred securities to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
interest on the junior subordinated debentures and distributions on the trust preferred securities will be payable quarterly in arrears at a fixed rate of through april  and thereafter at a floating rate of over the month libor until the scheduled maturity date of april  distributions on the trust preferred securities will be cumulative and based upon the liquidation value of the trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities will be subject to mandatory redemption  in whole or in part  upon repayment of the junior subordinated debentures at maturity or their earlier redemption 
the junior subordinated debentures are redeemable at any time after five years from the issue date or sooner following certain specified events 
in addition  we contributed  to bst vi in exchange for its common securities  all of which are owned by us  and those proceeds were also used to purchase an identical amount of junior subordinated debentures from us 
the terms of bst vi s common securities are nearly identical to the trust preferred securities 
proceeds of the offering will be used for general corporate purposes and debt repayment 
we currently intend to seek to create similar trusts and to participate in other pooled trust preferred securities transactions in the future as a source of additional financing  subject to market conditions and other considerations 
unsecured credit facility on july   we executed agreements to renew our million unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na amounts borrowed under the line bear interest at day libor plus at december  
interest is due monthly and all outstanding amounts are due on june  we can only borrow an amount under the line of credit which is less than the remaining availability under our current  active vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities plus availability under certain receivables warehouse facilities  less any outstanding letters of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants and conditions typical of arrangements of this type 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under the line 
however  during  an aggregate of  of irrevocable letters of credit were provided under this line of credit which were required in connection with the obtaining of plats for one of our bluegreen communities projects 
on december    of these letters of credit expired and were not renewed 
this line of credit is an available source of short term liquidity for us 
during  we borrowed and repaid million under this line of credit 
commitments our material commitments as of december   included the required payments due on our receivable backed debt  lines of credit and other notes payable  commitments to complete our vacation ownership  and communities projects based on our sales contracts with customers and commitments under noncancelable operating leases

assumes that interest on variable rate debt has assumed the interest rate remains the same as the rate at december  we intend to use cash flow from operations  including cash received from the sale of vacation ownership notes receivable  and cash received from new borrowings under existing or future debt facilities in order to satisfy the principal payments required on contractual obligations 
while we believe that we will be able to meet all required debt payments when due  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
as noted above  during we had  in letters of credit outstanding  the majority of which were issued under the unsecured line of credit with wachovia bank  na these letters of credit were required in connection with the obtaining of governmental approval of plats for one of our bluegreen communities projects 
on december    of these letters of credit expired 
we estimate that the total cash required to complete resort buildings in which sales have occurred and resort amenities and other common costs in projects in which sales have occurred to be approximately million as of december  we estimate that the total cash required to complete our bluegreen communities projects in which sales have occurred to be approximately million as of december  these amounts assume that we are not obligated to develop any building  project or amenity in which a commitment has not been made through a sales contract to a customer  however  we anticipate that we will incur such obligations in the future 
we plan to fund these expenditures over the next five years primarily with available capacity on existing or proposed credit facilities and cash generated from operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing or generate the cash from operations necessary to complete the foregoing plans or that actual costs will not exceed those estimated 
we believe that our existing cash  anticipated cash generated from operations  anticipated future permitted borrowings under existing or proposed credit facilities and anticipated future sales of notes receivable under the purchase facilities and one or more replacement facilities we will seek to put in place will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
we will be required to renew or replace credit and receivables purchase facilities that have expired or that will expire in the near term 
we will  in the future  also require additional credit facilities or will be required to issue corporate debt or equity securities in connection with acquisitions or otherwise 
any debt incurred or issued by us may be secured or unsecured  bear fixed or variable rate interest and may be subject to such terms as the lender may require and management believes acceptable 
there can be no assurance that the credit facilities or receivables purchase facilities which have expired or which are scheduled to expire in the near term will be renewed or replaced or that sufficient funds will be available from operations or under existing  proposed or future revolving credit or other borrowing arrangements or receivables purchase facilities to meet our cash needs  including  our debt service obligations 
to the extent we are not able to sell notes receivable or borrow under such facilities  our ability to satisfy our obligations would be materially adversely affected 
most of our credit facilities  indentures  and other outstanding debt instruments  and receivables purchase facilities include customary conditions to funding  eligibility requirements for collateral  cross default and other acceleration provisions  certain financial and other affirmative and negative covenants  including  among others  limits on the incurrence of indebtedness  limits on the repurchase of securities  restrictions on the payment of dividends  investments in joint ventures and other restricted payments  limitations on the incurrence of liens and transactions with affiliates  covenants concerning net worth  fixed charge coverage requirements  debt to equity ratios and portfolio performance requirements  and events of default or termination 
no assurance can be given that we will be in compliance with such covenants  that we will not be required to seek waivers of such covenants or that such covenants will not limit our ability to raise funds  sell receivables  satisfy or refinance our obligations or otherwise adversely affect our operations 
in addition  our future operating performance and ability to meet our financial obligations will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  many of which will be beyond our control 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
foreign currency risk our total revenues and net assets denominated in a currency other than us dollars during the year ended december  were less than of consolidated revenues and consolidated assets  respectively 
sales generated by bluegreen properties  nv  our subsidiary in aruba  are transacted in us dollars 
the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates have not historically been significant to our operations or net assets 
interest rate risk we sold million  million  and million of fixed rate vacation ownership notes receivable off balance sheet during  and  respectively  under various vacation ownership receivable purchase facilities and term securitization transactions see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
our gains on sale recognized are generally based upon either fixed or variable interest rates at the time of sale including the prevailing weighted average term treasury rate  commercial paper rates or libor rates depending on the purchase facility in effect and many other factors including  but not limited to the weighted average coupon rate and remaining contractual life of the loans sold  and assumptions regarding the constant prepayment rate  loss severity  annual default and discount rates 
we believe that we have used appropriate assumptions in valuing the residual interests retained in the vacation ownership notes sold through our various off balance sheet vacation ownership receivables purchase facilities and term securitization transactions and that such assumptions should mitigate the impact of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on these valuations  but there is no assurance that the assumptions will prove to be correct 
as of december   we had fixed interest rate debt of approximately million and floating interest rate debt of approximately million 
in addition  our notes receivable from voi and homesite customers were comprised of million of fixed rate loans and million of notes bearing floating interest rates 
the floating interest rates are based either upon the prevailing prime or libor interest rates 
for floating rate financial instruments  interest rate changes do not generally affect the market value of debt but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
conversely  for fixed rate financial instruments  interest rate changes affect the market value of the debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prevailing prime or libor rates  as applicable  would  as a result of increased interest expense on variable rate debt  decrease our after tax earnings by an immaterial amount per year  partially offset by the increased interest income on variable rate bluegreen communities notes receivable and cash and cash equivalents 
a similar change in interest rates would decrease the total fair value of our fixed rate debt  excluding our senior secured notes payable the notes by an immaterial amount 
the fact that the notes are publicly traded in the over the counter market makes it impractical to estimate the effect of the hypothetical change in interest rates on the fair value of the notes 
due to the non interest related factors involved in determining the fair value of these publicly traded securities  their fair values have historically demonstrated increased  decreased or at times contrary relationships to changes in interest rates as compared to other types of fixed rate debt securities 
the analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  we would likely attempt to take actions to mitigate any exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
