item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales 
abbott s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  nutritional products  vascular products and diagnostic testing products 
abbott also owns percent of tap pharmaceutical products inc that abbott accounts for on the equity method 
the worldwide launch of humira  the acquisition of guidant s vascular business  the amendment of the boehringer ingelheim agreement  and the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products have impacted abbott s sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology  oncology  neuroscience  metabolism  and viral diseases 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira  which increased its worldwide sales to billion in compared to billion in substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of humira 
in december  abbott acquired kos pharmaceuticals which complements abbott s existing franchise in the dyslipidemia market and strengthens the late stage and mid term pharmaceutical pipeline with opportunities in cholesterol management  asthma and inhaled insulin 
in  abbott and boehringer ingelheim bi amended their agreement whereby abbott distributed and promoted bi products 
effective january   abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the bi products 
abbott s gross margins for bi products from the prior agreement in effect through december  were substantially lower than its average gross margins 
sales of bi products were million and billion in and  respectively 
in addition  increased generic competition resulted in worldwide sales of clarithromycin declining percent in in and  abbott s nutritional products businesses were reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands 
significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities  particularly in developing markets 
in april  abbott acquired guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and began to integrate it with abbott s vascular business 
the acquisition significantly improved abbott s competitive position in this business that is characterized by rapid innovation 
in  abbott received european union approval to market the xience v drug eluting stent 
abbott s diagnostic segment is comprised of four separate divisions immunoassay hematology  diabetes care  molecular  and point of care 
in early  abbott acquired therasense for billion  and began to integrate it with abbott s diabetes care business 
in january  abbott announced that it had agreed to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business  including abbott point of care  to ge for billion in cash 
abbott expects the sale to close in the first half of abbott s molecular diagnostics and diabetes care businesses are not part of this transaction and will remain part of abbott 
abbott s short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely incurred to finance recent acquisitions 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have allowed abbott to fund acquisitions over the last three years 
at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s corporation and a by moody s investors service 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the pharmaceutical business  abbott will continue the launch of newly approved indications for humira  and will also focus on the integration of kos pharmaceuticals into the pharmaceutical products segment 
pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus on the therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new humira indications 
abbott expects to submit additional pharmaceutical regulatory filings in in the vascular business  abbott will continue the launch of the xience v drug eluting stent in europe  and will launch in the us upon approval by the fda 
for diabetes care  abbott anticipates the approval of freestyle navigator 
effort will also be required for the sale and separation of abbott s core laboratory and point of care diagnostics businesses 
in the other business segments  abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates approximately percent of abbott s consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 
most of these rebates and allowances are in the pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  to state agencies that administer the federal medicaid and medicare programs and the special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government agencies and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government agency price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in  and amounted to approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  or percent  percent and percent  respectively  based on gross sales of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  subject to rebate 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately million in other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott s historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter 
in the domestic nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management internally estimates the inventory in the retail channel that is not on the retail shelf 
a third party continuously measures time on the retail shelf  which is a relatively significant portion of the time inventory is in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business  the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably estimable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market surveys 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   abbott had the exclusive wic business in states 
in the domestic pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott s systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are reliable 
the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in thousands domestic pharmaceutical products domestic nutritionals wic rebates medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  adjustments for prior years rebate accruals have not been material 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid  medicare and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
as part of abbott s calculation of the provision for taxes on earnings  abbott records the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
each quarter  abbott reviews its exposures in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in the us  abbott s federal income tax returns through are settled  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
except for taxes on dividends that were remitted under the american jobs creation act of  abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
on january   abbott must adopt the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes which changes the measurement of tax contingencies 
under this interpretation  in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit  the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position  and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
this interpretation will result in significantly more effort to assess tax uncertainties than was required under sfas no 
 and may result in initial recording of tax expense that exceeds the expected resolution of tax uncertainties 
the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on abbott s january  balance sheet or the provision for income taxes 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs 
abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rate  discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rates used to measure liabilities as of december  and were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits 
prior to december   the discount rate was determined by reference to a composite corporate aa bond index 
the health care cost trend rate represents abbott s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
recent low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were billion and million  respectively 
actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
footnote to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
on december   abbott adopted the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the provisions of this statement require the immediate recognition of the deferrals on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
adoption of this statement on december  resulted in a decrease in abbott s shareholders equity of approximately billion 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows  risk  the cost of capital  and terminal values 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs 
at december  goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to million in there were no impairments of goodwill in  or at december  the valuations for the guidant and kos acquisitions have not been finalized 
litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
except for one group of cases relating to pharmaceutical pricing for which abbott is unable to estimate a loss  if any  abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures 
reserves of approximately million have been recorded at december  for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management s best estimate of probable loss  as defined by sfas no 
stock compensation through december   abbott measured compensation cost using the intrinsic value based method of accounting for stock options granted to employees and disclosed the impact of the fair value method in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   abbott adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that fair value be recorded in the results of operations 
since there is no market for trading employee stock options  management must use a fair value method 
there is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash 
fair value methods require management to make several assumptions  the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model  stock price volatility and the average life of an option 
abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions 
abbott uses the black scholes method to value stock options 
the results of the black scholes model are periodically compared to the binomial model and the results have been comparable 
abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of currently traded options to develop the volatility assumptions 
abbott uses the historical grant activity  combined with expectations about future exercise activity  to develop the average life assumptions 
abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders 
abbott quantified the additional paid in capital amount available for use in determining tax effects of early exercise for measurement of tax expense 
abbott used the modified prospective method of adoption 
under this method  prior years financial results do not include the impact of recording stock options using fair value 
footnote quantifies the effect in and had compensation cost been determined using the fair value method

a the pharmaceutical products segment had an agreement with boehringer ingelheim bi to co promote and distribute three of its products in the us in  abbott and bi amended the agreement and effective january   abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the bi products 
the increases in sales for excluding bi products were percent for total net sales  percent for total us sales and percent for pharmaceutical products segment sales

percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 
percent change percent change percent change dollars in millions pharmaceuticals us specialty us primary care international pharmaceuticals diagnostics immunoassay diabetes care nutritionals us pediatric nutritionals international pediatric nutritionals us adult nutritionals international adult nutritionals increased sales volume of humira and increased volume and price for kaletra and depakote favorably impacted us specialty sales 
increased sales volume for tricor and omnicef favorably impacted us primary care sales and were partially offset by lower us sales of biaxin due primarily to generic competition for the immediate release formulation 
us sales of biaxin were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
increased sales volume of humira favorably impacted international pharmaceuticals sales  partially offset by decreased sales volume in due to generic competition for clarithromycin 
diabetes care product sales growth in and was favorably impacted by the acquisition of therasense in the second quarter of the decrease in sales of us pediatric nutritionals in was primarily due to overall infant nutritionals non wic category decline and competitive share loss 
international pediatric nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries 
us adult nutritionals sales in and were favorably impacted by the acquisition of eas in the fourth quarter of abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott s revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
related net sales were million in  million in and million in the expiration of licenses  patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
significant ongoing generic activities  and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows 
the us composition of matter patent for depakote expires in abbott holds non composition of matter patents on the extended release form of depakote 
us sales of depakote in were billion 
in  the fda granted approval for generic competition to synthroid and generic competitors have entered the market 
us sales of synthroid were million in and million in clarithromycin is now subject to generic competition in most european markets 
european market sales of clarithromycin in and were million and million  respectively 
in the us  clarithromycin is marketed in two forms  the immediate release and the extended release forms 
in may  the composition of matter patent on clarithromycin expired  and several immediate release generic products were launched by competitors 
abbott holds non composition of matter patents for the extended release form of clarithromycin 
in december  an extended release generic product was launched by a competitor 
the us district court of the northern district of illinois has denied abbott s request for grant of a temporary restraining order against the competitor 
there may be further generic competition for clarithromycin in other countries in depending on the results of legal proceedings related to the patents 
upon the december expiration of a court order related to licenses for sevoflurane  baxter is now permitted to market a competitive form of sevoflurane 
in addition  sevoflurane has been subject to generic competition from other competitors in isolated markets outside of the us and further generic competition in international markets is possible 
worldwide sales of sevoflurane in and were million and million  respectively 
the composition of matter patent for omnicef expires in may abbott holds an additional non composition of matter patent for omnicef 
sales of omnicef in and were million and million  respectively 
the pharmaceutical products segment markets all of the above products 
the patent for prevacid  which is licensed by tap pharmaceuticals tap  expires in abbott records tap s results on the equity method 
operating earnings gross profit margins were percent of net sales in  percent in and percent in the increase in the gross profit margin in was due to favorable product mix  primarily as a result of decreased sales of boehringer ingelheim products that have lower margins than for other products in the pharmaceutical products segment and the decrease in the gross profit margin in was due to unfavorable product mix  primarily as a result of increased sales of boehringer ingelheim products 
restructuring charges  discussed below  reduced the gross profit margins in and by percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
the gross profit margin in was impacted by the favorable mix effect of exchange on the gross profit margin and by unfavorable product mix  primarily increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products in the pharmaceutical products segment 
gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements  higher project expenses for new products  higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth and the effects of inflation 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and pharmaceutical products segments 
in addition  pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the nutritional products segment in  and the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were favorably impacted in and unfavorably impacted in and by product mix 
the favorable product mix in was due to decreased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and the unfavorable product mix in and was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs 
research and development expense  excluding acquired in process and collaborations research and development  was billion in  billion in and billion in and represented increases of percent in  percent in and percent in the effect of recording compensation expense relating to share based awards and additional costs associated with abbott s decision to discontinue the commercial development of the zomaxx drug eluting stent increased research and development expenses by percentage points over the remaining increase was due to the acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and increased spending to support pipeline programs  including follow on indications for humira  and other late stage clinical programs in pharmaceuticals  diabetes care and vascular 
the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to increases of percent in and percent in includes the effect of recording compensation expense relating to share based awards  a philanthropic contribution to the abbott fund and the acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses 
these items increased selling  general and administrative expenses by percentage points over the restructuring charges discussed below and an increase in a bad debt reserve associated with an unfavorable court ruling increased the percent change from by percentage points in in  abbott recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses  a pretax charge of million related to a settlement 
this charge reduced the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses by percentage points for the remaining increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products  including continued spending for humira  as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products 
these increases also reflect the effects of the acquisitions of therasense and eas in increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the pharmaceutical products segment 
restructurings dollars in millions in and  abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs 
in and  abbott recorded pretax charges against earnings of approximately and  respectively  reflecting the impairment of manufacturing facilities and other assets  employee severance and other related charges 
approximately and  respectively  is classified as cost of products sold  and  respectively  as research and development and  in  as selling  general and administrative 
an additional and were subsequently recorded in and  respectively  relating to these restructurings  primarily for accelerated depreciation

net interest expense net interest expense increased in due primarily to higher borrowings as a result of the acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses  and abbott s investments in the common stock of boston scientific and a note receivable  partially offset by higher interest income 
other income expense  net the increase in other income expense in is primarily due to fair value gain adjustments to certain derivative financial instruments related to the investment in boston scientific common stock 
taxes on earnings the effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations were percent in  percent in and percent in taxes on earnings in reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in process and collaborations research and development and the resolution of prior years income tax audits and the effect of discrete tax events 
for  the tax rates applied to acquired in process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and discrete tax events decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
in  abbott remitted billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of and recorded additional tax expense of million  which increased the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
this was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements  which decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
the effective tax rate for reflects adjustments of prior years tax requirements primarily as a result of resolutions of prior years tax audits and the effect of non deductible acquired in process research and development 
the effect of these items for was to decrease the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of approximately percent in spin off of abbott s core hospital products business in  abbott s board of directors declared a special dividend distribution of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of hospira  inc  payable on april  hospira included the operations relating to the manufacture and sale of hospital products including specialty injectable pharmaceuticals  medication delivery systems and critical care devices and injectable pharmaceutical contract manufacturing 
hospira included abbott s hospital products segment  after that segment s reorganization on january   and portions of the former international segment

in order to facilitate boston scientific s acquisition of guidant  abbott also acquired million shares of boston scientific common stock directly from boston scientific and loaned million to a wholly owned subsidiary of boston scientific 
abbott is required to dispose of the shares by october sales of the shares are limited to approximately million shares per month until october the amount recorded upon the acquisition of the shares includes a discount to market  based on an appraisal  to reflect the value of the restrictions on sale 
on the date of acquisition  half of the shares were recorded as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
and the remainder under the cost method in accordance with apb no 
as of december   all of the shares are recorded as available for sale in accordance with sfas no 
the loan  which is due in april  is guaranteed by boston scientific and bears a favorable effective interest rate of percent  which is reflected in the valuation of the note receivable 
in connection with the acquisition of the shares  boston scientific is entitled to certain after tax gains upon abbott s sale of the shares 
abbott would retain any gains on the sale of the boston scientific shares up to a sales price of  boston scientific would receive any after tax gains on the sale of the shares for the portion of the sales price in excess of but lower than  and boston scientific would receive one half of any after tax gain for the portion of the sales price in excess of 
based on an appraisal  abbott recorded approximately million for this gain sharing derivative financial instrument liability 
in addition  boston scientific agreed to reimburse abbott for certain borrowing costs on debt incurred to acquire the boston scientific shares 
after abbott incurs the first million of interest cost on debt incurred to acquire the shares  boston scientific will reimburse abbott for the next million of interest cost 
reimbursement for the incremental interest cost will be in the form of additional common stock of boston scientific  payable months after the acquisition 
abbott recorded approximately million for this interest derivative financial instrument asset 
the effect of recording the shares  the loan to boston scientific and the derivative financial instruments at fair value on the date of acquisition resulted in the recording of additional goodwill of approximately million 
the financial assets and liability acquired from boston scientific were valued and recorded at acquisition as follows in millions of dollars boston scientific common stock note receivable derivative financial instruments  net total in  abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company that was previously accounted for under the equity method of accounting and a less than percent equity interest in a small medical products company 
the aggregate cash purchase price was approximately million 
acquisition accounting resulted in the recording of non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million  intangible assets of approximately million and a charge of approximately million for acquired in process research and development 
in  abbott acquired additional rights related to humira for approximately million  which are being amortized over years 
in  abbott acquired therasense  inc  a leader in the development  manufacturing and marketing of blood glucose self monitoring systems  for approximately billion in cash  i stat corporation  a manufacturer of point of care diagnostic products for blood analysis  for approximately million in cash  eas  a nutritional company with a portfolio of nationally recognized brands  for approximately million in cash  and spine next  a manufacturer of orthopedic spinal implant devices  for approximately million in cash plus additional milestone payments of up to million upon achievement of future targets 
abbott also acquired certain other product technologies for approximately million 
these acquisitions resulted in a charge of million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of approximately billion  non tax deductible goodwill of approximately million and deferred income taxes of approximately million 
acquired intangible assets  primarily trade names  are amortized over to years average of approximately years

subsequent event announced sales of businesses on january   abbott announced that it had agreed to sell its core laboratory diagnostics business  including abbott point of care  to ge for billion in cash 
the sale is expected to close in the first half of and is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approvals 
the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities included in the sale is estimated to be approximately billion and net sales for these businesses were approximately billion in abbott estimates tax expense of approximately billion will be recorded on the gain 
financial condition cash flow net cash from operating activities of continuing operations amounted to billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase in cash from operating activities in compared to is due to higher net earnings adjusted for after tax non cash charges for acquired in process research and development and share based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in compared to  partially offset by higher income tax payments in  including tax payments related to the remittances of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act 
in  and  million  million and million  respectively  was contributed to the main domestic defined benefit plan 
abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of million annually 
the increased contribution in was due  in part  to the investment of cash remitted under the american jobs creation act of abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott s capital expenditures and cash dividends
