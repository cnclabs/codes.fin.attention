critical accounting policies in general our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies detailed in footnote to the company s consolidated financials statements contained herein  those dealing with valuation of securities and other assets  revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts receivable involve a particularly high degree of judgment and complexity 
our accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important to understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
off balance sheet risk we execute securities transactions on behalf of our customers 
if either the customer or a counter party fails to perform  we  by agreement with our clearing broker  may be required to discharge the obligations of the non performing party 
in such circumstances  we may sustain a loss if the market value of the security is different from the contract value of the transaction 
we seek to control off balance sheet risk by monitoring the market value of securities held or given as collateral in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
pursuant to such guidelines  our clearing firm requires that we reduce positions when necessary 
we also complete credit evaluations where there is thought to be credit risk 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an employee or representative of the company  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual costs upon disposition of a legal proceeding could be greater or less than the reserved amount 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  risk management risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
risk management is critical to the company s financial strength and profitability and requires robust auditing  constant communications  judgment and knowledge of financial trends and the economy as a whole 
senior management takes an active role in the risk management process 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  operational  regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk attributable to common macroeconomic factors such as gross domestic product  employment  inflation  interest rates  budget deficits and consumer sentiment 
consumer and producer sentiment is critical to our business 
the level of consumer confidence determines their willingness to spend  especially in the financial markets 
it is this willingness to spend in the financial markets that is key to our business 
a shift in spending in this area could negatively impact us 
however  senior management is constantly monitoring these economic trends in order to enhance our product line to offset any potential negative impact 
operational risk operational risk refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
managing these risks is critical  especially in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volume 
failure to manage these risks could result in material financial loss to the company 
to mitigate these risks  the company had developed specific policies and procedures designed to identify and manage operational risk 
these policies and procedures are reviewed and updated on a continuing basis to ensure that this risk is minimized 
regulatory and legal risk regulatory and legal risk includes non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements and the risk of a large number of customer claims that could result in adverse judgments against the company 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in all jurisdictions in which it operates 
in this regard  the company has instituted comprehensive procedures to address issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
however  as evidenced by the bringing of the now settled massachusetts proceedings and other legal proceedings see part i  item legal proceedings  there can be no assurances that such compliance procedures will prevent future regulatory and legal proceedings  the outcomes and consequences of which cannot now be reasonably foreseen or quantified 
effects of inflation the company s assets primarily are liquid in nature and not significantly affected by inflation 
management believes that the replacement cost of property and equipment will not materially affect operating results 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  communications and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided 
key indicators of financial performance management periodically reviews and analyzes our financial performance across a number of measurable factors considered to be particularly useful in understanding and managing our business 
key page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  metrics in this process include average production per representative  top line commission and advisory services revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  legal costs  earnings per share  and average revenue per representative 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march average production per representative management believes that upgrading the overall quality of our independent representatives is a key to achieving robust growth in revenues and net income 
our experience has been that increasing the average technical qualifications and business practices of our representatives not only generates more revenue  but assists in limiting the cost of overhead functions and representative errors or misconduct 
we strive to continually improve the overall quality of our force of representatives by recruiting higher quality new representatives  terminating lower quality representatives  and assisting existing representatives to improve their skills and practices 
a key metric that we use to assess the average quality of our representatives is average revenue generated per representative 
average revenue per representative increased by  reflecting management s continuing emphasis on recruiting established and successful representatives 
we look forward to a continuation of this trend as we maintain our efforts to increase the average productivity of our existing sales force and to recruit representatives who are already successful but seek a higher level of service than they experience from their existing brokerage firms

while we are gratified by continued growth in high margin lines of business  such as trading and advisory services  we also value the diversification of our brokerage revenues sources provided by even greater growth  compared to trading services  in revenues from mutual funds  variable annuities and direct participation programs 
much like a diversified client portfolio  management believes a diversified revenue stream provides a degree of protection from market risk

commission revenue variable annuities   trading brokerage    mutual funds    direct participation programs   other    total commission revenue   revenue designated as trading brokerage includes revenue from mutual funds sold through our trading platform 
commissions from variable annuities continue to comprise the largest component of commission revenue 
commissions in direct participation programs grew primarily as a result of increased sales volume in the oil and gas programs 
over recent periods  trading revenue generally has maintained its share of the revenue as commissions from brokerage comprises the second largest component of commission revenue for the current period 
supporting this historical trend is our recruitment and retention of representatives who conduct transactional business as well as utilization of our clearing firm s trading platform to enable us to conduct more brokerage business in an efficient fashion 
the recent trend of higher growth in fee based advisory services compared to commission based services reflects concerted efforts by management to grow revenues in the higher margin advisory services area 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  advisory fees advisory services typically provide significantly higher margins than traditional non trading broker dealer products such as variable annuities and mutual funds 
see gross margins 
accordingly  we have been encouraging our representatives to transition more of their non trading business to advisory services 
although we do not dictate the nature or extent of advisory services our representatives provide for their clients  we continue to make concerted efforts to attract them to our proprietary advisory services programs through education  seminars  trade shows and direct telemarketing 
fees from our rep directed asset managed a map program  where asset allocation and other investment advisory services are provided directly by our independent representatives  continue to be the leading source of revenue in this category 
revenues from this program  which have been contributing an increasing proportion of advisory services revenue  grew by million or to million compared to million for the prior period 
supported by our net exchange pro and pershing direct on line mainframe trading platforms  this program is popular with our representatives because of the opportunities it provides to deliver to their clients superior asset management services at a potentially lower cost  and the potential for increased overall investment performance 
resulting transactional cost savings have been passed on to our representatives clients in the form of lower fees for improved service 
other fee income other fee income  primarily comprised of licensing and financial planning fees  decreased by when comparing the current period to the prior period 
this decrease stems mostly from less licensing revenues because of fewer registered representatives 
marketing revenue net marketing revenues increased by due to the increase in marketing support as a result of increased sales in the sponsorship company s products 
other income other income  consisting primarily of interest and dividends and gains losses on investments  increased by 
the majority of the increase came from interest earned on account balances due to an increase in the average daily balance in our trading accounts

management during fiscal year end march  tracked all advisory services as one aggregate for gross margin reporting purposes 
in fiscal year ended march  management switched to tracking the a map rep direct program separately from other advisory services programs 
gross margin rose by million or to million for the current period primarily due to a million or increase in gross margin derived from our check and application programs 
also contributing to this rise was a million or increase from trading 
check and application the increase in gross margin from our check and application business came directly from an increase in sales volume of the variable annuity and direct participation components 
as a result of a million increase in sales from these product types  we achieved an increase of approximately million in our profit margin in comparing the current period to the prior period 
please refer to the above commission revenue chart 
profit margins from mutual fund sales  variable annuity sales  direct participation programs and other page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  check and application distribution programs generated million or nearly of the total gross margin compared to million or during the prior period 
as reflected in the above gross margin table  margin from our check and application distribution programs comprised the greatest portion of our overall profit margin  with profit margin from trading being the next leading component among our principal categories 
investments in technology have allowed us to process this additional volume without adding a commensurate level of staff 
advisory services the company s continued emphasis on the a map  our rep directed asset managed program  is clearly reflected in our gross margin table as gross margin increased by million or 
this gross margin improvement resulted directly from growth in assets under management in the program which  in management s opinion  is due primarily to lower fees  improved services and increased awareness of this program 
management s primary focus in the advisory services program has been to increase assets under management in the belief that it will generate an increase in the overall profit margin in advisory services even though the percentage retention rate may decrease as a result of lower fee rates 
although our retention rate from advisory services decreased compared to the prior period  it continues to exceed the rates generated by most of the other products and services we and our representatives provide 
see gross margin table  above 
management s emphasis on delivering our a map program is reflected in the gross margin table with a concomitant million  or  decrease in gross margin in other advisory services including the older wrap fee programs 
trading services trading services profit margin increased by million or due primarily to a million increase in the margin from our fees on account balances 
these fees contribute directly to our profit margin as they require no commission payout 
in addition  there was a million increase in gross margins from trading activities that required a commission payout 
as a result of the million increase to our profit margin from non commissionable fees on account balances  our payouts as a percentage of total trading revenue remained relatively flat for the comparative periods  however  payouts  as a percentage of commissionable trading  increased 
although our margin retention decreased slightly from in the prior period to in the current period  trading services remain the second largest component of revenue contributing to our gross margin 
despite a slight downward trend  the percentage retention rates generated by trading services and advisory services continue to exceed those generated by our check and application business 
we intend to continue recruiting representatives who are duly licensed and otherwise capable of offering trading and advisory services to their clients 
payout and retention rates payouts to our independent representatives combined with other advisory and trading services costs  as a percentage of revenue generated by them  increased to compared to for the prior period 
the corresponding decrease in our overall retention rate from to reflects a continuing transitioning of our sales force to higher producing representatives that command correspondingly higher payout rates see part i  item i our process which was partially offset by a net increase in fees that do not generate payouts 
in addition to selling more products through our check and application distribution programs  higher quality representatives have the potential to positively influence our overall retention rate because they are licensed to sell more of the higher margin products such as trading and advisory services 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  management carefully monitors our retention rates  however  we have chosen to focus more on total dollars retained 
management believes that  on average  increased payout rates earned by higher producing representatives will be more than offset by greater overall contributions to margin and increased firm profitability 
management is continuing their efforts to improve margin contribution by recruiting and retaining sophisticated representatives who are duly licensed to offer a variety of brokerage and advisory products and services that generate higher commission retention rates than those obtained from check and application products 
we experienced higher margins from trading as a result of ticket charges and fees pertaining to increases in account balances that flow entirely to the profit margin 
with respect to advisory services  we receive fees on asset account balances that flow directly to the firm 
refer to note revenue recognition advisory fees to our condensed consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses operating expenses  which experienced a million or increase  are discussed in detail below 
compensation and benefits the largest component of operating expenses is compensation and benefits  which increased by million or 
general salaries  which grew by  accounted for million of the increase 
in addition  we experienced a million increase in compensation paid to officers resulting from bonuses 
another significant contribution to the increase was a million increase in stock compensation in the form of restricted stock awards to employees  directors  consultants and independent representatives 
the increase in general salaries resulted primarily from the hiring and retention of additional personnel in such functions as trading and operations to continue to provide an increasingly higher level of service to our sophisticated representative force as a differentiator in the face of increasing competition  compliance to meet the growing needs within the industry for internal control  quality supervision and continuing education to our independent representatives  as well as to reduce legal and settlement expenses  representative recruitment to enhance our ability to recruit higher quality representatives  legal department to help reduce the need for traditionally more expensive outside counsel  and to provide additional services to our representatives and other general administrative areas 
regulatory  legal and professional regulatory  legal and professional expenses increased by million or 
the largest component of this increase was a million increase in legal fees and settlement costs associated with the massachusetts proceedings referred to in footnote to our consolidated financial statements and described in detail in part i  item legal proceedings 
we have taken and will continue to take measures calculated to limit our ongoing exposure to legal proceedings arising from our operations 
in this regard  there was a million decrease compared to the prior period in legal fees and settlement costs associated with litigation other than the massachusetts proceedings 
management believes  although there can be no assurances  that the massachusetts proceedings will prove to be atypical  in terms of financial impact  of legal proceedings that will be generated in the future in connection with our on going operations 
the company s legal expenses  other than those associated with the massachusetts proceedings  page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  decreased for the comparative period 
management believes this result is directly attributable to the company s risk based management approach that seeks to minimize risk by improving the quality of its associated registered representatives while committing resources to educate and train our sales force  efficiently and accurately process their business  and appropriately supervise their business activities 
the company s legal accrual increased by million to million as of march  from million as of march  as a result of the settlement in the massachusetts proceeding 
the company also had various arbitration claims filed against it that warranted an additional accrual increase 
as we operate in an increasingly litigious industry embedded with regulation  we will continue to invest significant resources to reduce the likelihood of future litigation exposure by promoting accuracy  ensuring sound operational techniques and applying appropriate compliance measures 
advertising advertising  including related marketing expenses  decreased by million or  primarily reflecting decreased spending on officer travel 
communications communications expenses decreased by million or  primarily due to a decrease in printing and website costs offset by an increase in telephone expenses 
the costs savings in printing expenses were achieved by communicating to our prospective representatives by emailing our product literature instead of direct mailing 
the company s website is currently used to target new revenue streams by providing access to information through the website and other internet publications 
communication efforts and related expenses  which also include investor public relations  conference  and telephone  have historically been positively correlated with the overall growth of our business 
our website and newsletter  the capitalist  have become effective media to communicate to qualified representatives for recruitment purposes 
occupancy occupancy expenses increased by million or primarily as a result of opening investment centers in braintree  ma  manhattan  ny and bedford  nh and a new business center in miami  fl 
furthermore  we leased additional space for senior management and our marketing department at a separate lynnfield  ma location 
the company also experienced an increase in depreciation due to acquiring additional fixed assets in the form of new computers for the additional staff  leasehold improvements and additional furniture and fixtures for the home office in lynnfield  ma to accommodate the increased number of employees 
other administrative other administrative expenses  which include various insurance  postage  office and computer related expenses  increased slightly by million or 
management continues to mount a concerted effort to reduce general office and postage expenses through several cost saving methods 
interest expense interest expense decreased by reflecting less margin balances in our firm accounts when comparing the current period to the prior period 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  operating and net losses the fact that the company registered operating and net losses during the current period  compared to the operating and net profit during the prior period  can be attributed primarily to expenses related to the massachusetts proceedings and resulting settlement that totaled approximately million during the current period 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
despite a  and increase in gross profit over the prior year for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively  the company has experienced a negative trend in earnings during this same overall period 
the trend is attributable to increases in total operating expenses of  and for the comparable periods 
these operating expense increases have been driven primarily by significant increases in compensation and benefits and in professional fees and legal settlement costs 
in order to remain competitive  the company has increased the number of home office staff by over the two year period ended march  central to this staff enhancement  was the hiring of additional compliance staff  which typically are among the higher paid of our employees 
in addition  salary increases have been necessary to attract and retain higher quality employees so that service levels to our field force are constantly improved 
improvements in our service levels are believed to enhance our current representatives productivity and our ability to attract quality new representatives which  in turn  is believed to be a driving force behind the increase in gross profit experienced over the past three years 
the growth in the number of employees has corresponded with a significant cost increase during the same period in our company funded employee health care program in addition to various office and infrastructure expenses in order to house and support the additional employees necessary to remain competitive during the period 
additionally  the company has committed considerable resources to retaining its key managers and employees in the form of its shareholder approved equity incentive plans 
stock grants authorized under the plan were made to certain key employees during fiscal year ended march  at considerable expense to the company 
professional legal and audit fees and legal settlement costs have also increased significantly over the last three fiscal years and have contributed above all other operating expenses to the negative earnings trend noted above 
in addition to an adverse civil court verdict experienced by the company resulting from commercial litigation unrelated to its core business  the company incurred material legal costs in the fiscal years ended march  and as a result of its prolonged and vigorous defense of a november administrative complaint filed against it by the securities division of the secretary of the commonwealth of massachusetts the massachusetts proceedings 
the company eventually settled this matter at considerable additional expense 
although there can be no assurance  management believes that the expense of litigating and settling the massachusetts proceedings will prove to be atypically high compared to legal proceedings that may be expected to continue to be brought against the company in the future in the litigious and highly regulated environment in which we operate 
for further details regarding the massachusetts proceeding and other legal proceedings  see part i  item legal proceedings and note litigation in this form k 
but for the cost of the massachusetts proceedings and settlement  management believes that the aforementioned negative earnings trend would not have continued during the fiscal years ended march  and further  although there can be no assurances  management believes that there is no present reason to expect the historical negative earnings trend to continue as a result of costs incurred in matters of this type 
fiscal year ended march  compared with fiscal year ended march results reported for the fiscal years ended march  and are comparatively discussed below to the extent that explanations for comparative variances in results for these two fiscal years differ from page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  the explanations given above for variances in the results for the fiscal years ended march  and revenues our revenues rose million  or  to million despite the effects on the economy of increases in interest rates and energy prices 
revenues from commissions increased by million or for the current period compared to the prior period 
advisory services revenue also increased by million or between the same comparative periods 
the significant increase in our revenues reflects general revenue growth in the diversified investment sector of the financial services industry as well as other factors discussed below 
revenue growth continues to be supported by our efforts in recruiting sophisticated and experienced representatives who are qualified and likely to engage in brokerage and investment advisory services 
we had a increase in recruitment of new representatives during the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior year 
revenue growth from these new recruits generated a million or increase in corresponding revenues 
revenues of million or of this million increase  and of all current period revenues from representatives  were derived from trading or brokerage services

revenue designated as trading brokerage includes revenue from mutual funds sold through our trading platform 
although commissions from variable annuities comprise the largest component of commission revenue  the company s revenue base has been shifting toward the brokerage area  which represented of the total increase in commission revenues 
an increasing number of our representatives conduct their page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  business in brokerage accounts which  in turn  improves our margins 
the trend towards brokerage reflects a concerted effort on our part to recruit sophisticated representatives with series licenses who utilize our brokerage platform 
as a result of the shift toward brokerage products  the company experienced higher overall profit margins from sales of the resulting product mix during the current period compared to the prior period 
see gross margins below 
advisory fees advisory services typically provide significantly higher margins than traditional broker dealer products such as variable annuities and mutual funds 
see gross margins 
accordingly  we have been encouraging our representatives to convert more of their business to advisory services 
although we do not control which advisory services our representatives provide for their clients  we continue to make concerted efforts to attract them to our proprietary advisory services programs through seminars  trade shows and direct telemarketing 
fees from our rep directed asset managed program  a map  where asset allocation and other investment advisory services are provided directly by our independent representatives  continue to be the leading source of revenue in this category

revenues from our fund managed f map or separately managed s map accounts  where investment advisory services are provided by epa and ica instead of our independent representatives  increased by million or between the comparative periods 
over recent quarters revenues from the fund managed category have slightly declined due to the termination of accounts where asset values have fallen below a minimum level 
also  management has not been aggressively marketing this program compared to the rep directed asset managed program and s map program 
revenues from asset managed programs where investment services are provided by outside advisors  decreased slightly for the year ended march  epa  and more recently  ica have been continuing to direct their marketing efforts away from these third party management programs and more toward their internal  proprietary asset managed models 
epa and ica have been providing sales  marketing  trading platform and other technical support to our representatives to enable them to deliver improved investment advisory services 
revenues from advisory services provided to mutual funds decreased by 
million when compared to the prior period  reflecting the termination during the current year of the company s management agreement pursuant to which it had been providing advisory services to mutual funds 
our mutual funds constituted only million or of the total advisory services revenue category for the year ended march   and million or for the fiscal year ended march  our current success to our advisory services program recently has been a result of an enhanced online platform that we offer to our representatives  enabling them to perform their services of asset allocation in a more cost effective way 
in addition  these savings have been passed on to the client  resulting in lower fees charged for an improved service 
other fee income other fee income decreased by million or  resulting mostly from a million decrease in administrative fees for providing regulatory services to our representatives in connection with annual renewals of their nasd licenses and errors and omissions e o policy enrollment 
most of this variance stems from the timing in the collection of an e o adjustment during the first quarter for year page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  ended march  there was no e o adjustment for year ended march  offsetting the above mentioned decrease was a million increase in financial planning fees from sophisticated representatives providing portfolio strategy for their clients asset managed accounts 
in addition  we experienced a million dollar increase in other administrative fees to cover the increase in compliance costs for the maintenance of books and records 
finally  there was a million decrease in administration fees on asset managed accounts as a result of the termination of several of these accounts when asset balances fell below minimum levels 
marketing revenue net marketing revenues decreased by million or  reflecting a million increase in the cost to host our annual national convention held in boston in october and our diamond achiever conference in march offsetting this decrease was a million dollar increase in marketing support revenues from several fund companies based on increases in sales volume of their products 
we also saw a million increase in marketing support revenues from our regional meetings and sales of ancillary items such as apparel  bags  hats with our logo and blast email services 
other income other income  consisting primarily of interest and dividends and gains or losses on investments  increased by million for the comparative current period to the prior period 
the majority of the increase came primarily from interest earned on account balances due to the increase in daily average balance in our trading accounts 
gross margins gross margin rose by million or to million for the current period primarily due to a million or increase in gross margin derived from trading over the prior period 
trading the increase in gross margin from trading reflects an increase in brokerage commissions and a reduction in clearing charges due to increased sales volume  increased commission retention rates  and more fee income within corporate accounts 
contributing to this improvement in gross margins from trading was a million increase in the margin from our trails and from money market on account balances and a million contribution from net trading commissions 
the primary increase in gross margins from trading commission is derived from a million increase in net trade commissions from lower producing payout representatives 
the combined effect of these factors was an increase in our average payout retention in brokerage services from in the prior period to in the current period which  in turn  contributed to an increase in our gross trading margin from to 
please refer to gross margin table above 
other factors contributing to the increase in gross margin from trading was that there was a million trading error in april of that was realized in fiscal as well as investments in personnel and technology to expand and upgrade the capabilities of our trading and operations department that enabled us to more efficiently service the increase in trading volume 
through our efforts we are continuing to recruit more capable and experienced representatives who can offer a broader range of brokerage products which have a greater profit margin compared to the normal mutual fund and variable annuity products see commissions  above 
advisory services page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  advisory services profit margin increased by million or for the current period to the prior period 
the majority of the profit margin in advisory services stems from our rep directed asset managed programs that make it possible for representatives managing client accounts to trade directly online using our automated trading platform 
resulting increases in the representative s trading volume effectively increase the company s commission revenues and gross margin 
additionally  by processing more transactions at a stable fixed cost  our enhanced trading technology fosters economies of scale that control operating expenses required to process the increased trade volume 
although we experienced an increase in profit margin from advisory services during the comparative period  our retention rate decreased from to 
there were a couple of factors contributing to this retention percentage decrease 
advisory fee rates derived from rep directed business declined slightly  reflecting decreases in the commission retention rate for client accounts whose balances reached levels that trigger automatic retention rate reductions 
also  as a result of terminating the management agreement associated with the mutual funds we no longer receive any advisory fees from that revenue component which directly contributed to our margin although our retention rate from advisory services decreased compared to the prior period  this category on a percentage retention basis still retains a higher profit margin than most of the other products or services we and our representatives provide 
see gross margin table  above 
mutual funds  variable annuities  etc 
profit margins from mutual fund sales  variable annuity sales  direct participation programs and other check and application distribution programs contributed million or of the total gross margin compared to million or during the prior period 
as presented in the previous gross margin table  margin from our check and application distribution programs comprised the greatest contribution to our overall profit margin  however  trading achieved the largest percentage increase for the comparative period of march  versus march  commission expenses commission payouts to our independent representatives  as a percentage of commissioned revenues  remained virtually steady at for this fiscal year ended march  versus for the fiscal year ended march  management is continuing efforts to improve commission retention rates by refining our business model to emphasize the recruitment and retention of sophisticated representatives 
these individuals can offer a variety of brokerage and advisory products and services that give us better commission retention rates than those obtained from mutual funds and variable annuities 
we experienced higher margins from trading as a result of ticket charges and fees pertaining to increases in account balances that flow entirely to the profit margin 
from advisory services we receive fees on the asset balance in the account that go directly to the firm 
refer to the revenue recognition policy 
operating expenses operating expenses  which experienced a million or increase for the year ended march   are discussed in detail below compensation and benefits the largest component of operating expenses is compensation and benefits which increased by million or during the current period 
this is substantially below the absolute and percentage growth rates achieved in revenues and gross margins 
this change includes primarily an increase in general salaries of million offset by a decrease in officer s salary of 
million primarily as a result of the resignation of epa s president during our fiscal quarter ended june  there was also a million decrease in stock option compensation due to a reduction in the value of stock options distributed based on the black scholes method of option valuation for the comparative years ended page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  march  versus march  the company sustained a million increase in compensation expenses from k contributions  health insurance and payroll taxes in the current period versus the prior period 
this increase along with the increase in general salaries primarily was the result of the hiring of additional personnel 
the company went from having full time employees at march  to full time employees at march  to support continued growth of the company 
there was a million increase in additional personnel expense that was needed to support the increase in business from the trading and operations sector 
resources were committed to ensure that the company continues to provide quality customer service to our sophisticated representative force 
also  million of addition expense was incurred in connection with the hiring of additional personnel in the area of compliance 
resources were devoted in this area to meet the growing needs within the industry of providing an adequate framework of internal control  quality supervision and continuing education to our independent representative force 
regulatory  legal and professional regulatory  legal and professional expenses increased by million or 
the largest component of this increase was a million or increase in non in house legal fees  million of which was incurred in connection with the massachusetts proceedings described in detail in part i  item legal proceedings 
an additional million of this increase arose from other actions that management believes  with advice of counsel  are of the exposures likely to be presented by our ongoing operations 
there were million in legal settlements from dealings uncommon to our business that contributed to the million increase in lawsuit settlement expenses 
we also experienced a million dollar increase in lawsuit settlements arising from transactions conducted in the normal course of business 
we increased our accruals for legal expenses from million for the prior period to million for the current period 
please refer to footnote to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
in addition  since we operate in an industry embedded with regulation  we will continue to invest significant resources to reduce the likelihood of future litigation by promoting accuracy  ensuring sound operational techniques and providing appropriate compliance measures 
finally  we experienced a million increase in accounting expenses  primarily audit related  while regulatory and professional expenses remained essentially flat for the comparative periods 
advertisement and marketing advertising expenses increased overall by million or due to a change in the overall marketing approach in our recruitment process 
management determined that it was more effective to communicate to a potential representative force with general marketing materials 
as a result of this marketing strategy  general marketing expenses increased by million offset by a million decline in advertising expenses magazines  brochures 
also there was million dollar increase in meals and entertainment as a result of the officers of the company continuing to meet potential representatives 
communications communications expenses increased by million or  primarily due to increases in printing and website expenses approximating million and million  respectively 
these costs were incurred to target new revenue streams by providing access to information through the internet and other publications 
communication efforts and related expenses  which also include investor public relations  conference  and telephone  have historically been positively correlated with the overall growth of our page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  business 
our website and newsletter the capitalist have become effective medium to communicate to potential qualified representatives for recruitment purposes 
occupancy occupancy expenses increased by million or primarily as a result from million in added costs for rent and condominium fees and a million increase in depreciation 
in the current period we added two new investment centers in braintree  massachusetts and new york  new york 
we acquired additional fixed assets in new computers for the additional staff  leasehold improvements and additional furniture and fixtures to the home office in lynnfield  massachusetts to accommodate the increase in number of employees 
other administrative other administrative expenses  which include various insurance  postage  office and computer related expenses  decreased by million or 
the company experienced a million increase in office expenses related primarily to the opening of a new recruitment office in miami  florida and the cost of a full year of operations of our los angeles  california recruitment office 
increases in other administrative expenses also included 
million of additional office supply expense  a million increase in bank charges resulting from a heavy volume credit card transactions to process representative license renewals  a million increase in other taxes due to the prior year s adjustment regarding sales and use tax  and a million increase in donations 
offsetting those increases  computer maintenance services declined by million reflecting a greater reliance on in house staff to service our computer systems and maintain our website 
postage decreased by million as a result of paying commissions through electronic funds transmission eft and providing commission reports to our representatives over our website versus mailing out their check and commission statement 
also  the company utilized the united states post office for overnight deliveries  which is less expensive than other parcel couriers 
other declines in office related expenses were from mutual fund expenses which experienced a million decline due to the termination of the management agreement for the mutual funds  and a million decline in bad debt expenses from the write off of bad debt related to loans extended to our representatives 
no loans were written off during the fiscal year ended march  interest expense interest expense increased by in comparing the prior period to the current period 
this was primarily due from interest on margin balances on firm accounts and from interest on short term obligations 
operating income operating income decreased by million or due to an increase in operating expenses of 
the most significant contributors to the increase in operating expenses were million in legal fees in the massachusetts proceedings and an additional million in legal fees and settlements incurred in other legal proceedings that the company believes in the aggregate will prove to be atypically heavy when compared with legal related expenses incurred in the course of future operations 
we will continue to make substantial investments in our selling and administrative services capabilities  including additions to management  personnel and service infrastructure  as part of a concerted strategy to increase revenues and profitability 
management firmly believes that a sustained focus on enhancing our state of the art business platform will facilitate accelerated recruitment of independent representatives that are focused on growing revenues  particularly in high margin lines such as advisory and trading services 
as part of this effort  the company continues to invest in an automated trading system that enables sophisticated representatives to enhance client base and activity 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  net income net income decreased by approximately million or  or per basic and per diluted share  due to a decrease in operating income and a related increase in the provision for income taxes due to deferred tax items 
the decrease in operating income is a result of incurring more operating expenses  primarily legal expenses  proportionate to the increase in revenues and profit margins compared to the fiscal year ended march  in partial offset  we experienced a million gain on the sale of an asset during the current period 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
there was no such gain in the prior period  however  there was a million dollar loss on early disposal of computer equipment 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes that achieving its return on equity goals requires the efficient use of capital 
we have financed our operations primarily with internally generated cash flow 
cash inflows historically have come primarily from the company s core broker dealer and investment advisory services which  in recent years  have proven profitable except during the most recent fiscal year when financial results were reduced by million in costs associated with the massachusetts proceedings see part i  item legal proceedings 
this historic profitability typically has followed an annual cycle of relatively average profitability during the first and third fiscal quarters  relatively low profitability during the second fiscal quarter when several representatives and their clients are on summer vacation  and relatively high profitability during the fourth fiscal quarter when several representatives and their clients start a new business and investment year 
in addition to the annual profitability cycle  negative fluctuations and general uncertainty in financial markets can have a negative impact on cash flow 
the company works to minimize this impact by aggressively recruiting sophisticated representatives who can offer diversified products that continue to meet the needs of their clients despite changing market conditions 
the company takes a proactive approach to minimizing or even preventing the occurrence of other events that may lead to unexpected cash outflows  including lawsuits  trade errors and fines from regulatory agencies such as the nasd or the sec 
a key to this approach is ensuring that adequate controls over our operations and those of our representatives are implemented and periodically updated 
as part of this effort  substantial resources have been committed to enhancing the capabilities of our compliance team  whose tasks include assuring that our representatives give proper weight to the circumstances and interests of their clients when recommending investment options 
the company also allocates resources to stay current with the many rules and regulations applicable to our business by assisting in the education and training of our sales representatives and staff 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million as compared to million as of march  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  as compared to to as of march   principally due to cash disbursements of million over the course of the current period resulting from the massachusetts proceedings and settlement 
operations used million in cash for the year ended march  as compared to million of cash used for the year ended march in comparing cash flow from operating activities for fiscal year ended march  to fiscal year ended march   we can see that cash flow decreased by million as a result of a net loss of million for the current period versus net income of million in the prior period 
the million used in the massachusetts proceedings and settlement more than accounted for the swing in cash flow from operating activities 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  also during the current period we incurred stock based compensation in the form of restricted stock that is a million year ended non cash add back adjustment in comparing the current to the prior period 
we also had additional cash flow increases of million from incurred liabilities  including million of expense accruals related to the massachusetts proceedings and settlement 
finally  deferred taxes reduced cash flow by million 
cash outflows from investing activities for the current period totaled million of which million resulted from purchasing equipment as well as technology and leasehold improvements 
in addition  we invested million in us treasury bills and notes 
as part of our financing activities we paid a million cash dividend on june  to shareholders of record as of june  in addition  we incurred a short term note obligation to finance insurance premiums which increased cash flow by million 
as of march   cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million as of march  working capital as of march  was million as compared to million as of march  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to as of march  as compared to to as of march  operations used million in cash for the year ended march  as compared to providing million cash for the year ended march  cash flow from operations  in comparing the current period to the prior period  decreased by million as a result of several factors 
we experienced a million decrease in net income 
we had a cash flow decrease of million from our trade receivables and a million decrease in accounts receivable asset held for sale 
we also had a decrease in loan grants to registered representatives to help grow their businesses 
also comparing cash flow from operations for the year ended march  to the year ended march   we experienced a million cash flow increase from income taxes  a million decrease from current payables in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a million increase resulting from commission payables 
cash outflows from investing activities for the year ended march  comprised million of which million was for purchasing equipment as well as technology and leasehold improvements 
also  we had a million cash outflow for an investment through a private placement 
finally  as part of our financing activities we paid a million cash dividend on may  to shareholders of record as of may   offset by million received in financing debt for our insurance premiums 
cash disbursements for legal related matters during the year ended march  totaled million including million for legal fees relating to the massachusetts proceedings and million for the initial payment pertaining to the settlement of the massachusetts proceedings 
subsequent to the march  there will be at least an additional million to be paid to the eligible purchasers of equity indexed annuities and or the state of massachusetts under the terms of the consent agreement 
management at this time does not foresee such future cash out flows exceeding million that will impact our future cash position 
payments to eligible purchasers since december of have totaled 
million to the date of this form k 
see part i  item legal proceedings 
management believes  although there can be no assurances  that the current period net cash outflow which reflects unusually burdensome expenditures to defend and settle the massachusetts proceedings will not be indicative of future cash outflow trends 
the scale of the financial damage resulting from the massachusetts proceedings has been atypical of legal proceedings that the company has experienced to date and  in management s estimation  will prove to be atypical of legal proceedings that may be expected to occur in the future 
whether or not management s expectations will come to fruition may in no small measure depend on the degree to which we succeed  through a continually evolving and robust compliance regime  in assuring that the firm and its independent representatives operate in conformity page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  with the many laws  rules and regulations pertaining to our broker dealer and investment advisory operations 
the unprecedented disbursements during the fiscal year ended march  associated with the massachusetts proceedings have had a significant negative impact on our brokerage firm s net capital ratio 
the sec uniform net capital rule rule c requires that icc  our broker dealer subsidiary  maintain net capital of  and a ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital a net capital ratio not to exceed to under the rule  indebtedness generally includes all money owed by a company  and net capital includes cash and assets that are easily converted into cash 
sec rules also prohibit equity capital which  under the net capital rule  includes subordinated loans from being withdrawn  cash dividends from being paid and other specified actions of similar effect from being taken  if  among other specified contingencies  the company s net capital ratio would exceed to or if we would have less than of our minimum required net capital 
as of march   icc had net capital of million ie  an excess of million and a to net capital ratio as compared to net capital of approximately million ie  an excess of million and a to to net capital ratio as of march  in december  ich infused million in capital to icc to offset the cash drain resulting from the massachusetts proceedings and settlement 
the company s legal accrual increased considerably to million as of march  from million as of march  primarily as a result of the settlement of the massachusetts proceedings 
the company also had other various arbitrations filed against it that warranted a portion of the accrual increase 
during the current period the increase in our legal accrual impacted icc s net capital ratio and excess net capital 
the company does not consider this to be a trend and does not currently anticipate that similar accrual increases will be a recurring necessity 
see footnote to our consolidated financial statements 
the company currently has ample cash to cover additional accruals and disbursements resulting from these proceedings 
despite these legal proceedings  that increased our legal accrual  the company remains focused on committing the resources necessary for continued growth 
during the fiscal year ended march  in its former role as investment adviser to the eastern point advisors funds trust family of mutual funds  company disbursements to pay fund expenses that exceeded their respective caps averaged million per quarter 
as previously noted  the company agreed to terminate its management contract with the trust and  accordingly  the company received a net cash flow infusion of million for the year ended march  versus a million cash flow outlay for the year ended march  see part i  item retail mutual funds for the year ended march   cash inflows from operating activities primarily came from net income  which contributed million as well as the collection of million of accounts receivable and million from current liabilities in accrued expenses and accounts payable 
cash flows decreased by million primarily from million in payments of income taxes 
cash flows also decreased by million for payment of commissions and million for loans to representatives to help them grow their business 
finally we had a cash outflow of million to the nasd to pay a note in full 
icc made a business decision in the fiscal year ended march  to conclude an nasd investigation into supervisory procedures relating to the period of january  through july  while we considered disputing the allegations in a formal proceeding  we estimated the cost of doing so to be prohibitive 
furthermore  we sought to avoid disruption of our operations 
accordingly  while neither admitting nor denying the allegations  we consented to a number of findings in order to resolve the matter in its initial stages 
repayment of the resulting settlement note to nasd did not have a material effect on cash flow at any time during the current period as the note was fully paid on august  the company has implemented and maintains an adequate system of supervisory and regulatory procedures and does not foresee any material deficiencies in the future in this regard 
page investors capital holdings ltd k fiscal year ended march  from investing activities we had cash outflows of million for equipment and technology
