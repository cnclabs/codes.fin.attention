table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of novel therapeutics that harness the immune system to fight cancer 
our portfolio includes active immunotherapy  monoclonal antibody and small molecule product candidates to treat a wide range of cancers 
the product candidates most advanced in development are active immunotherapies designed to stimulate a patient s immune system for the treatment of cancer 
our most advanced product candidate is provenge sipuleucel t  an active cellular immunotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  clinical trial expenses  contract manufacturing expenses and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop the infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge and other product candidates we may develop 
we own worldwide commercialization rights for provenge 
we may or may not generate revenue from the sale of our potential commercial therapeutic products during the next year depending upon the approval of provenge by the us food drug administration fda 
without revenue generated from commercial sales  we anticipate that we will continue to fund our ongoing research  development and general operations from our available cash resources  future offerings of equity  debt or other securities and with license fees and milestone payments received from our collaborators 
we expect our costs to increase in the future as a result of increased clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs and costs associated with operating our new jersey manufacturing facility 
in january  we announced the realignment of our resources to focus on achieving fda approval for provenge as expeditiously as possible and to reduce operating costs 
the majority of our resources were used to complete our biologics license application our bla  during and prepare for the commercialization of provenge 
we anticipate operating expenses to increase in the future as we continue our commercialization efforts for provenge 
in september  we announced plans to submit our bla to the fda to market provenge 
this decision followed a pre bla meeting in which we reviewed safety and efficacy data with the fda from our two completed phase clinical trials for provenge  d and da 
in these discussions the fda agreed that the survival benefit observed in the d study in conjunction with the supportive data obtained from study da and the absence of significant toxicity in both studies was sufficient to serve as the clinical basis of our bla submission for provenge 
provenge was granted fast track designation from the fda for the treatment of asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer patients  which enabled us to submit our bla on a rolling basis 
on august   we submitted the clinical and non clinical sections of our bla and on november   we submitted the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section  completing our submission of our bla to the fda for provenge 
on january   the fda accepted our bla filing and assigned priority review status for provenge 
the goal for reviewing a product with priority review status is six months from the filing date 
the prescription drug user fee act pdufa date for the anticipated completion of review by the fda of the provenge bla is may  provenge will be reviewed by the fda s cellular  tissue and gene therapies advisory committee on march  in august  we divided our d trial into da discussed above and db  our ongoing supportive phase study  now known as the impact immunotherapy for prostate adenocarcinoma treatment study 
the impact study was initiated in june under a special protocol assessment spa for the treatment of men with asymptomatic  metastatic  androgen independent prostate cancer whose tumors had been classified as gleason score or less 
based upon results of the two completed phase studies  d and da  we met with the fda and amended the db spa protocol to open the trial to men regardless of gleason score and to elevate survival to the primary endpoint 
approximately men will be enrolled and men with asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic disease are eligible for the study 
we expect to complete enrollment in the impact study during safety data from our impact study has been included in our bla 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we make judgmental decisions and estimates with underlying assumptions when applying accounting principles to prepare our consolidated financial statements 
certain critical accounting policies requiring significant judgments  estimates  and assumptions are detailed below 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes to the estimate or different estimates  that could have reasonably been used  would have materially changed our consolidated financial statements 
the development and selection of these critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  should our actual experience differ from these assumptions and other considerations used in estimating these amounts  the impact of these differences could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of the revenue we receive is collaborative research revenue and license revenue 
we recognize collaborative research revenues from up front payments and milestone payments 
we also recognize license revenue from intellectual property and technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are generally contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units 
license fees license fees from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which we have continuing obligations  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  an estimate is made of the time required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
the basis of the revenue recognition is reviewed and adjusted based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectibility is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
milestones payments for milestones that are based on the achievement of substantive and at risk performance criteria are recognized in full at such time as the specified milestone has been achieved according to the terms of the agreement 
when payments are not for substantive and at risk milestones  revenue will be recognized immediately for the proportionate amount of the payment that correlates to services that have already been rendered  and the balance will be recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated remaining term of the research and development service period 
the basis of the research and development service period is reviewed and adjusted based on the progress of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
royalty income royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products  and revenues are calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured

accounting for research and development costs sfas  our research and development costs are expensed as incurred or at the date payment of non refundable upfront fees and milestones become due  whichever occurs first 
the value of acquired in process research and development is charged to expense on the date of acquisition 
research and development expenses include  but are not limited to  payroll and personnel expenses  lab expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  facilities and related overhead costs 
accounting for stock based compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board the fasb  issued sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which revised sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and superseded apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
sfas r requires the grant date fair value of all share based payment awards that are expected to vest  including employee share options  to be recognized as employee compensation expense over the requisite service period 
we adopted sfas r on january  and applied the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  we did not restate any prior periods and are recognizing compensation expense for all share based payment awards that were outstanding  but not yet vested  as of january   based upon the same estimated grant date fair values and service periods used to prepare our sfas pro forma disclosures 
for additional information about stock based compensation and the pro forma effect of recording our share based compensation plans under the fair value method of sfas r  refer to note of the consolidated financial statements 
we grant restricted stock awards that generally vest over a four year period  however in we granted restricted stock awards with performance conditions to all employees 
the performance conditions state that vesting for percent of the shares would accelerate upon acceptance of our bla by the fda and the balance upon the approval of provenge for commercialization by the fda 
in accordance with sfas r  management is required to estimate the probability of achieving each acceleration provision 
compensation expense is recorded based upon our assessment of accomplishing each provision 
we recorded stock based employee compensation expense in the consolidated statement of operations in  and of million   and million  respectively 
we recognize compensation expense for our stock based payment awards on the accelerated method over the requisite service period of the entire award  unless the awards are subject to other conditions  in which case we recognize compensation expense over the requisite service period of each separate vesting tranche 
we determine the grant date fair value of our stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued staff position no 
sfas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fsp r 
we elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fsp r for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation under sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool the apic pool related to the tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
we have determined adoption will have no impact on our apic pool 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on nonrecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
the intent of sab is to reduce diversity in practice on the method companies use to quantify financial statements misstatements  including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance sheet approach 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the transition adjustment  which is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of those financial instruments at the date this statement is initially applied  should be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of no 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas expands opportunities to use fair value measurements in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for us on january   although we can choose to adopt it on january  if we also adopt sfas at that time 
we are currently evaluating whether we will elect early adoption of sfas or if we will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
results of operations for the years ended december   and revenue revenue was  in   in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to revenue related to an intellectual property option purchase agreement entered into in revenue recognized for the year ended december  also includes recognition of deferred revenue related to a license agreement with genentech  inc the decrease in compared to was due to revenue recognized in in connection with our license agreement with nuvelo  inc for our novel anticoagulant  recombinant nematode anticoagulant protein c rnapc and all other rnapc proteins 
in august  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to collaborate in the preclinical research  clinical development  and commercialization of products derived from our trp p gene platform 
we and genentech are currently engaged in discovering  evaluating and developing small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapeutics that modify trp p function 
we have discovered selective trp p small molecule agonists that induce cell death and inhibit the growth of trp p positive tumors in animals 
genentech s option to participate in the small molecule program has expired 
consequently  we own worldwide rights to the small molecule program 
genentech continues to be primarily responsible for the monoclonal antibody products program and has certain rights with respect to other products in our agreement with them 
we received a non refundable up front fee of million upon signing the agreement 
this payment has been deferred and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated research term of ten years  which represents our continuing obligations under this agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  genentech also made a million equity investment in our common stock in august during the years ended december   and we recognized revenue of   and  respectively  related to this agreement 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million in  million in and million in the increase compared with was primarily due to increased clinical development costs of million due to increased patient enrollment and other costs associated with the db clinical trial  non cash based stock compensation of million due to the adoption of sfas r on january  and severance costs 
table of contents of million related to our january restructuring 
the increase compared with was primarily due to increased contract manufacturing costs to support the db clinical trial and to prepare for commercial level production runs of the antigen used in provenge  personnel related costs  clinical expense due to increased patient enrollment and other costs associated with the db clinical trial  consulting fees related to the commercialization of provenge and contract research fees related to our trp p program 
financial data from our research and development related activities is compiled and managed by us for clinical programs and discovery research 
our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions clinical programs cancer cardiovascular from our acquisition of corvas indirect costs total clinical programs discovery research total research and development expense direct research and development costs associated with our clinical programs include clinical trial site costs  clinical manufacturing costs  costs incurred for consultants and other outside services  such as data management and statistical analysis support  and materials and supplies used in support of the clinical programs 
indirect costs of our clinical program include wages  payroll taxes and other employee related expenses including rent  restructuring  stock based compensation  utilities and other facilities related maintenance 
the costs in each category may change in the future and new categories may be added 
costs attributable to our discovery research programs represent our efforts to develop and expand our product pipeline 
due to the number of projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects  our discovery research program costs are not assigned to specific projects 
while we believe our clinical programs are promising  we do not know whether any commercially viable products will result from our research and development efforts 
due to the unpredictable nature of scientific research and product development  we cannot reasonably estimate the timeframe over which our projects are likely to be completed  whether they will be completed  if they are completed  whether they will provide therapeutic benefit or be approved for commercialization by the necessary regulatory agencies  or whether  if approved  they will be scalable to meet commercial demand 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses in and were primarily comprised of salaries and wages  consulting fees  marketing fees and administrative costs to support our operations 
the increase in compared with was primarily attributable to million of non cash stock compensation expense due to the adoption of sfas r on january  general and administrative expenses in included costs associated with the closure of our san diego facility of approximately million  non cash board compensation expenses of  and non cash compensation of  interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to and compared to was primarily due to higher average interest rates  offset by a decrease in interest income earned on a declining cash and investment balance 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in the decrease in was primarily due to capitalizing million in interest costs related to the construction of the hanover  new jersey manufacturing facilities 
the increase in was primarily due to an increase in the average capital lease balance in compared to foreign tax benefit expense during the year ended december   we reversed our deferred foreign income tax liability and recognized a tax benefit of million based on a new tax treaty entered into between the united states and japan on march  the new treaty eliminated withholding taxes on all royalties  certain interest income and other inter company dividends 
income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards before utilization 
stock based compensation expense stock based employee compensation expense in was a result of adoption of sfas r on january  stock based employee compensation expense in and consisted of the amortization of deferred stock based employee compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices less than the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date  modifications to stock options  grant of restricted stock awards and the issuance of stock options to non employees in exchange for services and stock option modifications 
in june  we accelerated the vesting of million shares of unvested and out of the money stock options outstanding that had a per share exercise price of or higher in order to reduce the negative impact on our results from operations when sfas r became effective 
as a result of the accelerated vesting  pro forma stock based employee compensation expense in as presented in note to the consolidated financial statements reflects an additional charge of million 
we granted stock purchase rights to employees hired after august   including those involved in the corvas acquisition  which were not qualified under the employee stock purchase plan and were considered compensatory 
we recognized stock based compensation charges of approximately million and  of accrued payroll tax when the rights were exercised during the year ended december  of the million non cash stock based compensation  million was recorded as research and development expense and  as general and administrative expense 
we recorded an additional  charge in the year ended december   representing payroll and federal income tax payments made on behalf of the affected employees 
total stock based employee compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in  and was million   and million  respectively 
total stock based employee compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations in  and increased our net loss per share by  and  respectively 
as we use a full valuation allowance with respect to deferred taxes  the adoption of sfas r had no impact on deferred taxes 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash uses and proceeds as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity securities  cash received from collaboration agreements  interest income earned and debt instruments 
net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were attributable to research and development expenses  clinical trial costs  contract manufacturing costs  general and administrative expenses and marketing expenses in support of our operations 
in  and  these expenditures were partially offset by cash received from our corporate collaborators including license fees from kirin of million in each of  and and from nuvelo of  in we expect cash used in operations to increase in the future as a result of increased clinical trial activity  costs associated with operating and expanding our new jersey manufacturing facility and the ongoing development of a commercial infrastructure to support the commercialization of provenge 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and maturities of short term and long term investments  consist primarily of purchases of property and equipment 
at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand  including our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months  provided  however  that if provenge is approved for commercialization  it is anticipated that additional money will be necessary for  among other things costs for the development of marketing  manufacturing  information technology and other infrastructure and activities related to the commercialization of provenge  working capital needs  supporting additional clinical trials of provenge and for our other products under development  operating and expanding our new jersey manufacturing facility  and continuing our internal research and development programs 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through sales of common stock  debt securities or borrowings  or otherwise  should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials and this could adversely impact our commercialization efforts of provenge 
construction and facility expenses on august   we entered into an agreement to lease  square feet of commercial manufacturing space in hanover  new jersey 
the lease term is seven years and we have the option to extend the lease for two ten year periods and one five year period  with the same terms and conditions except for rent  which adjusts to market rate 
we intend to outfit this facility in phases to meet the anticipated clinical and commercial manufacturing needs for provenge and our other immunotherapy product candidates in development 
the initial phase of the build out of the facility was completed in july in february  we started to manufacture provenge for clinical use in this facility 
property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes million of construction in progress related to the build out and construction of the facility 
the lease required us to provide the landlord with a letter of credit in the amount of million as a security deposit  which was recorded as long term restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  in addition to the letter of credit  the restricted cash balance included a collateral amount of  which was required by wells fargo  the bank that issued the letter of credit on our behalf 

table of contents in december  we entered into the first two of a series of anticipated promissory notes the notes  with general electric capital corporation ge capital  for the purchase of equipment and associated build out costs for our hanover  new jersey manufacturing facility 
the notes  which evidence one loan with an original principal amount of million bearing interest at percent per year and the remaining loans with original principal amounts totaling million with an average interest rate of percent  were drawn in full and are to be repaid in consecutive monthly installments of principal and interest 
the notes are secured by a master security agreement the security agreement  and two security deposit pledge agreements the pledge agreements 
pursuant to the pledge agreements  we deposited an aggregate of million as a security deposit for the repayment of the million note  which finances the soft costs such as leasehold improvements and designs  and will be released pro rata upon the repayment of the loan or upon receipt of fda approval of provenge 
there is a material adverse change clause in the security agreement which may accelerate the maturity of the notes upon the occurrence of certain events 
we do not believe a material adverse change in our financial condition has occurred 
the security deposit is recorded on our consolidated balance sheet in restricted cash and long term restricted cash 
as of december   we had financed million of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment under several leases with ge life sciences and technology financings 
in  we entered into a capital lease with oracle corporation to finance our enterprise resource planning system 
the amount of remaining lease payments due under these leases as of december  was approximately million 
production and supply expenses on october   we entered into a second amendment to our bioprocessing services agreement originally dated march  with diosynth rtp  inc pursuant to this agreement  diosynth undertook to produce the antigen used in provenge at commercial manufacturing levels to support our bla filing for provenge 
diosynth s work under this agreement has been completed 
the total contract price to us was million  of which  remained unpaid as of december  we satisfied our initial million payment obligation under this agreement by issuing  shares of our common stock  priced at per share  the average closing price of our stock over the trading days preceding the amendment 
for accounting purposes  these shares were valued based on the fair market value of at issuance date  resulting in a charge of million 
on december   we entered into a supply agreement with diosynth covering the commercial production of the antigen used in connection with provenge 
our first binding order to diosynth for commercial scale quantities of the antigen was placed on the same day and commenced production in january our current obligation as of december  is to pay diosynth during equity financings we have received net proceeds of million from the sale of equity securities since january  our existing shelf registration statement filed in august with the sec to sell up to million of our common stock from time to time was declared effective in october in december  we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million  or million  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had short term investments of million and million  respectively and long term investments of million and million  respectively 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short and long term investments at december   assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
we limit our exposure to adjustable interest rates on our financings by capping the interest rate at a fixed amount
