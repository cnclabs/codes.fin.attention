item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview we are a global provider of information technology it  enterprise support and business process outsourcing services to fortune companies  government entities  multinational companies  product and service providers  and small and medium sized companies 
we had a difficult year in on a number of fronts 
first  certain new and existing customer accounts proved quite challenging to our overall profitability  particularly during the first half of the year 
these accounts generally improved their performance each quarter 
second  our government unit and our hospitality systems implementation and training business experienced a decline in revenue from the conclusion of certain contracts and wind down of projects 
third  we became engaged in a costly and distracting proxy contest with one of our largest shareholders that ended amicably in may  but substantially impaired our earnings during the first half of the year 
fourth  we recorded an asset impairment charge to cost of revenue during the first quarter 
and finally  we concluded the transition of leadership  which included the appointment of a new president and chief executive officer  restructuring our executive team and electing a board of directors largely comprised of new members 
the combination of these factors caused our net income to decline from million  or per share  in to million  or per share  in while the financial impact of these items was unfortunate  we believe that our base business is stable  we have tangible opportunities to grow organically  and our leadership team is focused on objectives that will improve our business in the long term 
several positive trends appeared during the second half of the year  including revenue momentum driven in part by the addition of several new customers for our enterprise support service model over the last four months of the year 
we are also expanding our services for some existing clients and are deepening our relationships with them 
we are focused on expanding the markets for our enterprise support service model for our customers 
during and the first quarter of  we began to provide enterprise support services to new large enterprise customers  including phillip morris international and boehringer ingelheim uk once we begin providing service to a customer  we are regularly able to further expand the scope of our services to that customer because an increased volume of business allows us to obtain a higher utilization of resources and allows us to obtain a lower cost that can be passed onto the customer 
we believe that we will continue to see growth in our enterprise support for large businesses 
we are also strategically expanding the scope of services provided within our enterprise support service model 
in order to enhance the value added set of services within our model  we are increasing our expertise in it services management through the implementation of the comprehensive set of best practices set forth in the information technology infrastructure library itil  which has been integrated into the iso standards 
in addition to incident management  our current core service offering  we are expanding our services to include problem management  change management  configuration management  availability management and capacity management  thereby increasing the value of our services 
the growth opportunities available to us will not be free of challenges 
in the early months of a new contract  we can experience downward margin pressure as clients do not want to bear the full cost of transitioning to a managed service model of enterprise support 
with several  new large scale customers ramping to full volume over the first half of  we anticipate reduced margins on these accounts 
another challenge is the need to implement a technology platform that enables the highest quality service across the globe while maximizing the overall value and utilization of our technicians 
we are in the process of upgrading our global phone switch technology and our workforce management software to help accomplish this objective 
as part of our service offering to small and medium sized businesses  we have initiated a business relationship with ca  inc under which we can license ca s suite of tools to provide itil based software and services to our customers 
due to these and other projects  we expect our capital expenditures to increase in  as compared to next  ford motor company ford continues to be a significant customer and is under significant financial pressure as it implements its way forward plan 
we estimate that our total revenue from ford under all programs will decline approximately in from please refer to our discussion of ford in the impact of business with major clients section of md a 
also  we have several contract renewals in  which may be challenging as clients seek improved price points together with an enhanced level of service 
finally  we expect an increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expense in future periods in absolute dollars as we continue to make careful and considerate investments in areas to support our global growth such as our sales and marketing capabilities  additional executive talent  human resources and  as noted above  our technology infrastructure 
however  we are maintaining a proactive focus on spending and cost avoidance and will continue to pursue sg a spending levels that are of revenue or less 
this is a challenge that will likely take the next several quarters or longer to achieve as we make investments to position ourselves for long term growth 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our business consists of two main components our commercial business and our government business 
together  our it outsourcing services segment  it consulting and systems integration segment and other services segment comprise our commercial business 
our government technology services segment comprises our government business 
in addition to managing our business by these service lines  we also manage our business by geographic market the americas defined as north america excluding our government based subsidiaries  emea europe  middle east and africa and government solutions defined as our government based subsidiaries 
together  the americas and emea comprise our commercial business 
during the fourth quarter of  we combined two operating segments technical staffing and learning services into one operating segment called other services since these segments represent less than of our total revenue 
during the fourth quarter of  we also reclassified certain projects between our three main service lines it outsourcing services  government technology services and it consulting and systems integration to allow us to track business unit results more appropriately and to report consistent with how the services are managed 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to be consistent with the current year presentation

globally  it outsourcing services revenue generated from ford declined to million in  from million in revenue from ford declined in each country united states  germany and sweden except the united kingdom  where we began providing spoc services to jaguar and land rover in march revenue from ford in other regions decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of seats supported as ford continues to restructure its operations and reduce its worldwide workforce and from lower prices charged under the global spoc program contract renewal on december  please refer to our discussion of ford in the impact of business with major clients section of md a 
it consulting and systems integration services revenue from it consulting and systems integration decreased to million in  from million in  due to the wind down of certain systems implementation and training projects from techteam cyntergy  which provides deployment  training and implementation services to companies in the hospitality  retail  food service and other industries and drove significant growth in this segment in the decline in revenue was partially offset by our acquisition of akela in october excluding revenue from our acquisition of akela  revenue from it consulting and systems integration decreased to million in  from million in while the decline in revenue from certain project based work was expected  we were not able to replace the work prior to the decline in revenue 
government technology services revenue from government technology services decreased to million in  from million in  primarily due to the conclusion of two contracts that provided million in incremental revenue in over  and the completion of projects at other customers 
most significantly  while our contract with the us department of state  which provided million of revenue in  ended in september  in our purchase agreement acquiring sytel we held back and retained million of the original purchase price for this contingency 
certain other contracts that concluded were small business contracts that were not renewed because sytel no longer qualified as a small business 
we are diligently working to replace the decline in revenue through our pursuit of new contract vehicles  particularly within the department of defense 
in this respect  we recently announced in february that we are a member of the dimensions international  inc team selected as one of the prime contractors on the us army s field and installation readiness support team first contract 
however  since the first contract is an indefinite delivery indefinite quantity contract  we may not realize any revenue under this contract in or future periods 
we also maintained a keen focus on existing contracts that were scheduled to expire in in which we had to recompete for the work and were recently successful in winning several significant recompete contracts

ford motor company our business with ford consists of help desk and desk side services  distributed server support  technical staffing  network management  and a specific project installing personal computers subcontracted through dell inc revenue generated through our business with ford decreased to million in  from million in and million in ford has announced a new business plan the way forward plan that will result in the reduction of its north american salaried work force by approximately percent  the equivalent of about  positions   of which occurred in and additional reductions occurred in february our largest contract with ford is our ford global spoc program  which is currently scheduled to expire in november under the spoc program  we provide a set of infrastructure support services under specific service level metrics  and we invoice ford based upon the number of seats we support 
the number of seats supported is determined bi annually on december and june of each year 
if certain contractual conditions are met  ford and techteam will have the right during each six month period to request one out of cycle seat adjustment 
ford continues to seek cost savings on its total cost of it infrastructure support  and we continue to support ford in finding ways to reduce its total cost 
under the spoc program renewal in december  we provided ford with a meaningful reduction in the price of our support through the redesign of our services  the way our services were performed  and the service levels  but our revenue from the spoc program remained relatively constant due to the expansion of the spoc program into new parts of the ford enterprise  such as jaguar and land rover 
we believe this process will continue throughout consequently  while we will lose seats from areas in ford where we currently provide service under the spoc program  we anticipate successfully expanding our coverage of the spoc program within ford to largely off set the decline in revenue caused by decline in seats supported 
although we cannot reliably predict the pace of ford s restructuring plan or our ability to expand our scope of work  we estimate that our total revenue from ford will decline approximately in from  without a material change in the gross profit margin earned from the business 
moreover  we do not believe that ford s financial condition will otherwise affect our business with ford or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford 
however  any failure to retain a significant amount of business with ford  or bankruptcy filing or other restructuring by ford  would have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity 
us federal government we conduct business under multiple contracts with various agencies and departments of the us federal government 
revenue generated through our business with the us federal government decreased to million in  from million in revenue from the us federal government of million in does not include revenue from sytel  which we acquired on january  the us federal government s fiscal year ends on september of each year 
it is not uncommon for us federal government agencies to award extra tasks or complete other contract actions in the weeks before the end of the fiscal year in order to avoid the loss of unexpended fiscal year funds 
moreover  in years when the us federal government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year  government operations typically are funded pursuant to a continuing resolution that authorizes agencies of the government to continue to operate  but traditionally does not authorize new spending initiatives 
when the us federal government operates pursuant to a continuing resolution  delays can occur in procurement of products and services  and such delays can affect our revenue  profit  and cash flow during the period of delay 
our recent contract award from the national institutes of health nih  office of information technology  contains an expansion of services and positions beyond levels 
at present  the us congress has only appropriated budgets for the department of defense and department of homeland security and has not appropriated the budget for nih 
therefore  we are not able to commence full work on the expanded services and positions until such budget is appropriated by congress and signed by the president  or until nih is able to reallocate current funds to these positions  should it able to do so 
as a result  we anticipate a delay before we are able to generate our full revenue under the expanded portion of this contract  but we will be able to perform at us federal government fiscal year funding levels under the congressionally approved continuing resolution

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not completed its analysis of the potential impact of fin on our financial position or results of operations

under the intrinsic value method  no share based compensation expense has been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for stock option awards with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant

under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized after the effective date includes compensation expense for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r

liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million at december   as compared to million at december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million in primarily due to million in payments to reduce long term debt  million in cash used for capital expenditures and  in earn out payments to the former shareholders of digital support corporation  partially offset by million in cash provided by operations and million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon exercise of stock options 
cash provided by operations of million in was generated primarily by income prior to non cash charges for depreciation and amortization of million and decreased from million in primarily due to a decrease in net income of million and additional working capital requirements of million 
we experienced a significant decrease in accounts payable during the decrease in accounts payable was primarily driven by payments made under certain contracts with the us department of homeland security dhs 
sytel serves as the prime contractor and electronic data systems corporation eds serves as its subcontractor 
eds performs in excess of of the work under the contract and creates the invoices  which sytel forwards to the dhs 
under the subcontract agreement between sytel and eds  sytel does not pay eds invoices until sytel receives payment from the dhs 
as a result  there may be sizable swings in our accounts receivable and accounts payable with a minimal impact on cash flow in the future 
long term cash requirements  other than for normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the continued expansion in europe and new expansion into the far east  enhancements of existing technologies  additional consideration that is or may become payable to the selling shareholders of previously acquired companies based on specific performance conditions and operating targets  possible repurchases of our common stock  possible payment of dividends and the possible acquisition of businesses complementary to our existing businesses 
we believe that positive cash flows from operations  together with existing cash balances  will continue to be sufficient to meet our ongoing operational requirements for the next twelve months and foreseeable future

critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements under gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  contingent liabilities  revenue recognition  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable at the time the estimates are made 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that our critical accounting policies that require more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition  deferred income taxes  accounts receivable  goodwill impairment  long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment  and business combinations 
revenue recognition under all situations  revenue is not recognized until earned  which is when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been provided  the revenue terms are fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we earn revenue under our it outsourcing services segment under one of the following four models time and material contracts under which we bill an agreed rate for each help desk agent based on the number of units ie  hours or days the individual agent worked during the month  per transaction contracts under which we bill an agreed rate per incident or call handled during a month or per minute for the length of the telephone call for the incident  fixed monthly fee contracts under which we agree to provide all of the agreed upon scheduled services on a monthly basis for a fixed monthly fee  and per seat contracts under which we agree to provide agreed upon scheduled services for a monthly fee that is determined by multiplying the number of users supported at the customer by the monthly per seat fee 
within the it outsourcing services segment  greater than of our services are delivered as a monthly service and not over multiple periods 
we also refer to our fixed fee and per seat contracts as managed service contracts 
many of our contracts that we bill on a per transaction basis contain a minimum monthly fee  which is derived by multiplying the agreed upon forecast of anticipated incidents by an agreed upon minimum percentage 
under this arrangement  we receive a minimum revenue amount for having committed to provide a specific level of staff to support the services projected during a month 
since we invoice the customer for the minimum fee and do not reduce future billings  we recognize the minimum fee as revenue in the month in which the incidents are below the customer s minimum forecast 
incident resolution usually occurs in the same month that incidents are reported 
under our managed service contracts  we generally do not incur material costs in a future month to complete a service obligation that arose in a prior month 
in those instances where our service obligation is not complete for a month and we expect to incur more than immaterial costs in a future month  we will defer an amount of revenue that represents the fair value of that service obligation 
revenue from all other services that we provide under our other operating segments government technology services  it consulting and systems integration  and other services may be categorized into two primary types time and material and fixed price 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenue in these business segments were time and material and were fixed price a substantial majority of which are fixed price level of effort contracts 
revenue is recognized under time and materials contracts as time is spent at hourly rates  which are negotiated with the customer  plus the cost of any allowable material costs and out of pocket expenses 
revenue is recognized under the majority of fixed price contracts  which are predominantly level of effort contracts  using the cost to cost method for all services provided 
in addition  we evaluate contracts for multiple deliverables  which may require the segmentation of each deliverable into separate accounting units for proper revenue recognition 
our contracts with agencies of the us federal government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the term of the contract as the services are provided 
from time to time we may proceed with work on unfunded portions of existing contracts based on customer direction pending finalization and signing of formal funding documents 
all revenue recognition is deferred during periods in which funding is not received 
allowable contract costs incurred during such periods are deferred if the receipt of funding is assessed as probable 
in evaluating the probability of funding being received  we consider our previous experience with the customer  communications with the customer regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  costs are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue under cost based us federal government contracts based on allowable contract costs  as mandated by the us federal government s cost accounting standards 
the costs we incur under us federal government contracts are subject to regulation and audit by certain agencies of the us federal government 
contract cost disallowances  resulting from government audits  have not historically been significant 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes represent temporary differences in the recognition of certain items for income tax and financial reporting purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets depends upon sufficient levels of future taxable income 
if at any time we believe that current or future taxable income does not support the realization of deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance is provided 
based on historical losses in belgium and romania  we have provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward in these countries 
we anticipate providing a valuation allowance for any future losses incurred in belgium and romania 
no valuation allowance has been recognized against other deferred tax assets  which are in the united states  as we believe it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized based on estimates of future taxable income  which have considered  among other factors  the future benefits of our recent acquisitions 
accounts receivable we periodically review our accounts receivable balances for collectibility based on a combination of historical experience and existing economic conditions 
the definition of delinquent accounts is based on the governing contractual terms 
delinquent accounts and balances are reserved when we determine they are more likely than not to become uncollectible 
our customers are generally large  well capitalized entities 
we generally do not require collateral and do not charge interest on past due balances 
we are not currently aware of major financial difficulties at any major customer and do not anticipate large uncollectible accounts in the future 
however  ford s long term debt rating was lowered to below investment grade status by standard poor s rating services during  and was downgraded further on march   by fitch ratings services 
at this time  we do not expect this downgrade to negatively affect our business with ford or the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford 
however  any bankruptcy filing by ford would have a material adverse effect on the collectibility of our accounts receivable from ford and our operating results and liquidity 
goodwill impairment goodwill relating to our acquisitions represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired  and has a carrying amount of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in goodwill in was related to the earn out payments for akela and ane 
we completed our annual impairment analyses at october  and  noting no indications of impairment for any of our reporting units 
at december   there have been no events or circumstances that would indicate an impairment test should be performed sooner than our annual test each october st 
long lived assets and identifiable intangible asset impairment the carrying amount of long lived assets and identifiable intangible assets was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of long lived and identifiable intangible assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balances may not be recoverable 
when factors or events indicate that such costs should be evaluated for possible impairment  we estimate the undiscounted cash flows of the assets over their remaining lives to evaluate whether the costs are recoverable 
such events could include  but are not limited to  the loss of a significant customer or contract  decreases in us federal government funding of certain programs  or other similar events 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued using certain software related to our help desk operations 
we expected no future cash flows related to the asset and  therefore  recorded an impairment loss equal to the net book value of the asset of  the impairment was recorded in our it outsourcing services segment 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that customization costs for certain software related to our help desk operations would not be utilized to deliver services to our customers or be used for any other purpose 
since we expected no future cash flows related to the customization  we recorded an impairment loss of  in our it outsourcing services segment  which represented the net book value of these costs 
business combinations we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  whereby the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognized at their estimated fair market values at the acquisition date 
the purchase price in excess of the estimated fair market value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired represents goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price related to our business combinations involves significant estimates and management judgment that may be adjusted during the allocation period  but in no case beyond one year from the acquisition date 
costs incurred related to successful business combinations are capitalized as costs of business combinations  while costs incurred by us for unsuccessful or terminated acquisition opportunities are expensed when we determine that such opportunities will no longer be pursued 
costs incurred related to probable business combinations are deferred 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are subject to market exposure from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not have any material market risk related to interest rates as our debt obligations have fixed interest rates 
we are subject to the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates due to our global operations as we provide services in the united states and europe 
as a result  our financial results and position could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets in which we provide services 
our operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and european currencies  specifically the european euro  british pound sterling  swedish kroner  and romanian lei 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our international subsidiaries into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not hedge operating translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
also  certain of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
as currency exchange rates change  our operating results will be affected by foreign currency transaction gains or losses on the receivable balance until it is collected 
we generally do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates related to trade receivables 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option or forward contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and european euro 
no derivatives  options contracts or similar instruments were outstanding at december  we do not enter into derivatives or similar instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december  and  our net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk were million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in net current assets from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be million and million at december  and  respectively 
approximately million and million of our trade receivables at our international subsidiaries at december  and  respectively  are denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the techteam entity that delivers the service 
the potential loss on trade receivables from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be  and  at december  and  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates yet exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency
