we employ approximately  people and sell more than  different specialty and general purpose products to over  customers in countries 
we provide value to our customers through our ability to link our knowledge of polymers and formulation technology with our manufacturing and supply chain to provide an essential link between large chemical producers our raw material suppliers and designers  assemblers and processors of plastics our customers 
recent developments sale of businesses and discontinued operations in february  we sold of our engineered films business for million 
this business is presented as a discontinued operation in these financial statements 
we maintain an ownership interest in this business that is reflected in our financial statements on the cost basis of accounting 
unless otherwise noted  disclosures contained in this annual report on form k relate to continuing operations 
for more information about our discontinued operations  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase of businesses in october  we purchased the remaining of our equity investment in dh compounding company from a wholly owned subsidiary of the dow chemical company for million 
our equity investment was previously reflected in the consolidated balance sheets on the line investment in equity affiliates 
dh compounding company is now consolidated in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and the results of operations are included in our consolidated statement of operations beginning october  dh compounding is included in our producer services operating segment 
in october  we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the vinyl compounding business and assets of ngai hing plastchem company ltd  a subsidiary of nhh 
in connection with this acquisition  we initiated the purchase of certain assets at a manufacturing facility in dongguan  china with a deposit of million 
this acquisition is expected to be completed during the first half of  subject to customary closing conditions 
restructuring initiatives and facility closures during the first quarter of  we completed the closure of our manchester  england color additives manufacturing facility to reduce costs and align capacity with market demand 
key customers product demand requirements were transitioned to other company facilities 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced the relocation of our commerce  california latex business to our massillon  ohio facility to better support the growth occurring in the latex business east of the mississippi river 
this transition will be completed in the first quarter of and resulted in charges related to employee separation and plant phaseout of approximately million 
sale of assets during  we sold previously closed facilities as part of our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction plans for a total of million 
results of operations summary of consolidated results income from continuing operations in improved by million  or per share  compared to sales increased by from  primarily due to increased volume in our international color and engineered materials  north american color and additives  north american engineered materials and producer services operating segments 
volume improvements in europe resulted from regaining market share that was lost in and from general improvement in key economies 
asian volume was up due to new application developments and further penetration into key markets 
domestic volume growth resulted primarily from strong demand in packaging  custom injection molding  appliance  construction  and wire and cable markets 
the sales increase was also driven by a shift in sales mix towards high value specialized applications  combined with higher selling prices that were required to offset higher raw material and energy costs 
improved earnings were primarily the result of margin expansion as we increased selling prices in a high raw material and energy cost escalation environment combined with strong earnings from our equity affiliates 
also impacting the year over year comparison were a million pre tax asset impairment charge in the third quarter of related to a previously idled chlor alkali facility at oxyvinyls and a million reversal of our deferred tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of polyone corporation in millions sales vinyl business international color and engineered materials polyone distribution all other corporate and eliminations total sales net income vinyl business international color and engineered materials polyone distribution resin and intermediates all other corporate and eliminations operating income interest expense interest income premium on early extinguishment of long term debt other expense  net income before income taxes and discontinued operations income tax benefit expense income before discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes net income year to year changes in sales and operating income are discussed in the segment information section that follows 
segments are also discussed in detail in note r to the consolidated financial statements 
selected operating costs selected operating costs  expressed as a percentage of sales  are as follows cost of sales selling and administrative costs cost of sales these costs include raw materials  plant conversion and distribution charges 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined in compared to primarily from the full year effect of efforts to increase our selling prices to pass on higher raw material  distribution and utility costs  as well as the effect of our specialization strategy to increase new higher value business 
cost of sales increased in from levels primarily as a result of raw material  transportation and energy cost increases that were not fully offset by selling price increases and manufacturing cost reduction initiatives 
selling and administrative these costs generally include selling  technology and general and administrative charges 
selling and administrative costs increased in compared to from higher share based compensation and incentive costs and increased investment in commercial resources and capabilities  partially offset by a higher benefit in than from legal and other related settlements 
selling and administrative costs declined in compared to from lower incentive costs combined with a higher benefit in compared to from legal and other related settlements 
employee separation and plant phaseout these costs represent severance  employee outplacement  lease termination  facility closing costs and the write down of the carrying value of plant and equipment resulting from the consolidation of operations  restructuring initiatives and executive separation agreements 
for more information about our employee separation and plant phaseout activities  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
asset impairments these charges are to adjust the carrying values of intangible assets and other investments to expected net future cash flows resulting from an evaluation that we perform each year end  or more often when indicators of impairment exist 
these non cash charges will not result in future cash expenditures 
in millions internet investments community development investments customer contract lower profit expectations environmental remediation at inactive sites these costs represent those charges associated with environmental remediation costs for manufacturing facilities that we either no longer own or that we closed in prior years 
we increased our reserves in based on increased estimates for future remediation at one site that we no longer own 
we increased our reserves significantly in to reflect a reduction in expected recoveries from an insurance company whose policies now only service remaining liabilities for groundwater remediation costs at a site that we no longer own and to recognize an increase over previous cost estimates for a remedial action work plan at an inactive site 
other components of income and expense following are discussions of significant components of income and expense that are presented below the line operating income 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense from year to year is largely the result of lower average borrowing levels 
payment of maturing debt and voluntary repurchases of debt are polyone corporation the main reasons for the continued decline in debt 
included in interest expense in and were charges of million and million  respectively  to write off deferred debt issuance costs that resulted from the early extinguishment of long term debt 
in the second and fourth quarters of  we repurchased million and million  respectively  of our senior notes 
the following table presents the quarterly average of short and long term debt for the past three years and the related interest expense in millions short term debt current portion of long term debt long term debt quarterly average interest expense premium on early extinguishment of long term debt cash expense from the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes in was million 
cash expense from the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our medium term notes and bank debentures in was million 
other expense  net finance costs associated with our receivables sale facility  foreign currency gains and losses  retained post employment benefit costs from previously discontinued operations and other miscellaneous items are as follows in millions currency exchange loss foreign exchange contracts gain loss discount on sale of trade receivables retained post employment benefit costs related to previously discontinued operations other income expense  net the decline in the discount on sale of trade receivables in compared to was primarily from the lower average balance of receivables that were sold during income tax expense the income tax expense benefit for  and  including changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance  is summarized as follows in millions tax expense prior to valuation allowance valuation allowance total tax benefit expense in calculating the tax expense or benefit prior to changes in the valuation allowance  the effect of the repatriation of foreign dividends was the principal cause of the difference between the effective and statutory tax rate for and for  the difference between the effective and statutory tax rate was principally the tax rates of foreign operations 
the deferred tax valuation allowance was recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets for recoverability 
this evaluation process is based upon the company s ability to demonstrate future taxable income that would result in utilization of those assets 
as a result of a review in the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was more likely than not that the majority of our deferred tax assets were impaired and  accordingly  a valuation allowance was recorded 
subsequent to  the valuation allowance was either increased to offset the creation of additional deferred tax assets  as was the case in  or reduced for use of deferred tax assets in and in  the valuation allowance was reduced by million as a result of the following factors a million for the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  b million associated with changes in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the pension and post retirement health care liabilities  and c million associated with our determination that it is now more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the domestic deferred tax valuation allowance was at december  the resulting tax expense for the years ended december   and includes foreign  state and alternative minimum tax 
income taxes are discussed in detail in note p to the consolidated financial statements 
loss from discontinued operations  net of income taxes discontinued operations are discussed in detail in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the loss from discontinued operations included a pre tax benefit of million in and a pre tax charge of million in for employee separation and plant phaseout costs from restructuring initiatives and closing certain manufacturing facilities of the engineered films and elastomers and performance additives businesses 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  the losses from discontinued operations  shown below  do not include any depreciation or amortization expense 
polyone corporation in millions sales elastomers and performance additives engineered films pre tax income from operations elastomers and performance additives engineered films pre tax charges to adjust net assets of businesses held for sale to projected net sale proceeds elastomers and performance additives engineered films income tax expense net of valuation allowance loss from discontinued operations segment information compared with in millions change change sales vinyl business international color and engineered materials polyone distribution all other corporate and eliminations operating income loss vinyl business international color and engineered materials polyone distribution resin and intermediates all other corporate and eliminations change operating income loss as a percentage of sales vinyl business points international color and engineered materials points polyone distribution points all other points total points effective with the first quarter of  our operating and reportable segments changed 
the producer services operating segment was formed at the start of from portions of the north american color and additives and the north american engineered materials operating segments 
as a result  the north american color and additives operating segment no longer meets  nor is expected to meet  any of the quantitative thresholds that would require separate disclosure as a reportable segment  and  accordingly  it is included in the all other segment 
the new producer services operating segment also does not meet  nor is expected to meet  any of these quantitative thresholds  and  as a result  it is also included in the all other segment 
effective with the fourth quarter of  the former specialty resins operating segment was subsumed into the former vinyl compounds operating segment to create the new vinyl business operating and reportable segment 
segment information for prior periods has been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
operating income is the primary financial measure that is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segment and assessing its performance 
operating income at the segment level does not include corporate general and administrative costs that are not allocated to segments  intersegment sales and profit eliminations  charges related to specific strategic initiatives  such as the consolidation of operations  restructuring activities  including employee separation costs resulting from personnel reduction programs  plant closure and phaseout costs  executive separation agreements  share based compensation costs  asset impairments  environmental remediation costs for facilities no longer owned or closed in prior years  gains and losses on the divestiture of joint ventures and equity investments  and certain other items that are not included in the measure of segment profit or loss that is reported to and reviewed by the chief operating decision maker 
these costs are included in corporate and eliminations 
vinyl business sales were flat in compared to as higher average selling prices offset lower volume 
selling prices at the beginning of reflected the increases that we realized in the fourth quarter of volume was down as a result of slower building and construction market demand in the second half of compared with the unusually high demand in the second half of due to the rebuilding activities that were created in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita 
also negatively impacting volume was greater competition from overseas suppliers who increased their market share  largely in flooring applications  polyone corporation in the second half of operating income increased million primarily from price driven margin improvements 
international color and engineered materials sales increased due primarily to the strengthening of foreign economies and an improvement in our customer portfolio 
sales in europe increased from recapturing market share  increased sales of higher margin specialty products in the wire and cable and automotive markets  continued growth in eastern european countries and strong results in the packaging market 
sales in asia increased primarily from growth in the higher margin appliance and electrical and electronics markets  the introduction of new product lines and the development of the south korean market 
in addition  favorable currency exchange rates contributed approximately million to the sales increase 
volume also rose in operating income increased million  or from  primarily as a result of higher volume  a shift in mix to higher margin products and an increase in selling prices 
differences in average currency exchange rates did not materially impact earnings 
polyone distribution s sales increased led by an increase in selling prices and  to a lesser extent  a increase in volume 
the increase in selling prices was driven by both passing through increases from our supplier base and from a shift in mix towards higher priced engineered products 
the change in volume was a result of gains from our national account programs that were mostly offset by a softening demand in the building and construction and automotive markets in the second half of operating income decreased million in due to increased investment in commercial resources 
hurricanes katrina and rita caused a surge in demand in that temporarily increased selling prices and margins  both of which have returned to normalized levels in as demand has softened 
resin and intermediates operating income increased million  or  over oxyvinyls equity earnings increased million primarily due to higher industry average pvc resin and vcm price spreads over raw material costs 
sunbelt s equity earnings increased million due to higher selling prices for chlorine and caustic soda that were driven by strong demand 
the all other segment includes the north american color and additives  north american engineered materials  producer services and polymer coating systems operating segments 
sales in aggregate were up from a higher value sales mix and higher shipment volumes 
north american colors and additives sales improved due to higher average selling prices and a increase in volume 
the increase in sales was a result of higher selling prices to recapture increases in raw material costs as well as the result of improvements in manufacturing and new technologies 
the volume increases were in the packaging  custom injection molding and profile extrusion markets 
north american engineered materials sales increased from a resurgence in the wire and cable market and continued improvement in the general purpose product lines 
in addition  we expanded our market position as a leading compounder of specialized formulations and materials 
new technology platforms have been introduced that complement our new plant established to focus on specialized compounding 
increases in commercial resources have and will continue to create better leverage for our domestic and global capabilities to meet customer needs 
producer services sales increased from continued strong demand in the pipe market  penetration of new markets and new business resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in dh compounding company in the fourth quarter of the acquisition of dh compounding company enabled us to offer a broader range of blends and alloys materials that serve the medical  food and consumer markets 
polymer coating systems sales increased in compared to from increased sales of higher priced products such as inks and specialty colorants  the introduction of new products  higher selling prices  and continued growth in china 
these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in volume 
volume decreased due to a combination of slower order patterns at existing customers and the conclusion of several large automotive programs at the end of operating income in for the all other segment improved million compared to corporate and eliminations expense of million in was million lower than in the primary drivers of this improvement include the elimination of charges in related to the impairment of a previously idled facility at oxyvinyls that amounted to million in  an increase of million in for benefits received from insurance and legal settlements and changes to the related reserves  and a net charge of in as compared to million in related to employee separation and plant phaseout costs 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in share based compensation and employee incentive costs of million  pension costs of million  administrative personnel costs of million  and net insurance costs of million

volume was down due to softer demand in virtually all markets except custom extrusions and fittings 
the majority of our customers experienced softer market conditions  which negatively affected their demand for our products 
this decline in volume was partially offset by new business obtained in custom extrusion and wire and cable applications 
operating income fell million primarily from the volume decline and higher raw material and energy costs 
international color and engineered materials sales increased by from higher average selling prices from efforts to recapture raw material cost increases  combined with favorable euro to us dollar currency exchange rates totaling approximately million 
the sale of the melos rubber granules business negatively affected the year over year revenue comparison by percentage points 
volume declined in compared to the may sale of the melos rubber granules business accounted for percentage points of the year over year volume decline 
the balance of the volume decline was primarily the result of weakness in demand for certain engineered materials applications and a general weakness in european plastics markets that was partially offset by higher volume in asia 
in the second quarter of  we began operations at our new manufacturing facility in shenzhen  china 
this plant manufactures engineered material compounds  color compounds and plastisol inks 
the sales and operating income associated with plastisol inks are reported within the all other segment 
operating income declined by million largely reflecting increased competition experienced in the european engineered materials markets 
energy related operating costs negatively affected earnings  and selling price increases did not fully offset strong raw material cost increases 
the sale of melos negatively impacted earnings compared with by million 
polyone distribution s sales were up driven by selling price increases and a shift in product mix toward higher priced products 
volume declined  primarily in commodity resins  which was consistent with the general softening across the north american plastics industry during the second quarter 
operating income improved by million 
the effect of lower volumes and material cost increases were offset by higher selling prices 
resin and intermediates operating income increased million primarily as a result of a million increase in sunbelt s earnings contribution and a million increase from oxyvinyls 
oxyvinyls benefited from higher industry average pvc resin and vcm product spreads that resulted from favorable supply and demand dynamics and improved chlor alkali profitability as compared to this benefit was tempered in the third quarter of by the adverse impact of the combination of hurricane related production interruptions and significant increases in ethylene and natural gas costs 
sunbelt s earnings improvement was largely from significantly higher combined selling prices for chlorine and caustic soda that were driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics 
the all other segment includes the north american color and additives  north american engineered materials  producer services and polymer coating systems operating segments 
sales improved despite a decline in volume 
the producer services operating segment was formed at the start of from portions of the north american color and additives and north american engineered materials operating segments 
as such  data for producer services for is not available  preventing a comparison of results between and for this operating segment 
therefore  the following discussion combines these three operating segments  north american color and additives  north american engineered materials and producer services  for purposes of comparing results with polymer coating systems  the other operating segment within the all other segment  was not affected 
sales for the north american color and additives  north american engineered materials and producer services operating polyone corporation segments were up by in compared to despite a decline in volume 
the decline in volume resulted from lower demand in the packaging  pipe and fittings  film applications  and general purpose and contract manufactured automotive applications markets  partially offset by an increase in volume in the construction market 
higher average selling prices that resulted from efforts to recapture raw material cost increases  combined with a shift in product mix towards higher value added products  drove the sales increase 
polymer coating systems sales were up  though volume was down primarily due to a decline in automotive demand caused by reduced production schedules and platform build outs 
some customers with their own compounding capability also decided to bring the manufacture of a portion of their plastisol requirements in house  which reduced our volume 
higher average selling prices drove the sales increase 
operating income in for the all other segment decreased by million primarily due to a lower volume and from higher polyethylene and additives raw material costs that were not fully recaptured in price increases due to competitive pressures 
corporate and eliminations expense of million in was million lower than in the primary drivers for this improvement include a net decrease of million as a result of decreases in legal and insurance reserves combined with legal settlements  a decrease in net environmental costs of million associated with inactive or formerly owned sites  a decrease of million in share based compensation and employee incentive costs  a decrease in pension costs of million  and the elimination of the loss on sale of assets of million that occurred in these improvements were not fully offset by the recognition of a charge of million related to the impairment of a previously idled facility at oxyvinyls in and an increase of million in charges related to employee separation and plant phaseout activities in compared to impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  we believe it remains a factor in our economy and we continually seek ways to lessen its impact 
toward that end  we deploy three primary mitigating strategies a within the context of competitive markets  we offset higher raw material and energy costs by increasing the prices of our products to customers over time  b we are improving our ability to sell higher valued specialized materials  services and solutions to our customers where price is determined by value received by the customer rather than by changes to cost inputs  and c we are implementing specific efficiency programs such as lean six sigma  energy conservation initiatives  and inventory and distribution cost optimization programs  that are expected to lower our delivered cost of product to customers  helping to negate portions of the detrimental effect of inflation 
additionally  we use the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for of our inventories and the first in  first out fifo or average cost method for the remainder 
under the lifo method  the cost of products sold that are reported in the financial statements approximates current costs  providing a better match of current period revenue and expenses 
charges to operations for depreciation represent the allocation of historical costs incurred over past years and are lower than if they were based on the current cost of the productive capacity that is being consumed 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are described more fully in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
sales discounts and rebates sales discounts and rebates are offered to certain customers to promote customer loyalty and to encourage greater product sales 
these programs provide customers with credits against their purchases if they attain pre established volumes or revenue milestones for a specific period 
we estimate the provision for rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement at the time of shipment and an estimate of the customer s future achievement of the respective volume or revenue milestones 
the actual amounts earned can differ from these estimates 
in the past  the actual amounts earned by our customers have not differed materially from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions about their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of each customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
we regularly analyze significant customer accounts and record a specific reserve to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
we also record reserves for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  economic conditions and our historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the collectibility of receivables may be adjusted further 
in the past  the actual losses incurred have differed from our estimates polyone corporation primarily as a result of unforeseen bankruptcy filings by our customers 
environmental accrued liability based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
we do not believe that any of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow beyond the amount accrued 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from an increase in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
for more information about our environmental liabilities  see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos related claims we have been named in various lawsuits involving multiple claimants and defendants for alleged asbestos exposure in the past by  among others  workers and contractors and their families at plants owned by us or our predecessors  or on board ships owned or operated by us or our predecessors 
we have reserves totaling million as of december  for asbestos related claims that are probable and estimable 
we believe that the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued could be materially adverse to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
this belief is based on our ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the specific claims and our defenses and insurance coverage available for these claims  as well as the probability and expected magnitude of reasonably anticipated future asbestos related claims 
our assessment includes whether the pleadings allege exposure to asbestos  asbestos containing products or premises exposure  the severity of the plaintiffs alleged injuries from exposure to asbestos or asbestos containing products and the length and certainty of exposure on our premises  to the extent disclosed in the pleadings or identified through discovery  whether the named defendant related to us manufactured or sold asbestos containing products  the outcomes of cases recently resolved  and the historical pattern of the number of claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances change in the future  we will modify our reserves  as appropriate 
the amount of this accrual has not materially changed over the past several years 
restructuring related accruals since polyone was formed in  we have recorded accruals for charges in connection with restructuring our businesses  as well as integrating acquired businesses 
these accruals include estimates related to employee separation costs  the closure and or consolidation of facilities  contractual obligations and the value of assets such as property  plant and equipment  and inventories 
actual amounts could differ from the original estimates  and have differed in the past primarily from differences between estimated and actual net proceeds received upon the sale of property  plant and equipment 
restructuring related accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to these accruals are made when changes to plans occur 
changes to restructuring plans for existing businesses are recorded as employee separation and plant phaseout costs in the period when the change occurs 
for more information about our restructuring activities  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
these tests must be done at least once a year  and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or a decline in value may have occurred 
we test for goodwill impairment on july of each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires us to make judgments about the assumptions that we use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable marketplace data from within a consistent industry grouping  and the cost of capital 
we compare these estimated fair values with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict what future events might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill 
these events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in relationships with significant customers 
for more information about our goodwill  see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes estimates of full year taxable income are used in the tax rate calculations for the legal entities and jurisdictions in which we operate throughout the year and these estimates may change during the year to reflect evolving facts and circumstances 
during the year  we use judgment to estimate our income polyone corporation for the year 
because judgment is involved  the tax rate may increase or decrease significantly in any period 
to determine income or loss for financial statement purposes  we make estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets that result from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires us to reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in the process of determining our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all of the available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
to estimate future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pre tax income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment to forecast future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our businesses 
as a result of our conclusions at december   we recorded a million reversal of our valuation allowance 
this amount is comprised of million for the current year utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  million associated with changes in accumulated other comprehensive income related to pension and post retirement health care benefit liabilities and a million reversal of the valuation allowance associated with our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities deals with uncertainties in applying complex tax regulations in a large number of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of the extent to which additional taxes may be due 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted 
for more information about our income taxes  see note p to the consolidated financial statements 
pensions and post retirement benefits effective december   we adopted sfas no 
sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans in their balance sheets 
this is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation of the plans the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the change in the funded status of the plans must be recognized in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we accounted for our defined benefit post retirement plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
any adjustment to this liability was recorded as a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
sfas no 
required that the liability that was recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 any change in the funded status was not immediately recognized 
instead  they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of our post retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  the net impact of accounting for sfas no 
was an increase of million on a pre tax basis and a decrease of million on an after tax basis to our accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment of million to increase accumulated other comprehensive loss to record our proportionate share of oxyvinyls adoption of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  or for any prior period 
also  the adoption of sfas no 
does not affect any financial covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt and our receivables sale facility and is not expected to affect operating results in future periods 
we have several pension plans  of which only two continue to accrue benefits for certain us employees 
these two plans generally provide benefit payments using a formula that is based upon employee compensation and length of service 
length of service for determining benefit payments was frozen as of december  all us defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants 
regarding our other post employment benefit plans  only certain employees hired prior to december  are eligible to participate 
included in our results of operations are significant pension and post retirement benefit costs that we measure using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  when making these assumptions 
changes in pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return polyone corporation on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we consider the duration of the plan liabilities and give more weight to equity investments than to fixed income securities 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased our net pension and post retirement expense by approximately million 
likewise  a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased our net pension cost by approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the value of future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased accumulated other comprehensive income and the related pension and post retirement liability by approximately million as of december  the rate of increase in medical costs that we assume for the next five years was held constant with prior years to reflect both our actual experience and projected expectations 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage increase or decrease in the health care cost trend rate would have increased or decreased our net periodic benefit cost by million and our accumulated other comprehensive income and the related post retirement liability by approximately million as of december  for more information about our pensions and post retirement benefits  see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation prior to january   as provided under sfas no 
 we applied apb no 
and related interpretations to account for our share based compensation plans 
under apb no 
 compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price of the grant was below the fair value of the underlying stock at the measurement date 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of the grant 
we are using the modified prospective transition method  which does not require prior period financial statements to be restated 
the impact on pre tax earnings from adopting sfas no 
r for the year ended december  was a charge of million 
the option pricing model that we used to value the stock appreciation rights granted during was a monte carlo simulation method 
under this method  the fair value of awards on the date of grant is an estimate and is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
expected volatility was set at the average of the six year historical weekly volatility for our common stock and the implied volatility rates for exchange traded options 
the expected term of options that were granted was set equal to halfway between the vesting and expiration dates for each grant 
dividends were not included in this calculation because we do not currently pay dividends 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of the grant 
forfeitures were estimated at per year based on our historical experience 
for more information on the adoption and impact of sfas no 
r  see note c and note q to the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to various investigations  claims  and legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
any liability that may result from these proceedings that we judge to be probable and estimable has been accrued

cash flows detail about cash flows can be found in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
the following discussion focuses on the material components of cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities 
operating activities in  our operations provided million of cash 
the primary sources of cash were profitable business operations  a decline in accounts receivable due to lower sales levels at the end of compared with the prior year  and cash distributions that we received from our equity investments 
primary uses of cash included cash payments for interest and income taxes  an increase in inventories due to the slower than expected sales volume at the end of the year  and a decrease in accounts payable at the end of the year 
cash used by discontinued operations was million 
in  our operations provided million of cash 
primary sources of cash were profitable business operations  a decline in inventories from improved inventory turnover  an increase in accounts payable due to higher purchasing levels to support higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  cash distributions that we received from our equity investments  and short term borrowings under our receivables sale facility 
primary uses of cash were cash payments for environmental remediation at inactive sites  cash payments for interest and income taxes  an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  and the payment of employee bonuses that had been accrued at the end of that were greater than those that were accrued at the end of cash provided by discontinued operations was million 
in  our operations used million of cash 
primary sources of cash were profitable business operations  an increase in accounts payable due to a higher purchasing levels to support higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  combined with longer payment terms  and cash distributions that we received from our equity investments 
primary uses of cash were cash payments for employee separation and plant closure initiatives  cash payments for interest and income taxes  an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales levels at the end of the year compared to the prior year  the repayment of short term borrowings under our receivables sale facility  and a million voluntary contribution to a defined benefit pension plan 
cash provided by discontinued operations was million 
working capital management our working capital management focus is on three metrics that we believe are the most critical to maximizing cash provided by operating activities 
these three metrics measure the number of days of sales in receivables dso  and the days of cost of goods sold in inventories dsi and accounts payable dsp 
these metrics allow us to better understand the total dollar changes in the three dollar components of working capital by isolating the effects of sales and production levels in the business versus management s efforts to drive more efficient use of company funds 
the following table presents our working capital metrics and the impact of changes in efficiency and volume on accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable accounts receivable dso inventories dsi accounts payable dsp average annual net days change in net days from prior year end compared to  average annual net days improved days as management initiatives around working capital demonstrated continued improvement 
comparing versus  dso and dsi performance improved days collectively  offset by a less favorable performance in dsp 
in millions cash provided used by accounts receivable inventories accounts payable impact of change in net days impact of change in sales and production levels from december  to december   million of cash was consumed in working capital investment driven by higher inventories and lower payables 
year end demand was significantly above typical seasonal levels and caused a larger than expected reduction in inventories reflecting heightened customer demand following the severe storms in the us gulf coast 
conversely  at the end of  demand softened resulting in a relatively higher year end inventory levels 
the decline in accounts payable was due to lower purchases during december of higher sales levels during used million of cash from operating activities to fund the increase in sales from to effective working capital programs  however  resulted in a minimal overall increase of net days outstanding over the same time period 
this contributed million to cash provided by operating activities  holding the increase in our total investment in receivables  inventory and payables from the effect of higher sales levels to a minimum 
investing activities in  we used million for investing activities  primarily for capital spending in support of polyone corporation manufacturing operations 
this use of cash was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our engineered films business 
capital spending in as a percentage of depreciation was 
cash used by discontinued operations was million 
in  we used million for investing activities  reflecting capital spending in support of manufacturing operations  the purchase of the remaining of star color  a thailand based color and additives business  and the purchase of certain assets of novatec plastics corporation 
star color is included in our international color and engineered materials segment  and novatec s assets are included in our vinyl business segment 
this capital spending was partially offset by proceeds that we received from the sale of previously closed facilities 
capital spending as a percentage of depreciation was in cash used by discontinued operations was million 
in  we generated million from investing activities  largely from the sale of our elastomers and performance additives business and our european melos rubber granules business 
melos was formerly included in our international color and engineered materials segment 
elastomers and performance additives was a separate segment that was reclassified as a discontinued operation as of december  this cash generation was partially offset by capital spending in support of manufacturing operations and the acquisition of the north american distribution business of resindirect llc  which is included in our polyone distribution segment 
capital spending as a percentage of depreciation in was 
cash used by discontinued operations was million 
financing activities cash used by financing activities in  and was primarily for the extinguishment of debt 
discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately on a single line in each section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the absence of future cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to materially affect future liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheets the following discussion focuses on material changes in balance sheet line items from december  to december  that are not discussed in the preceding cash flows section 
other non current assets the increase of million was primarily due to the recording of a note receivable of million resulting from the sale of our engineered films business in february accrued expenses the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in accrued employee benefit costs  including incentives and vacation benefits  partially offset by a reduction in accrued payroll taxes and accrued income taxes 
post retirement benefits other than pensions the reduction of million was due to the adoption of sfas no 
and an increase in the discount rate to determine the liability for other post employment benefits opebs  both of which resulted in a decrease in the liability for opebs 
other non current liabilities including pensions the reduction of million was primarily due to a decrease in the pension liability of million that resulted primarily from an increase in the discount rate at december   partially offset by an increase of million in non current environmental reserves 
the remaining decrease in other non current liabilities including pensions is comprised of other less significant account changes such as employment costs  insurance accruals and other reserves 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity is defined as an enterprise s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs 
these needs include paying obligations as they mature  maintaining production capacity and providing for planned growth 
capital resources are sources of funds other than those generated by operations 
we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  events  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing to the extent that it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of december   we had existing facilities to access available capital resources receivables sale facility  uncommitted short term credit lines and senior unsecured notes and debentures totaling million 
as of december   we had used million of these facilities  and million was available to be drawn while remaining in compliance with all facilities 
in addition  at december   we could incur additional secured debt in an amount up to million while remaining in compliance with the debt coverage limit contained in the guarantee and agreement  discussed in the section titled revolving credit facility below 
as of december   we also had a million cash and cash equivalents balance that exceeded our typical operating cash requirements of million to million  adding to our available liquidity 
the following table summarizes our available and outstanding facilities at december  in millions outstanding available long term debt  including current maturities receivables sale facility short term debt long term debt at december   long term debt totaled million  with maturities ranging from to current maturities of long term debt at december  were million 
during  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due at a premium of million 
this premium is shown as a separate line item in the consolidated statements of operations 
unamortized deferred note issuance costs of million were expensed due to this repurchase and are included in interest polyone corporation expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also made a payment of million of aggregate principal amount of our medium term notes which matured during as part of our purchase of dh compounding company during the fourth quarter  we issued a promissory note in the principal amount of million  payable in equal installments at a rate of per annum 
during  we made principal payments totaling million on this promissory note 
for more information about our debt  see note g to the consolidated financial statements 
revolving credit facility we decided not to renew our revolving credit facility  and  accordingly  it expired on june  to replace some of the features of this expired facility  we entered into a definitive guarantee and agreement with citicorp usa  inc on june  under this guarantee and agreement  we guarantee the treasury management and banking services provided to us and our subsidiaries  such as subsidiary borrowings  interest rate swaps  foreign currency forwards  letters of credit  credit card programs and bank overdrafts 
this guarantee is secured by our inventories located in the united states 
receivables sale facility our receivables sale facility will expire in july our receivables sale facility allows us to sell accounts receivable and obtain proceeds of up to million 
the maximum proceeds that we may receive is limited to of the eligible domestic accounts receivable sold 
this facility also makes up to million available for issuing standby letters of credit  of which million was used at december  the receivables sale facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio defined as adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures  divided by interest expense and scheduled debt repayments for the next four quarters of at least to when availability under the facility is million or less 
as of december   the fixed charge coverage ratio was to and availability under the facility was million 
of the capital resource facilities available to us as of december   the portion of the receivables sale facility that was actually sold provided security for the transfer of ownership of these receivables 
each indenture governing our senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes allows a specific level of secured debt  above which security must be provided on each indenture and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
the receivables sale facility and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes are not considered debt under the covenants associated with our senior unsecured notes and debentures 
as of december   we had not sold any accounts receivable and had guaranteed million of our sunbelt equity affiliate s debt 
the following table summarizes our obligations under long term debt  operating leases  standby letters of credit  interest obligations  pension and post retirement obligations  guarantees and purchase obligations as of december  payment due by period less than more than in millions total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt operating leases standby letters of credit interest obligations pension and post retirement obligations guarantees purchase obligations total interest obligations are stated at the rate of interest that is defined by the debt instrument and take into effect any impact of rate swap agreements  assuming that the debt is paid at maturity 
pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
based upon our interpretation of the new pension regulations  there will be minimum funding requirements in of approximately million for our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
obligations are based on the plans current funded status and actuarial assumptions  and include funding requirements projected to be made to our qualified pension plans  projected benefit payments to participants in our other post employment benefit plans  and projected benefit payments to participants in our non qualified pension plans through we expect that profitable operations in will enable us to maintain existing levels of available capital resources and meet our cash requirements 
expected sources of cash in include net income  additional borrowings under existing loan agreements  cash distributions from equity affiliates and proceeds from the sale of previously closed facilities and redundant assets 
expected uses of cash in include interest expense and discounts on the sale of accounts receivable  cash taxes  a contribution to a defined benefit pension plan  capital expenditures  early extinguishment of a portion of long term debt and the retirement of medium term notes maturing in capital expenditures are currently estimated to be between and million in  primarily to support strategic growth initiatives and manufacturing operations 
cash expenditures for environmental remediation in future years are expected to be generally consistent with levels 
based on current projections  we believe that we should be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures and that cash provided by operating activities  along with available borrowing capacity under our receivables sale facility  should allow us to maintain adequate levels of available capital resources to fund our operations and meet debt service and minimum pension funding requirements for both the short and long term 
polyone corporation related party transactions we purchase a substantial portion of our pvc resin and all of our vcm raw materials under supply agreements with oxyvinyls  a equity owned company 
these agreements have an initial term of years  commencing may   and we have the right to renew these agreements for two five year periods 
we have also entered into various service agreements with oxyvinyls 
net amounts owed to oxyvinyls  primarily for raw material purchases  totaled million at december  and million at december  our total purchases of raw materials from oxyvinyls were million during and million during off balance sheet arrangements receivables sale facility we sell our accounts receivable to polyone funding corporation pfc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
at december   accounts receivable totaling million were sold to pfc and  as a result  they are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
pfc in turn sells an undivided interest in these accounts receivable to certain investors and realizes proceeds of up to million 
the maximum proceeds that pfc may receive under the facility is limited to of the eligible accounts receivable sold to pfc 
at december   pfc had not sold any of its undivided interests in accounts receivable 
we retained an interest in the million of trade receivables sold by us to pfc 
as a result  this retained interest is included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we believe that available funding under our receivables sale facility provides us increased flexibility to manage working capital requirements and is an important source of liquidity 
for more information about our receivables sale facility  see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantee of indebtedness of others as discussed in note n to the consolidated financial statements  we guarantee million of unconsolidated equity affiliate debt of sunbelt in connection with the construction of a chlor alkali facility in mcintosh  alabama 
this debt guarantee matures in letters of credit we maintain approximately million letters of credit under the receivables sale facility 
these letters of credit are issued by the bank in favor of third parties and are mainly related to insurance claims and interest rate swap agreements 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
outlook we anticipate that the north american market and operating environment experienced during the last half of will continue into early  as the industrial slowdown we experienced is projected to continue through the first half 
sales demand was sluggish at the end  reflecting softening in the building and construction  automotive and consumer durables eg  appliance markets 
pockets of strengthening demand have been seen  but it is premature to view them as sustainable and predictive of a broader rebound 
overall industrial production is projected to moderate approximately percentage points to compared to automobile production is also projected to soften compared to the leading construction index  on the other hand  started to show signs of improvement in the fourth quarter of while it is too early to suggest a strong uptrend  it is encouraging for a rebound in late spring moreover  the leading home price index is also rising 
if this advance continues  it would point to the bottom in home prices as early as late spring 
this would also likely bolster consumer confidence and spending 
sustained lower energy prices to the consumer  at least compared to the two previous years  should also strengthen confidence with the attendant beneficial impacts on the overall economy 
with this backdrop  we do not anticipate a material change to long term north american plastic consumption growth trends of to in after having strengthened markedly in  eurozone economic growth  in terms of gross domestic product gdp and industrial production  is projected to moderate in this trend is expected to be generally mirrored in our principal market economies of germany  france  united kingdom and benelux 
spain  on the other hand  is expected to experience continued strong economic growth in of approximately after growth in the primary economies in eastern europe are projected to experience gdp growth between and times that of western europe 
plastics consumption growth in western europe is projected to remain in the to range  whereas eastern europe plastic consumption is expected to remain in the high single digits 
additionally  per capita plastics consumption is approximately kilograms in eastern europe  only of the kilogram consumption experienced in western europe 
gdp growth for key asian economies in is projected to moderate compared to gdp growth in china is projected to be to 
industrial production is projected to be approximately higher than gdp growth rates 
plastics growth for asean is projected at to  and plastics growth in china is projected at in the aggregate  with regional differences accounting for growth rates that range between and 
our target is to grow sales to annually  well in excess of market growth rates  through organic programs and entry into new markets and geographies 
even though margin pressures experienced across most business segments at the end of are not expected to abate in the near term  we project improved gross margins in due to more effective pricing  an improved sales mix through specialization and accelerated rates of higher value new business closes 
gross margins will also benefit from sourcing leverage and operating efficiencies resulting from lean six sigma implementation 
it is also noteworthy that fourth quarter pricing actions should provide a degree of margin momentum entering  despite market pressures being exerted on our businesses 
polyone corporation chlorovinyl and derivative hydrocarbon costs are projected to decline from cycle peaks realized in this trend began in the third quarter of and is expected to continue through natural gas  on the other hand  is projected to average moderately higher in compared to aggregate chlorine and caustic prices are projected to fall  adversely impacting earnings in resin and intermediates 
based on these expectations  the overall net chlorovinyl chain margin drivers are expected to negatively impact operating income in listed below are some of the priorities that we have identified for transform our culture towards specialization to drive additional sales of new high margin business by having a customer first focus 
improve gross margins through value pricing  upgrading sales mix  developing differentiated new product technologies and closing more new high value business across each operating business 
implement initiatives that drive our key strategies specialization shift basis of competition to differentiation from a cost and commodity orientation  globalization leverage our global competitive advantages  operational excellence drive cultural change to address and answer the voice of customer relentlessly  and commercial excellence improve effectiveness of sales  marketing and innovation resources to strengthen our value proposition to sell valued solutions  not products 
restore profitability and reposition north american engineered materials further into being a high value custom specialty business 
deliver meaningful progress toward re establishing north american color and additives profitability 
further strengthen our financial profile
