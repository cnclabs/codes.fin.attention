significant changes in one or more of these considerations may require adjustments to the allowance affecting net income and net carrying value of accounts receivable 
at june   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million as compared to million at june  impairment of investments the company holds a portfolio of investment securities and periodically assesses its recoverability 
in the event of a decline in fair value of an investment  the judgment is made whether the decline is other than temporary 
management s assessment as to the nature of a decline is largely based on the duration of that market decline  financial health of and specific prospects for the issuer  and the company s cash requirements and intent to hold the investment 
if an investment is impaired and the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary  an appropriate write down is recorded 
the company recognized investment impairment of less than million in fiscal and  and million in fiscal inventories the company carries all its inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor  and overhead associated with such inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods held for sale 
provisions for obsolete or slow moving inventories are recorded based upon regular analysis of stock rotation  obsolescence  and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demands  change in the industry  or market conditions differ from management s estimates  additional provisions may be necessary 
the company recorded inventory obsolescence and overstock provisions of million  million  and million in fiscal   and  respectively  which were included in cost of sales 
the provisions were principally for obsolete and slow moving parts 
the parts were written down to estimated realizable value 
long lived and intangible assets the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amounts of its long lived assets  including software  property  plant and equipment 
the company assesses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the possibility of long lived assets being impaired when events trigger the likelihood 
impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected cash flows to be derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
if impairment exists  the carrying value of the impaired asset is written down and impairment loss is recorded in operating results 
in assessing the potential impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  management makes significant estimates and assumptions regarding the discounted future cash flows to determine the fair value of the respective assets on an annual basis 
these 
table of contents estimates and their related assumptions include  but are not limited to  projected future operating results  industry and economy trends  market discount rates  indirect expense allocations  and tax rates 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy  company profitability  or market conditions  among other factors  this could adversely affect future goodwill and other intangible assets valuations and result in impairment charges 
effective june   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement changed the accounting for goodwill and indefinite lived assets from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach 
the company performs its impairment test as of the third quarter of each fiscal year 
the company did not find any indication that an impairment existed and  therefore  no impairment loss was recorded in fiscal warranties the company offers warranties for specific products it manufactures 
the company also provides extended warranties for some products it sells that lengthen the period of coverage specified in the manufacturer s original warranty 
terms generally range from one to three years 
the company estimates the cost to perform under its warranty obligation and recognizes this estimated cost at the time of the related product sale 
the company reports this expense as an element of cost of sales in its consolidated statement of operations 
each quarter  the company assesses actual warranty costs incurred  on a product by product basis  as compared to its estimated obligation 
the estimates with respect to new products are based generally on knowledge of the products and are extrapolated to reflect the extended warranty period  and are refined each quarter as better information with respect to warranty experience becomes known 
warranty reserves are established for costs that are expected to be incurred after the sale and delivery of products under warranty 
the warranty reserves are determined based on known product failures  historical experience  and other currently available evidence 
stock compensation effective june   the company adopted sfas no 
r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options 
the company estimates fair value using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life  and dividends 
compensation cost is recognized using a graded vesting schedule over the applicable vesting period  or date on which retirement eligibility is achieved  if shorter non substantive vesting period approach 
see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on a number of factors  including both positive and negative evidence  in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
those factors include historical taxable income or loss  projected future taxable income or loss  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
in circumstances where the company or any of its affiliates has incurred three years of cumulative losses which constitute significant negative evidence  positive evidence of equal or greater significance is needed by the company at a minimum to overcome that negative evidence before a tax benefit is recognized for deductible temporary differences and loss carryforwards 
in evaluating the positive evidence available  expectations as to future taxable income would rarely be sufficient to overcome the negative evidence of recent cumulative losses  even if 
table of contents supported by detailed forecasts and projections 
in order to reverse the recorded valuation allowance  the company would likely need to have positive cumulative earnings for the three year period preceding the year of the reversal 
therefore  the company s projections as to future earnings would not be used as an indicator in analyzing whether a valuation allowance established in a prior year can be removed or reduced 
at june  and june   the company s deferred tax assets related to tax carryforwards were million and million  respectively 
the tax carryforwards are comprised of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax credit carryovers 
a majority of the net operating losses and other tax credits can be carried forward for years 
the company has recorded valuation allowances for the majority of its federal deferred tax assets and loss carryforwards  and for tax loss carryforwards of certain non us subsidiaries 
the company believes that the deferred tax assets for the remaining tax carryforwards are considered more likely than not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin fin was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
the company plans to adopt fin for annual periods beginning june  the company is currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of fin will have on its consolidated financial statements and at this time no material adjustments are anticipated

may have on the financial statements 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
regarding the quantification of financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires a dual approach for quantifications of errors using both a method that focuses on the income statement impact  including the cumulative effect of prior years misstatements  and a method that focuses on the period end balance sheet 
sab no 
will be effective for the company beginning in fiscal the company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

 entities may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election  called the fair value option  will enable entities to achieve an offset accounting effect for changes in fair value of certain related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management and market sensitive financial instruments certain operations  assets  and liabilities of the company are denominated in foreign currencies subjecting the company to foreign currency exchange risk 
in addition  some of the company s debt financing varies with market rates exposing the company to the market risk from changes in interest rates 
in order to provide the user of these financial statements guidance regarding the magnitude of these risks  the securities and exchange commission requires the company to provide certain quantitative disclosures based upon hypothetical assumptions 
specifically  these disclosures require the calculation of the effect of a increase in market interest rates and a uniform strengthening of the us dollar against foreign currencies on the reported net earnings and financial position of the company 
the company s multi currency revolving credit agreement s interest rate varies based on market interest rates 
had interest rates increased  additional interest expense  tax effected  would have decreased the net income by an estimated million in fiscal  and increased the net loss by an estimated million in fiscal the company s foreign denominated assets and liabilities are cash  accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and intercompany receivables and payables  primarily in member countries of the european union  asia pacific and  to a lesser extent  canada and latin america 
tools that the company may use to manage foreign exchange exposures include currency clauses in sales contracts  local debt to offset asset exposures and forward contracts to hedge significant transactions 
the company has not entered into any forward contracts in fiscal or had the us dollar strengthened against various foreign currencies  net sales would have been lower by an estimated million for fiscal and an estimated million for fiscal total assets would have declined by an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june  and an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june   while the total liabilities would have decreased by an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june  and an estimated million as of the fiscal year ended june  the interpretation and analysis of these disclosures should not be considered in isolation since such variances in interest rates and exchange rates would likely influence other economic factors 
such factors  which are not readily quantifiable  would likely also affect the company s operations
