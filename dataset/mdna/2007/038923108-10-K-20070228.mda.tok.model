item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with the sections of this report entitled risk factors  forward looking statements  and selected consolidated financial information of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries and the historical consolidated financial statements of arbor realty trust  inc and subsidiaries  including related notes  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a maryland corporation that was formed in june to invest in real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans  including junior participating interests in first mortgages  preferred and direct equity and  in limited cases  discounted mortgage notes and other real estate related assets  which we refer to collectively as structured finance investments 
we also invest in mortgage related securities 
we conduct substantially all of our operations through our operating partnership and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
our operating performance is primarily driven by the following factors net interest income earned on our investments net interest income represents the amount by which the interest income earned on our assets exceeds the interest expense incurred on our borrowings 
if the yield earned on our assets increases or the cost of borrowings decreases  this will have a positive impact on earnings 
net interest income is also directly impacted by the size of our asset portfolio credit quality of our assets effective asset and portfolio management is essential to maximizing the performance and value of a real estate mortgage investment 
maintaining the credit quality of our loans and investments is of critical importance 
loans that do not perform in accordance with their terms may have a negative impact on earnings 
cost control we seek to minimize our operating costs  which consist primarily of employee compensation and related costs  management fees and other general and administrative expenses 
as the size of the portfolio increases  certain of these expenses  particularly employee compensation expenses  may increase 
we are organized and conduct our operations to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or a reit and to comply with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code with respect thereto 
a reit is generally not subject to federal income tax on that portion of its reit taxable income which is distributed to its stockholders provided that at least of its reit taxable income is distributed and provided that certain other requirements are met 
certain of our assets that produce non qualifying income may be held in taxable reit subsidiaries 
unlike other subsidiaries of a reit  the income of a taxable reit subsidiary is subject to federal and state income taxes 
the provision for income taxes related to these taxable subsidiaries has not been material as they have had minimal activity

sources of operating revenues we derive our operating revenues primarily through interest received from making real estate related bridge and mezzanine loans and preferred equity investments 
interest income earned on these loans and investments represented approximately  and of our total revenues in   and  respectively 
interest income is also derived from profits of equity participation interests 
in  and interest income from participation interests represented approximately million  million and million  or  and of total revenues  respectively 
we also derive interest income from our investments in mortgage related securities 
in  and  interest on these investments represented approximately less than  and of our total revenues  respectively 
in addition  we derived operating revenue from income from swap derivative which represented income from interest rate swaps on junior subordinated notes relating to trust preferred securities 
in  income from swap derivative represented less than of our total revenues 
there was no such revenue in and additionally  we derive operating revenues from other income that represents loan structuring and miscellaneous asset management fees associated with our loans and investments portfolio 
revenue from other income represented less than of our total revenues in  and income from equity affiliates and gain on sale of loans and real estate we derive income from equity affiliates relating to joint ventures that were formed with equity partners to acquire  develop and or sell real estate assets 
these joint ventures are not majority owned or controlled by us  and are not consolidated in our financial statements 
these investments are recorded under the equity method of accounting 
we record our share of the net income and losses from the underlying properties on a single line item in the consolidated income statements as income from equity affiliates 
in  and  income from equity affiliates totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we also may derive income from the gain on sale of loans and real estate 
we may acquire real estate for our own investment and  upon stabilization  dispose at an anticipated return and real estate notes generally at a discount from lenders in situations where the borrower wishes to restructure and reposition its short term debt and the lender wishes to divest certain assets from its portfolio 
no such income has been recorded to date 
significant accounting estimates and critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is presented in note to our consolidated financial statements  which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
certain of the accounting policies used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are particularly important for an understanding of the financial position and results of operations presented in the historical consolidated financial statements included in this report and require the application of significant judgment by management and  as a result  are subject to a degree of uncertainty 

table of contents loans and investments statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires that at the time of purchase  we designate a security as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading depending on ability and intent 
securities held for sale are reported at fair value  while securities and investments held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
we do not have any trading securities at this time 
loans held for investment are intended to be held to maturity and  accordingly  are carried at cost  net of unamortized loan origination costs and fees  unless such loan or investment is deemed to be impaired 
we invest in preferred equity interests that allow us to participate in a percentage of the underlying property s cash flows from operations and proceeds from a sale or refinancing 
at the inception of each such investment  management must determine whether such investment should be accounted for as a loan  joint venture or as real estate 
to date  management has determined that all such investments are properly accounted for and reported as loans 
specific valuation allowances are established for impaired loans based on the fair value of collateral on an individual loan basis 
the fair value of the collateral is determined by an evaluation of operating cash flow from the property during the projected holding period  and estimated sales value computed by applying an expected capitalization rate to the stabilized net operating income of the specific property  less selling costs  discounted at market discount rates 
if upon completion of the valuation  the fair value of the underlying collateral securing the impaired loan is less than the net carrying value of the loan  an allowance is created with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
an allowance for each loan would be maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb probable losses 
as of december   and  no impairment has been identified and no valuation allowances have been established 
at december  we had an million loan in our portfolio that is non performing and income recognition has been suspended 
the principal amount of the loan is not deemed to be impaired and no loan loss reserve has been recorded at this time 
income recognition will resume when the loan becomes contractually current and performance has recommenced 
repurchase obligations in certain circumstances  we have financed the purchase of investments from a counterparty through a repurchase agreement with that same counterparty 
we currently record these investments in the same manner as other investments financed with repurchase agreements  with the investment recorded as an asset and the related borrowing under any repurchase agreement as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
interest income earned on the investments and interest expense incurred on the repurchase obligations are reported separately on the consolidated income statement 
there is discussion  based upon a technical interpretation of sfas  that these transactions may not qualify as a purchase by us 
we believe  and it is industry practice  that we are accounting for these transactions in an appropriate manner  however  if these investments do not qualify as a purchase under sfas  we would be required to present the net investment on our balance sheet as a derivative with the corresponding change in fair value of the derivative being recorded in the income statement 
the value of the derivative would reflect not only changes in the value of the underlying investment  but also changes in the value of the underlying credit provided by the counterparty 
as of december  we had entered into four such transactions  with a book value of the associated assets of million financed with repurchase obligations of million 
as of december  we had entered into eight such transactions  with a book value of the associated assets of million financed with repurchase obligations of million 
adoption of the aforementioned treatment would result in these assets and liabilities being recorded net on our balance sheets 
available for sale securities we invest in agency sponsored whole pool mortgage related securities 
pools of federal national mortgage association  or fnma  and federal home loan mortgage corporation  or fhlmc  adjustable rate residential mortgage loans underlie these mortgage related securities 
we receive payments from the payments that are made on these underlying mortgage loans  which have a fixed rate of interest for three years and adjust annually thereafter 
these securities are carried at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and 
table of contents reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
unrealized losses other than temporary losses are recognized currently in income 
capitalized interest the company capitalizes interest in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs in financial statements that include investments accounted for by the equity method 
this statement amended sfas no 
capitalization of interest costs to include investments equity  loans and advances accounted for by the equity method as qualifying assets of the investor while the investee has activities in progress necessary to commence its planned principal operations  provided that the investee s activities include the use of funds to acquire qualifying assets for its operations 
an investee  in one of the company s joint ventures accounted for using the equity method  is in the process of using funds to acquire qualifying assets for its planned principal operations 
during the years ended december  and the company capitalized million and million  respectively of interest relating to this investment 
there was no capitalization of interest during the year ended december  revenue recognition interest income 
interest income is recognized on the accrual basis as it is earned from loans  investments and available for sale securities 
in many instances  the borrower pays an additional amount of interest at the time the loan is closed  an origination fee  and deferred interest upon maturity 
in some cases interest income may also include the amortization or accretion of premiums and discounts arising at the purchase or origination 
this additional income  net of any direct loan origination costs incurred  is deferred and accreted into interest income on an effective yield or interest method adjusted for actual prepayment activity over the life of the related loan or available for sale security as a yield adjustment 
income recognition is suspended for loans when in the opinion of management a full recovery of income and principal becomes doubtful 
income recognition is resumed when the loan becomes contractually current and performance is demonstrated to be resumed 
several of the loans provide for accrual of interest at specified rates  which differ from current payment terms 
interest is recognized on such loans at the accrual rate subject to management s determination that accrued interest and outstanding principal are ultimately collectible  based on the underlying collateral and operations of the borrower 
if management cannot make this determination regarding collectibility  interest income above the current pay rate is recognized only upon actual receipt 
additionally  interest income is recorded when earned from equity participation interests  referred to as equity kickers 
these equity kickers have the potential to generate additional revenues to us as a result of excess cash flows being distributed and or as appreciated properties are sold or refinanced 
variable interest entities in december  the fasb issued interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r as a revision to fin no 
 which requires a variable interest entity vie to be consolidated by its primary beneficiary pb 
the pb is the party that absorbs a majority of the vie s anticipated losses and or a majority of the expected returns 
we have evaluated our loans and investments and investments in equity affiliates to determine whether they are vie s 
this evaluation resulted in us determining that our mezzanine loans  preferred equity investments and investments in equity affiliates were potential variable interests 
for each of these investments  we have evaluated the sufficiency of the fair value of the entities equity investments at risk to absorb losses  that as a group the holders of the equity investments at risk have a the direct or indirect ability through voting rights to make decisions about the entities significant activities  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity and their obligations are not protected directly or indirectly  c the right to receive the expected residual return of the entity and their rights are not capped  the voting rights of some of these investors are proportional to their obligations to absorb the expected losses of the entity  their rights to receive the expected returns of the equity  or both  and that substantially all of the entities activities do not involve or are not conducted on behalf of an investor that has disproportionately few voting rights 
as of december   we have identified loans and investments which were made to entities determined to be vie s 
a summary of our identified vie s is presented in note of our consolidated financial statements  which appear in financial statements and supplementary data 
however  for 
table of contents the vie s identified  we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiaries and as such the vie s should not be consolidated in our financial statements 
for all other investments  we have determined they are not vie s 
as such  we have continued to account for these loans and investments as a loan or joint venture  as appropriate 
derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with financial accounting statement fas  the carrying values of interest rate swaps and the underlying hedged liabilities are reflected at their fair value 
we rely on quotations from a third party to determine these fair values 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are either offset against the change in the fair value of the hedged liability through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
because the valuations of our hedging activities are based on estimates  the fair value may change if our estimates are inaccurate 
for the effect of hypothetical changes in market interest rates on our interest rate swaps  see the market risk section 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas

sfas also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas and sfas sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring after january  we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fin r  determining the variability to be considered in applying fasb interpretation no 
r  that became effective beginning third quarter of fsp fin no 
r clarifies that the variability to be considered in applying interpretation r shall be based on an analysis of the design of the variable interest entity 
we believe that our current method of accounting for variable interest entities is consistent with fin r in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement in the financial statements of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance as to its application and related transition  and is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect adoption to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements

the warehouse credit agreement  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay interest monthly  based on pricing over libor 
the amount of our pricing over libor varies depending upon the structure of the loan or investment financed pursuant to the specific agreement 
the warehouse credit agreement  bridge loan warehousing credit agreement  and the master repurchase agreements require that we pay down borrowings under these facilities pro rata as principal payments on our loans and investments are received 
in addition  if upon maturity of a loan or investment we decide to grant the borrower an extension option  the financial institutions have the option to extend the borrowings or request payment in full on the outstanding borrowings of the loan or investment extended 
the financial institutions also have the right to request immediate payment of any outstanding borrowings on any loan or investment that is at least days delinquent 
as of december   these facilities had an aggregate capacity of billion and borrowings were approximately billion 
each of the credit facilities contains various financials covenants and restrictions  including minimum net worth and debt to equity ratios 
in addition to the financial terms and capacities described above  our credit facilities generally contain covenants that prohibit us from effecting a change in control  disposing of or encumbering assets being financed and restrict us from making any material amendment to our underwriting guidelines without approval of the lender 
if we violate these covenants in any of our credit facilities  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on attractive terms  if at all 
violations of these covenants may result in our being unable to borrow unused amounts under our credit facilities  even if repayment of some or all borrowings is not required 
as of december   we are in compliance with all covenants and restrictions under these credit facilities 
we have three junior loan participations with a total outstanding balance at december  of million 
these participation borrowings have maturity dates equal to the corresponding mortgage loans and are secured by the participant s interests in the mortgage loans 
interest expense is based on a portion of the interest received from the loans 
we believe our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our short term liquidity within one year and long term liquidity needs 
our short term and long term liquidity needs include ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund future investments  fund operating costs and fund distributions to our stockholders 
our loans and investments are financed under existing credit facilities and their credit status is continuously monitored  therefore  these loans and investments are expected to generate a generally stable return 
our ability to meet our long term liquidity and capital resource requirements is subject to obtaining additional debt and equity financing 
if we are unable to renew our sources of financing on substantially similar terms or at all  it would have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
any decision by our lenders and investors to enter into such transactions with us will depend upon a number of factors  such as our financial performance  compliance with the terms of our existing credit arrangements  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders and investors resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make such capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 

table of contents to maintain our status as a reit under the internal revenue code  we must distribute annually at least of our taxable income 
these distribution requirements limit our ability to retain earnings and thereby replenish or increase capital for operations 
however  we believe that our significant capital resources and access to financing will provide us with financial flexibility and market responsiveness at levels sufficient to meet current and anticipated capital requirements  including expected new lending and investment opportunities 
in order to maximize the return on our funds  cash generated from operations is generally used to temporarily pay down borrowings under credit facilities whose primary purpose is to fund our new loans and investments 
when making distributions  we borrow the required funds by drawing on credit capacity available under our credit facilities 
to date  all distributions have been funded in this manner 
all funds borrowed to make distributions have been repaid by funds generated from operations 
share repurchase plan in august  the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan that enabled us to buy up to one million shares of our common stock

table of contents the base management fee is not calculated based on the manager s performance or the types of assets its selects for investment on our behalf  but it is affected by the performance of these assets because it is based on the value of our operating partnership s equity 
we incurred million and million in base management fees for services rendered in and  respectively 
incentive compensation

in  our manager earned a total of million of incentive compensation and elected to receive it partially in cash totaling million and partially in  shares of common stock 
we pay the annual incentive compensation in four installments  each within days of the end of each fiscal quarter 
the calculation of each installment is based on results for the months ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter for which the installment is payable 
these installments of the annual incentive compensation are subject to recalculation and potential reconciliation at the end of such fiscal year 
subject to the ownership limitations in our charter  at least of this incentive compensation is payable to our manager in shares of our common stock having a value equal to the average closing price per share for the last days of the fiscal quarter for which the incentive compensation is being paid 
the incentive compensation is accrued as it is earned 
in accordance with issue b of eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  the expense incurred for incentive compensation paid in common stock is determined using the valuation method described above and the quoted market price of our common stock on the last day of each quarter 
at december of each year  we remeasure the incentive compensation paid to our manager in the form of common stock in accordance with issue a of eitf which discusses how to measure at the measurement date when certain terms are not known prior to the measurement date 
accordingly  the expense recorded for such common stock is adjusted to reflect the fair value of the common stock on the measurement date when the final calculation of the annual incentive compensation is determined 
in the event that the annual incentive compensation calculated as of the measurement date is less than the four quarterly installments of the annual incentive compensation paid in advance  our manager will refund the amount of such overpayment in cash and we would record a negative incentive compensation expense in the quarter when such overpayment is determined

if  without cause  we terminate or elect not to renew the management agreement for any other reason  including a change of control of us  we are required to pay a 
table of contents termination fee equal to two times the base management fee and incentive compensation paid for the month period preceding the termination 
inflation in our two most recent fiscal years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our net income and revenue 
changes in the general level of interest rates prevailing in the economy in response to changes in the rate of inflation generally have little effect on our income because the majority of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have floating rates of interest 
additionally  we also have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
in connection with these loans  we have entered into various interest swaps to hedge our exposure to the interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to certain fixed rate loans in our portfolio 
however  the value of our interest earning assets  our ability to realize gains from the sale of assets  and the average life of our interest earning assets  among other things  may be effected

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and real estate values 
the primary market risks that we are exposed to are real estate risk  interest rate risk  market value risk and prepayment risk 
real estate risk commercial mortgage assets may be viewed as exposing an investor to greater risk of loss than residential mortgage assets since such assets are typically secured by larger loans to fewer obligors than residential mortgage assets 
multi family and commercial property values and net operating income derived from such properties are subject to volatility and may be affected adversely by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  national  regional and local economic conditions which may be adversely affected by industry slowdowns and other factors  local real estate conditions such as an oversupply of housing  retail  industrial  office or other commercial space  changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments  construction quality  construction cost  age and design  demographic factors  retroactive changes to building or similar codes  and increases in operating expenses such as energy costs 
in the event net operating income decreases  a borrower may have difficulty repaying our loans  which could result in losses to us 
in addition  decreases in property values reduce the value of the collateral and the potential proceeds available to a borrower to repay our loans  which could also cause us to suffer losses 
even when the net operating income is sufficient to cover the related property s debt service  there can be no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the future 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
our operating results will depend in large part on differences between the income from our loans and our borrowing costs 
most of our loans and borrowings are variable rate instruments  based on libor 
the objective of this strategy is to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income 
in addition  we have various fixed rate loans in our portfolio  which are financed with variable rate libor borrowings 
we have entered into various interest swaps as discussed below to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on our variable rate libor borrowings as it relates to our fixed rate loans 
many of our loans and borrowings are subject to various interest rate floors 
as a result  the impact of a change in interest rates may be different on our interest income than it is on our interest expense 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a increase 
based on the loans and liabilities as of december   and assuming the balances of these loans and liabilities remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a decrease in libor would decrease our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
this is primarily due to our interest rate swaps that effectively convert a portion of the variable rate libor based debt  as it relates to certain fixed rate assets  to a fixed basis that is not subject to a decrease  partially offset by loans currently subject to interest rate floors and  therefore  not be subject to the full downward interest rate adjustment 
as of december   a increase in libor would have increased our annual net income and cash flows in the subsequent twelve months by approximately million

table of contents in the event of a significant rising interest rate environment and or economic downturn  defaults could increase and result in credit losses to us  which could adversely affect our liquidity and operating results 
further  such delinquencies or defaults could have an adverse effect on the spreads between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we invest in securities  which are designated as available for sale 
these securities are adjustable rate securities that have a fixed component for three years and  thereafter  generally reset annually 
these securities are financed with a repurchase agreement that bears interest at a rate of one month libor plus 
since the repricing of the debt obligations occurs more quickly than the repricing of the securities  on average  our cost of borrowings will rise more quickly in response to an increase in market interest rates than the earnings rate on the securities 
this will result in a reduction to our net interest income and cash flows related to these securities 
based on the securities and borrowings as of december   and assuming the balances of these securities and borrowings remain unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would reduce our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
a decrease in libor would increase our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
as of december   assuming the balances of these securities and borrowings remained unchanged for the subsequent twelve months  a increase in libor would have reduced our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
a decrease in libor would have increased our annual net income and cash flows by approximately million 
in connection with our cdos described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge the exposure to the risk of changes in the difference between three month libor and one month libor interest rates 
these interest rate swaps became necessary due to the investor s return being paid based on a three month libor index while the assets contributed to the cdos are yielding interest based on a one month libor index 
as of december  we had ten of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have a combined notional value of billion 
as of december  we had five of these interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a combined notional value of million 
the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   and december   if there were a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
in connection with the issuance of variable rate junior subordinate notes during and  we entered into various interest rate swap agreements 
these swaps have total notional values of million and million  respectively  as of december  and december  the market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december  and december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had eighteen interest rate swap agreements outstanding that have a combined notional value of million 
as of december  we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding with combined notional values of million to hedge current and outstanding libor based debt relating to certain fixed rate loans within our portfolio 
the fair market value of these interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   and december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have increased by approximately million and million respectively 
if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of these interest rate swaps would have decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
our hedging transactions using derivative instruments also involve certain additional risks such as counterparty credit risk  the enforceability of hedging contracts and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates will cause a significant loss of basis in the contract 
the counterparties to our derivative arrangements 
table of contents are major financial institutions with high credit ratings with which we and our affiliates may also have other financial relationships 
as a result  we do not anticipate that any of these counterparties will fail to meet their obligations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related amounts incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies 
we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
market value risk our available for sale securities are reflected at their estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the estimated fair value of these securities fluctuate primarily due to changes in interest rates and other factors  however  given that these securities are guaranteed as to principal and or interest by an agency of the us government  such fluctuations are generally not based on the creditworthiness of the mortgages securing these securities 
generally  in a rising interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to decrease  conversely  in a decreasing interest rate environment  the estimated fair value of these securities would be expected to increase 
prepayment risk as we receive repayments of principal on these securities  premiums paid on such securities are amortized against interest income using the effective yield method through the expected maturity dates of the securities 
in general  an increase in prepayment rates will accelerate the amortization of purchase premiums  thereby reducing the interest income earned on the securities
