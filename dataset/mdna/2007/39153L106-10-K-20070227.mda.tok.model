we offer technologically advanced  highly reliable and long lasting products for imds and enable our customers to introduce imds that are progressively smaller  longer lasting  more efficient and more functional 
additionally  in  we expanded our business into value added assembly of products that incorporate these components 
with this in mind  we designed and built a state of the art manufacturing facility in tijuana mexico  incorporating two class  clean rooms  one class  clean room   square feet of manufacturing space  engineering  metrology and quality laboratories 
this facility is led by a management team with diverse medical device and contract manufacturing backgrounds 
we also leverage our core competencies in technology and manufacturing through our electrochem commercial power ecp segment to develop and produce cells and battery packs for commercial applications that demand high performance and reliability  including oil and gas exploration  pipeline inspection  telematics  oceanographic equipment  seismic  communication  military and aerospace applications 
most of the imc products that we sell are utilized by customers in cardiac rhythm management crm devices 
the crm market comprises devices utilizing high rate batteries and capacitors such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators icds and cardiac resynchronization therapy with backup defibrillation devices crt d and devices utilizing low or medium rate batteries but no capacitors pacemakers and crts 
all crm devices utilize other components such as enclosures and feedthroughs  and certain crm devices utilize electromagnetic interference emi filtering technology 
our customers our products are designed to provide reliable  long lasting solutions that meet the evolving requirements and needs of our customers and the end users of their products 
our medical customers include leading imd manufacturers such as biotronik  boston scientific  medtronic  the sorin group and st 
jude medical 
a substantial part of our business is conducted with a limited number of customers 
in  boston scientific  medtronic and st 
jude medical collectively accounted for approximately of our total sales  compared to in and the nature and extent of our selling relationships with each crm customer are different in terms of breadth of component products purchased  purchased product volumes  length of contractual commitment  ordering patterns  inventory management and selling prices 
we entered into an agreement with boston scientific in february pursuant to which boston scientific will purchase a minimum quantity of filtered feedthroughs at prices specified in the agreement 
the period of the agreement is february  to december  our previously disclosed agreements with boston scientific pursuant to which boston scientific purchased wet tantalum capacitors and batteries have expired 
we are negotiating a follow on agreement with targeted completion during the first quarter of purchases and shipments of wet tantalum capacitors and batteries continue during contract negotiations 
our ecp customers are primarily companies involved in oil and gas exploration  pipeline inspection  telematics  oceanographic equipment  seismic  communication  military and aerospace applications 
we have entered into long term supply agreements with some of our customers 
for each of our products  we recognize revenue when the products are shipped and title passes 
our ceo s view was another successful year for our company 
we experienced double digit sales growth and achieved all of our financial goals despite a down year in the icd medical market and while realigning our management  business unit and manufacturing operations 
all of this was accomplished by maintaining our focus on producing the highest quality and most reliable products on the market 
additionally  we progressed our customer commitment and technological innovation to a new level 
by continuing to implement our strategic plan  which includes both efficiency improvements and organic growth  in we drove sales growth and positioned ourselves for even more success ahead 
in  overall sales were up and net income increased from the prior year 
specifically  our imc sales were up  primarily due to strong sales of new assembly products and continued growth in feedthrough  coated electrodes and molded components 
in the commercial market  our ecp sales increased by from the prior year 
several factors contributed to this growth including investment in sales and marketing  expansion into new emerging markets such as telematics  and investment in engineering 
during we also facilitated a transition in our management team  which included my appointment to chief executive officer 
in each of their respective roles  our management team has been finding new ways to proactively invest in competitive advantages for our customers 
we are making significant advances in technological progress and service to our customers  and continually re proving our distinctive value proposition 
the diversity  flexibility and experience of our management team will be leveraged as the company continues to grow 
in  we exploited our technical development expertise to deliver new  innovative products into the market 
for example  we believe our new q battery series is the most powerful and versatile high rate implantable battery portfolio to hit the cardiac rhythm management crm market in many years and for many years ahead 
i am pleased to report that we have already begun manufacturing our q battery series to customer specifications 
the ecp business unit significantly ramped up the manufacture of specialized cells and battery packs to meet customer demand in the performance  long life and high reliability of electrochem products make them ideally suited for extreme applications 
we expect to continue to optimize and expand our ecp business 
a long term facility expansion program is currently underway  which should enable us to continue delivering the outstanding products and service that our customers have come to expect from electrochem 
over the past year  we also continued to build our presence in emerging markets  including components of neuromodulation devices that deliver a wide range of neurostimulation and drug delivery therapies  mri safe solutions that may revolutionize patient screening options  and to enable value added features and functionalities 
in operations  we ve made substantial progress in our second of three years of integration and realignment activity that we believe will ultimately permit us to realize our expected annual savings of million per year 
we intend to invest these savings in additional r d staff and proprietary technologies  and to pursue and integrate new  complementary businesses and markets 
we launched the move of our manufacturing operations from our columbia  maryland facility to our new state of the art facility in tijuana  mexico 
the final closure of our carson city  nevada facility was delayed to accommodate a pending customer regulatory approval 
in the meantime  our tijuana  mexico medical development and manufacturing facility has attained iso certification  the internationally recognized quality standard 
both the alden and tijuana facilities are designed specifically to offer our customers world class medical device manufacturing and assembly  and thus moving us further up our customers supply chain 
at the close of  we retained an independent firm to conduct a corporate customer satisfaction survey and heard from of our accounts 
greatbatch product quality  performance  and reliability were rated very high 
because of the critical nature of customer product applications  we are pleased to know that our contributions are so strong 
the value of our technology enabling designs and custom engineering capabilities were also rated very high 
we remain fully dedicated to ongoing partnerships that produce custom device solutions  from individual components to tailored assembly and sub assembly 
this survey also noted areas for improvement in our customer service 
while our first priority is always to maintain product excellence  we do need to make it easier for customers to do business with us 
we already have begun to take action to simplify points of contact  streamline our quotation process  and identify ways to speed design and development without sacrificing quality 
our goal is to deliver the highest quality  most reliable products in the market  in an efficient  customer focused manner 
with the majority of surveyed customers indicating they are satisfied with us  we believe we are well on our way to achieving nearly customer satisfaction 
as i look ahead to  our major focus will continue to be directed to the following objectives completion of the plant consolidation initiatives at carson city and columbia and to exit with a cumulative annual savings run rate of million  execute our ecp plant expansion plan  streamline  optimize and expand current product offerings  operations and business processes  introduce next generation implantable batteries  capacitors and coatings  expand our rechargeable battery portfolio in both medical and commercial markets  further penetrate the neurostimulation market  develop components that enable patients to receive mri scans without complications  and maintain an active business development pipeline and evaluate and pursue compelling new business opportunities 
we have an ambitious strategic agenda for i believe the leadership team is in place that will enable the company to achieve these objectives 
cost savings and consolidation efforts during and  we recorded charges in other operating expenses related to our ongoing cost savings and consolidation efforts 
additional information is set forth at note other operating expenses of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained at item of this report 
severance 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a plan for consolidating our corporate and business unit organization structure 
as a result  severance charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of expense of million was recorded in our imc segment  million in the ecp segment and million was recorded in unallocated operating expenses 
accrued severance related to this consolidation plan was million as of december  during the first quarter of  we implemented a workforce reduction as a continuation of cost containment efforts initiated mid year as a result  severance charges of million were recorded and paid in expense of million was recorded in our imc segment  million in our ecp segment and million was recorded in unallocated operating expenses 
alden facility consolidation 
beginning in the first quarter of and ending in the second quarter of we consolidated our medical capacitor manufacturing operations in cheektowaga  ny  and our implantable medical battery manufacturing operations in clarence  ny  into our advanced power source manufacturing facility in alden  ny alden facility 
we also consolidated the capacitor research  development and engineering operations from our cheektowaga  ny facility into our technology center in clarence  ny 
the total expense for these consolidation efforts was million  which was below our original estimate of million to million 
the expenses for the alden facility consolidation are included in the imc business segment 
of these  million were paid in cash and million were for assets written off 
carson city facility shutdown and tijuana facility consolidation no 
on march   we announced our intent to close our carson city  nv facility carson city facility and consolidate the work performed at that facility into our tijuana  mexico facility tijuana facility consolidation no 

we have delayed the anticipated final closing of the carson city facility until the second quarter of in order to accommodate a customer s pending regulatory approval 
if this regulatory approval is delayed further  additional costs could be incurred 
the total revised estimate for this plan is anticipated to be between million and million  of which million has been incurred through december  all categories of costs are considered to be cash expenditures  except for million of accelerated depreciation 
once the moves are completed  we anticipate annual cost savings in the range of million to million 
the expenses for our carson city facility shutdown and the tijuana facility consolidation no 
are included in our imc business segment 
columbia facility arl shutdown  tijuana facility consolidation no 
 and rd e consolidation 
on november   we announced our intent to close both our columbia  md facility columbia facility and our fremont  ca advanced research laboratory arl 
the manufacturing operations at our columbia facility will be moved into our tijuana facility tijuana facility consolidation no 

the research  development and engineering rd e and product development functions at the columbia facility and at arl will be relocated to our technology center in clarence  ny 
the total estimated cost for this facility consolidation plan is anticipated to be between million and million of which million has been incurred through december  the arl move and closure portion of this consolidation project is complete 
we expect to incur and pay the remaining costs of the consolidation project over the next two fiscal quarters through june all categories of costs are considered to be cash expenditures  except for million of accelerated depreciation and asset write offs 
once the moves are completed  the company anticipates annual cost savings in the range of million to million 
the expenses for the columbia facility and arl shutdowns  the tijuana facility consolidation no 
and the rd e consolidation are included in the imc business segment 
our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if o it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and o changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our most critical accounting estimates are described below 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policies for revenue recognition  however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates  because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective

fair values for goodwill estimates of revenue streams  royalty subject to estimation risks related are determined based primarily on discounted rates and other future benefits accruing to the purchase price allocation cash flows  however where appropriate  market to us 
significant changes in these conducted at acquisition 
multiples or appraised values are also used 
estimates could create future impairments indefinite lived intangible assets such as of these indefinite lived intangible trademarks and tradenames are evaluated for assets 
impairment by using the income approach 
this method is used to estimate the value of intangibles by considering the present worth of the stream of future benefits accruing to the owner of these assets 
these future benefits are quantified by assuming a relief from royalty 
the concept underlying this method is that the user realizes an enhanced earnings capacity from ownership of the intangible asset equal to the royalty they would have to pay a third party for use of the name

fiscal compared with fiscal sales we achieved sales growth of in compared to this growth was accomplished during a period in which the underlying crm market  which represents over of our total sales  was in decline 
this growth is even more favorable considering that results include the favorable benefit of approximately million to million in icd marketplace field actions 
another sales highlight for was our ecp business  which grew through a combination of increased market penetration  new product introductions and greater value added pack assembly 
imc 
the nature and extent of our selling relationship with each crm customer is different in terms of component products purchased  selling prices  product volumes  ordering patterns and inventory management 
we have pricing arrangements with our customers that at times do not specify minimum order quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time 
our customers may have inventory management programs and alternate supply arrangements of which we are unaware 
additionally  the relative market share among the crm device manufacturers changes periodically 
consequently  these and other factors can significantly impact our sales in any given period 
we achieved year over year growth of from our medical business 
this growth was accomplished despite the underlying crm market being down compared to the prior year and an approximate reduction in selling prices 
assembly products  feedthroughs  coated electrodes and machined components were the primary growth drivers 
the assembly business was a new opportunity that was launched in the second half of growth in feedthroughs  coated products and machined components represents market share penetration with both our domestic and international customers 
we believe these products will continue to represent a near term growth opportunity for the company as we continue to penetrate the market and bring new technology to our customers 
our icd battery product line declined by during  commensurate with the market and the market share shifts amongst our customers 
the decline in sales was primarily due to lower volume with us based customers and the approximate reduction in selling prices  partially offset by strong european customer sales 
this growth represents increased adoption of our high rate battery technology 
we expect pricing pressure from our larger customers to continue in the future 
the capacitor business also experienced a decline in sales 
capacitor sales declined by million or  primarily attributable to the actions taken by a single customer in late to further vertically integrate its operations 
we believe the impact on our financial results of this customer s actions stabilized in the capacitor product line represents a significant growth opportunity and we continue to invest in advancing our technology to best position our product in the marketplace 
ecp 
similar to imc customers  we have pricing arrangements with our customers that many times do not specify minimum quantities 
our visibility to customer ordering patterns is over a relatively short period of time 
ecp sales grew by in through a combination of increased market penetration  new product introductions and greater value added pack assembly 
the oil and gas exploration market remains robust due to the increased demand for products used in pipeline inspections  pressure monitoring and measurement while drilling applications 
in addition  our presence in the emerging telematics market has provided incremental sales opportunities 
sales outlook we expect both imc and ecp sales to increase by approximately next year  resulting in a full year sales range of million to million 
we have assumed an underlying medical market growth rate of for next year 
the forecasted increase of or nearly twice the growth of the underlying market reflects our confidence that we will continue to increase our market share with our existing customer base and penetrate new customer opportunities 
cost of sales changes from the prior year to cost of sales as a percentage of sales were primarily due to the following year ended december  production efficiencies primarily associated with higher volumes a excess capacity at wet tantalum capacitor facility b excess capacity at tijuana  mexico facility c mix change d other total percentage point change to cost of sales as a percentage of sales a 
this decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the fact that as production volumes increase  fixed costs such as plant overhead and depreciation do not increase at the same rate 
the production volume increase was necessary to accommodate the increased sales and to replenish safety stocks 
b 
during  the capacitor facility was not being utilized to its full capacity 
the cost associated with the excess capacity was eliminated in as capacitor manufacturing was consolidated into the alden facility 
in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  excess capacity costs were expensed in c 
the tijuana  mexico facility was new in and its infrastructure and floor space were coming on line during and therefore the full cost of the capacity was not in place 
in  the tijuana facility was on line for the entire year and excess capacity costs in exceeded those in in accordance with our inventory accounting policy  excess capacity costs were expensed 
d 
the revenue increase from was primarily in other imc sales  which generally have lower margins 
we expect cost of sales as a percentage of sales to decrease over the next several years 
this is a result of our consolidation efforts and the elimination of excess capacity  partially offset by a continuing shift in product mix towards lower margin products 
excess capacity for the tijuana facility is not expected to be eliminated until mid when the last announced consolidation effort is anticipated to be completed see the cost savings and consolidation efforts section of this item for additional information

these expenses are primarily related to the initial start up of the value added assembly business 
c during  the company recorded a loss of million related to the write off of a battery test system that was under development 
upon completion of the company s engineering and technical evaluation  it was determined that the system could not meet the required specifications in a cost effective manner 
this charge was included in the imc business segment 
the remaining expense for includes million of various asset dispositions and million for professional fees related to a potential acquisition that was no longer considered probable 
during  a million charge was recorded for the write down of automated cathode assembly equipment for the imc segment 
the remaining expense for relates to various asset dispositions of approximately million and the cost to exit a development agreement of million 
prior year amounts have been conformed to the current year presentation 
in plant relocation and asset disposition expenses are expected to be approximately million to million 
interest expense and interest income interest expense was consistent with  and is primarily related to the contingent convertible notes 
interest income increased during in comparison to due to higher interest rates on higher cash and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is lower than the us statutory rate due to the allowable extraterritorial income exclusion eti  the qualified production activities deduction and the federal research and development credit 
in the net eti benefits had a greater impact on the effective tax rate than in as a result  our effective tax rate was reduced to in compared to in we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately to in fiscal compared with fiscal sales imc 
the results include the benefit of market place customer field actions surrounding icd products 
we estimate that the favorable benefit of marketplace field actions was approximately million to million in moving beyond the field actions  the increase in demand was not isolated to any one customer 
we saw strength across all of our products and our entire customer base 
the increase in imc sales of for was primarily due to increased demand for icd batteries  filtered feedthroughs  coated components and medical enclosures offset by an average reduction in selling prices

the ecp sales increase of for was driven by the following factors first  an expanded commercial sales force 
we aggressively pursued new business opportunities and were successful on many of these fronts 
second  we significantly reduced our manufacturing lead times at our canton  massachusetts facility  which allowed us to be more responsive to our customers needs 
reduced lead times allowed us to win customer orders that would normally have gone to other suppliers 
the third factor that contributed to our positive commercial results was favorable market dynamics 
the oil and gas exploration market was robust due to the increased demand for products used in pipeline inspections  pressure monitoring and measurement while drilling applications 
in addition  we saw an increase in demand for power sources used in wave monitoring and seismic recording  due to increased tsunami related concerns  mainly in the international markets 
cost of sales the impact on cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the following factors caption year ended december  
del production efficiencies primarily associated with higher volumes a excess capacity at wet tantalum capacitor and tijuana facilities b lower imc selling prices c profit sharing accruals and incentive compensation d warranty e other total percentage point impact on cost of sales as a percentage of sales del 
a 
this decrease in cost of sales was primarily due to the fact that as production volumes increase  fixed costs such as plant overhead and depreciation do not increase at the same rate 
b 
during  two facilities were not being utilized to their full capacity 
the capacitor facility was initially established to handle higher levels of production quantities 
the tijuana facility was new for and as a result its floor space and infrastructure were under utilized 
see the cost savings and consolidation section of this item for additional information 
c 
sales prices for imc products are subject to pricing agreements with customers 
many times these agreements allow for changes in price due to customer specific levels of demand 
d 
based on several metrics  s profit sharing and incentive calculations were higher than in e 
we incurred incremental warranty costs in to settle customer claims related to the imc segment

these expenses were offset by the qhr battery product line moving from the development stage into production million 
the gross costs in each year were offset by repayments for development efforts for projects where the company is reimbursed for achieving certain development milestones 
these reimbursements were lower in compared to  resulting in the increase in net expense

the manufacturing process related to this equipment did not match our overall manufacturing strategy 
remaining expenditures in and were primarily for asset disposals of approximately million and million  respectively 
d 
the charge is associated with patents acquired in the second quarter of these patents cover how capacitors are used in an icd 
although management believes the patents could have been successfully challenged in court proceedings  a decision was made to acquire the patents and remove this as a potential obstacle for existing customers to more fully adopt wet tantalum technology and for potential customers to initially adopt the technology

interest expense and interest income interest expense in was consistent with  and was primarily related to the contingent convertible notes 
interest income increased during in comparison to due to higher interest rates on higher cash and short term investment balances 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate is below the united states statutory rate primarily as a result of federal research and development tax credits and the allowable eti for the effective tax rate in was higher than in primarily due to the recognition of a valuation allowance against state investment tax credits that were no longer deemed more likely than not to be realized
