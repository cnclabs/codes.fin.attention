the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the company s financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is contained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that none of these accounting policies are extraordinarily complex or require an unusual degree of judgment as these policies relate to the company s operations and financial condition 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report 
overview transcend services  inc utilizes a combination of its proprietary internet based voice and data distribution technology  customer based technology and home based medical language specialists to convert physicians voice recordings into electronic documents 
on january   we purchased medical dictation  inc mdi for million 
the purchase was financed with a million promissory note  million in cash and  of transcend common stock 
in  we repaid million of the promissory note with a combination of cash and transcend common stock 
the balance of the mdi promissory note was million as of december  on february   we repaid another million of the promissory note  reducing the balance to million 
on december   we entered into a four year million credit facility with healthcare finance group 
these transactions have had a material effect on the company s financial statements for the year ended december  
table of contents beginning january   the company began including depreciation and amortization as a separate line item in operating expenses on the consolidated statement of operations and prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
critical accounting estimates which are material to registrant a critical accounting estimate meets two criteria it requires assumptions about highly uncertain matters  and there would be a material effect on the financial statements from either using a different  also reasonable  amount within the range of the estimate in the current period or from reasonably likely period to period changes in the estimate 
our critical accounting estimates are as follows goodwill and intangible assets 
as of december   we reported goodwill and intangible assets at carrying amounts of million and  respectively 
the total of million represents approximately of total assets as of december  our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the goodwill and intangible assets are associated with two acquisitions during we review goodwill and intangibles for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in testing for impairment  we calculate the fair value of the reporting units to which the goodwill and intangibles relate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the approach utilized is dependent on a number of factors including estimates of future revenues and costs  appropriate discount rates and other variables 
we base our estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable  but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
therefore  future impairments could result if actual results differ from those estimates 
deferred tax asset 
as of december   we have approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards generating million of deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits we expect to be able to apply against future taxable income 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that we believe may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use them 
we use current estimates of future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting our future taxable income requires us to use significant judgment regarding expected future revenues and expenses 
in addition  we must assume that tax laws will not change sufficiently to materially impact the expected tax liability associated with our expected taxable income 
as of december   we have determined that we do not have sufficient information to conclude that we will more likely than not be able to utilize our deferred tax benefits in the future and accordingly  we have established a valuation allowance equal to the full amount of the deferred tax asset  or million 
we adjust the asset and allowance each quarter 
if we were to determine that the operating loss carryforwards could be used and the valuation allowance could be reduced  our net income would increase 
legal proceedings 
from time to time  we are a party to litigation 
currently  we are involved in a lawsuit with our lady of the lakes hospital  inc see item  legal proceedings for more information 
we evaluated the potential for liability based on discussions with legal counsel  the facts of this case and similar cases and determined that the amount of loss  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated 
if the facts and circumstances change and the outcome can be reasonably estimated  any loss would be recorded in the financial statements as a reduction to net income 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue increased million  or  to million in  compared to revenue of million in approximately  of this increase in revenue is attributable to the acquisition of mdi on january  excluding the additional month of revenue attributed to the mdi acquisition  revenue increased by million  consisting of million from new customers  million from existing beyondtxt customers and from existing customers on other platforms  partially offset by a decrease of  from customers who terminated their contracts
