item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition andresults of operations overview we design  manufacture  install and service highly engineered equipment for use in the fabrication of semiconductor devices 
our products are focused on the wet chemical process steps in integrated circuit  or ic  manufacturing and include systems for wafer surface preparation and electrochemical deposition  or ecd  applications 
our surface preparation systems are designed for front end of line feol  back end of line beol and wafer level packaging of ics processes 
our single wafer feol surface preparation systems are used for photoresist stripping  post etch and pre diffusion cleans 
our beol surface preparation systems are used for polymer removal and packaging applications 
our ecd systems are used to plate copper and other metals  which are used for the ic s internal wiring  or interconnects  to plate solder and lead free solder bumps for wafer level packaging applications  and to plate other metals for various semiconductor and related applications 
also  our surface preparation systems are used for cleaning and etching processes for wafer level packaging 
our primary product for all of these processes is the raider platform  which is a multi chamber single wafer tool 
our products address critical applications within the semiconductor manufacturing process  and help enable our customers to manufacture more advanced semiconductor devices that feature higher levels of performance 
the fabrication of semiconductor devices typically requires several hundred manufacturing steps  with the number of steps continuing to increase for advanced devices 
due to the breadth of our product portfolio and advanced technology capabilities  our solutions address over of these manufacturing steps 
there are several key trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry driving growth in demand for wafer surface preparation  ecd and other advanced semiconductor equipment smaller device features for lower cost and higher performance  new materials to fabricate more advanced semiconductor devices  increased use of mm wafers to reduce manufacturing costs  move to single wafer processing technologies for enhanced surface preparation  wafer level and other advanced packaging to enable smaller portable products  and emerging need for thinned wafers and chip stacking driven by the demand for smaller portable devices 
as the semiconductor manufacturing process increases in complexity and production parameters become even more stringent  semiconductor manufacturers increasingly rely upon manufacturers of semiconductor equipment to achieve improved process control  provide a smaller equipment footprint and lower the cost of ownership of their manufacturing processes 
key elements of our solution include technological leadership  a comprehensive product portfolio  including our raider platform and vertically integrated manufacturing and design capabilities 
key performance indicators our management focuses on revenues  gross margin  operating expenses and profitability in managing our business 
in addition to these financial measures found in our consolidated financial statements  we also use bookings  backlog  shipments  deferred revenue and shipment based results of operations 
bookings are firm orders for which we have received written customer authorization in the fiscal period 
backlog is the balance of undelivered orders at the end of a fiscal period 
in order to be included in bookings or backlog  an order must be scheduled to ship within the next months 
backlog and forecasted orders drive our production schedule 
shipments measure how well we have met our production plan and are viewed as a primary measure of factory output 
deferred revenue primarily represents tool shipments for which we are awaiting final customer acceptance 
a summary of key factors that impacted our financial performance during fiscal year includes our fiscal bookings were million and include million in bookings for our raider platform 
fourth quarter fiscal bookings were million 
our consolidated orders backlog of million and deferred revenue of million resulted in a revenue backlog of million at september  shipments in fiscal were million including million from raider shipments 
net income was million  or  on net sales of million in fiscal compared with net income of million  or  on net sales of million in fiscal our gross margin increased to of net sales  up from in fiscal an inventory write off in the fourth quarter of fiscal negatively impacted fiscal year margins by approximately one percentage point 
cash and cash equivalents were million at september   a decrease of million from million at september  results of operations the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended september  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development downsizing costs gain on sale of building total operating expenses income from operations other income expense income before income taxes income tax provision benefit net income fiscal compared with fiscal and fiscal net sales year ended september  dollars in millions net sales by product line semiconductor equipment license fees by geographical distribution  percentage of net tool sales north america europe asia  including japan net sales consist of revenues from sales of semiconductor equipment  spare parts and service and royalties 
our revenue recognition policy provides that revenue from sales of semiconductor equipment may be recognizable upon shipment if the product is an existing tool to a customer environment in which we have already successfully installed and gained acceptance of our products and the revenue recognition criteria in sab  revenue recognition have been met 
alternatively  revenue will be deferred and only recognized upon final customer acceptance for tools that are new products or where an existing tool is sold into a new customer environment 
revenue for elements other than equipment  such as installation revenue  is included in tool acceptance revenue 
license fee revenue represents fees generated from our anode technology 
net sales declined or million to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal business activity levels declined and we experienced a slow down in our bookings in the first three quarters of fiscal revenues for ecd raiders for copper interconnect applications increased by over as compared with fiscal levels while revenues from our wafer level packaging applications decreased by approximately 
revenues for our single wafer surface preparation raiders for feol applications increased approximately while revenues for beol cleans applications declined approximately from prior year levels 
feol tools benefited from the transition away from batch processing to single wafer processing to more closely control cleaning processes of smaller geometry devices whereas beol applications for current industry standard mm wafer fabs had previously made the transition to single wafer and were affected by the overall decline in semiconductor industry business levels 
overall  revenues from our raider platform contributed just more than to our fiscal revenues and while raider revenue declined in absolute dollars  the decline is the equivalent of two or three tools 
revenues from automated and manual batch tools  used primarily for cleaning applications declined by approximately million when compared with fiscal levels as single wafer processing continues to supplant batch processing in mm fabs 
the revenue contribution from spare parts  service and from our rhetech subsidiary was proportionate with fiscal levels 
net sales increased or million to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal in general  business activity levels increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal as all product lines showed improvement over fiscal levels 
revenue from both shipments and acceptances of single wafer surface preparation raiders for feol and beol cleans applications and ecd raiders for interconnect applications accounted for almost of fiscal sales and for more than of the increase in sales over fiscal levels 
our raider tool base continued to expand  allowing us to recognize more revenue upon tool shipment as evidenced by the increase in revenue from shipments in fiscal as compared to fiscal and the decrease in revenue from tool acceptances from fiscal spare parts sales contributed more than to the increase in fiscal revenues while sales at our rhetech subsidiary added almost to the increase in revenues over fiscal levels 
geographically  the north american and european markets were our leading market areas in fiscal  although we see additional opportunity in asia when we compare ourselves to the rest of the industry 
european tool sales increased sharply making it our leading market area for tool sales in fiscal contributing to total tool sales 
this represents an increase of from fiscal levels and from fiscal levels 
north american tool sales were essentially flat in fiscal as compared with fiscal  declining approximately one percentage point to of total tool sales 
both fiscal and fiscal represent a strong increase from fiscal north american tool sales of 
asian tool sales declined to of total tool sales in fiscal after contributing and  respectively  in fiscal and fiscal we continue to place a strong focus on our sales and marketing efforts in this region and anticipate stronger sales in the asian market in fiscal gross profit year ended september  dollars in thousands gross profit    percentage of net sales gross profit declined million in absolute dollars or in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross profit increased million or in fiscal compared to the fiscal gross profit of million 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal after decreasing percentage points in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit decreased in absolute dollars in fiscal because of lower sales volumes and improved by percentage points from fiscal margins improved a combined three percentage points on tool revenues  spare parts and service revenues and on sales from our rhetech subsidiary 
our tool margins improved on copper interconnect  feol and beol tools 
margin improvements were realized in both north america and asia 
installation revenues contributed more to overall revenue in both absolute dollars and on a percentage basis 
warranty and installation expense decreased in fiscal  contributing approximately one percentage point to the margin increase 
these margin improvements were partially offset by increased obsolescence and inventory reserve charges in the fourth quarter related to product enhancements on our raider tool line that rendered certain component parts obsolete 
gross profit increased in absolute dollars in fiscal because of higher sales volumes but declined by percentage points from fiscal the gross margin percentage was negatively impacted by selected tool installations of new applications for first time customers 
one time pricing incentives coupled  in certain instances  with increased manufacturing costs  impacted the gross margin by approximately four percentage points in fiscal the gross margin benefited slightly by a one time order cancellation fee in the second quarter while increased warranty and installation costs also reduced the gross margin by approximately one percentage point in fiscal selling  general and administrative year ended september  dollars in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include employment costs for sales  marketing  customer support and administrative personnel as well as travel  communications  professional fees and expenses related to sales and service offices at our global locations 
sg a expenses decreased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal and increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to up from in fiscal but down from in fiscal in response to a slowdown in the semiconductor industry  we implemented a plan to align our cost structure with our business outlook for the remainder of the fiscal year in april the plan consisted primarily of a seven percent reduction in our worldwide work force  management pay cuts  reduced overtime and mandatory leave 
as a result  travel  aircraft and general business costs decreased over the course of the year 
employment costs increased million over fiscal levels primarily related to expenses incurred prior to the implementation of the cost alignment plan in the second half of fiscal employment costs decreased million in the second half of fiscal commission expense declined million in fiscal related to our transition to a direct marketing and sales force in taiwan and china 
professional fees also declined in fiscal as compared with fiscal as fiscal professional fees included certain duplicate expenses related to the change in our external auditors 
employment costs increased million in fiscal as compared with fiscal as we increased staff to support expanded business activity and recorded stock based compensation expense 
in fiscal  we completed our plan to transition from using an outsourced sales representative in taiwan and china to maintaining a direct sales and customer service presence in those locations 
as a result  we saved an estimated million in sales representative commission expense in taiwan and china in fiscal the combination of commission expense and direct expenses associated with our transition to a direct sales and service presence in taiwan and china has resulted in some duplication of expenses but we expect this change from a variable cost structure to a fixed cost structure will improve our profitability in the future 
professional fees decreased in fiscal reflecting reduced audit and compliance fees related to the sarbanes oxley act of travel and other expenses related to expanded business activity and customer support increased 
these increases were partially offset by decreased legal costs 
research and development year ended september  dollars in thousands research and development    percentage of net sales research and development r d expense consists of salaries  project materials  laboratory costs  consulting fees and other costs associated with our product development efforts 
r d expense increased million or from of net sales to of net sales in fiscal as compared with fiscal r d expense increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal and decreased slightly from of net sales in fiscal increasing million  prototype expense was the primary driver in the million increase in r d expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal our surface preparation research and development efforts were focused on feol cleaning applications  wafer edge cleaning processes and related equipment 
ecd r d focused on the development of a new processing chamber capable of plating copper for devices at the nanometer node and below  deep via applications  direct on barrier plating  thin seed layer enhancement processes  porous silicon processes and related equipment 
r d projects also included a single wafer copper annealing process 
travel expense increased in fiscal related to increased process support for our tools 
prototype expenses increased approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal as we expanded our research and development efforts 
our research and development efforts were focused on the following projects which include feol cleaning applications  edge cleaning processes and equipment and integrated megasonic cleans 
ecd r d focused on the development of proprietary processes and power supply hardware to provide arbitrary wave form and dynamic current control for damascene plating  direct on barrier and thin seed layer processes  porous silicon processes and equipment and deep via applications 
r d projects also included mini batch vacuum furnace anneal and thru silicon via tsv plating required for three dimensional chip stacking 
during fiscal  we and other semiconductor equipment companies and research institutes formed a consortium called emc d  whose mission is to develop the processes and equipment needed for tsv technology 
depreciation expense increased approximately million as we replaced older technology tools in our demonstration laboratories with new generation raider platform tools 
employment costs increased approximately million in the year to date comparison reflecting increased staff levels and stock based compensation expense 
general operating expenses increased reflecting expanded business activity 
our research and development expense has fluctuated from period to period in the past 
we expect such fluctuations to continue in the future  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales  primarily due to the timing of expenditures and fluctuations in the level of net sales in a given period 
we expect to continue to fund research and development expenditures with a multi year perspective and are committed to technology leadership in our sector of the semiconductor equipment industry 
downsizing costs year ended september  dollars in thousands downsizing costs percentage of net sales in april  we announced and implemented a plan to align our cost structure with current business activity levels 
the cost reduction plan consisted primarily of a seven percent reduction in our worldwide work force  management pay cuts  reduced overtime and mandatory leave 
one time involuntary termination costs of  were reported as a separate component of operating expenses in our fiscal third quarter 
all costs related to the downsizing plan were fully incurred in the third quarter 
net of the downsizing costs  we saved approximately million in employment  travel and general business expenses in the second half of fiscal as compared with spending in the first half of fiscal gain on sale of building year ended september  dollars in thousands gain on sale of building percentage of net sales we sold a manufacturing facility located near kalispell  montana during the first quarter of fiscal for approximately million and recognized a gain on the sale of approximately  other income expense year ended september  in thousands interest income interest expense foreign exchange gain loss other  total other income expense  net other income expense increased to a net other income of  in fiscal from a net other expense of  in fiscal and a net other income of million in fiscal in fiscal  we reported commission income of approximately  from starview technology  inc  a provider of manufacturing software for the semiconductor industry in which mr 
thompson  our chairman and chief executive officer and his son in law  thomas sulzbacher  are majority shareholders 
we also reported rental income of a portion of our cambridge facility 
interest income declined to  in fiscal from  in fiscal because of lower investment levels 
interest expense increased to  in fiscal because of increased use of our line of credit 
in october  we received a seed layer enhancement litigation settlement payment of million from novellus systems  inc which accounted for most of the fiscal net  other income 
we reported an exchange gain of  in fiscal as compared to exchange losses of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  related to fluctuations in the yen  euro and british pound 
beginning in april  due to a change in how we conduct business and following an evaluation of the scope of our operations and business practices  we concluded that the euro is the currency of the primary economic environment in which semitool austria operates and  consequently  changed the functional currency for semitool austria to the euro 
semitool austria invoices its customers in euros and its financing and operating activities are denominated in the euro 
accordingly  from april   all assets and liabilities of semitool austria are translated at period end exchange rates and all revenues and expenses are re measured at average rates prevailing during the period 
translation adjustments are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
income taxes year ended september  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit    effective tax rate our estimated effective full year tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of as compared to the effective tax rate for fiscal of 
our fiscal year tax rate is lower than in fiscal based on a combination of the extension of the federal research and experimentation credit credit in fiscal for fiscal  the current year estimated credit and the decline in our net income before taxes nibt from million in fiscal to million in fiscal while the fiscal year nibt decreased  the qualified research expenditures affecting the credit are estimated to remain near the level generated on the fiscal year tax return  the combination of which results in a reduction of the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
the effective rate was also impacted by additional montana r d credits realized in excess of prior estimates and a tax benefit realized in the united kingdom for an exchange loss incurred translating statutory financial statements from the great britain pound to the us dollar 
for fiscal year  we recorded an income tax benefit of million as compared to a tax provision of million for the corresponding period of fiscal year the first quarter of fiscal year included a benefit of  related to the extension of the credit as it pertains to our fiscal year legislation to extend the credit was signed into law after the close of our fiscal year on september   therefore we were unable to recognize the full credit in fiscal the third quarter of fiscal year includes a benefit of  due to an increase in the research and experimentation credit and deductions related to foreign sales on our fiscal year us income tax return 
our estimated effective tax rate increased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was higher compared to the rate used for fiscal because the federal research credit expired in december as of september   no extension of the research credit had been enacted by congress 
the expensing of stock based awards in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r share based payment  and the limited deductibility of those awards in some jurisdictions  also contributed to the increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year our future effective tax rate is based on our continued investments in research and development programs qualifying for the credit and our expectations of earnings from operations in jurisdictions with lower tax rates throughout the world 
backlog and deferred revenue september  dollars in millions backlog percentage change in backlog year over year deferred revenue percentage change in deferred revenue year over year approximately of our current backlog is for raider tools 
deferred revenue increased million at september  as compared with september  primarily because of shipments of raiders into either new customer environments or into japan  where title does not transfer until final customer acceptance  both of which require full deferral of tool revenue until final customer acceptance in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
current deferrals include all or a part of raiders as compared with raiders at september  and raiders at september  the fiscal figure includes a higher percentage of raiders that represented new tools shipped into new customer environments  requiring full deferral of revenue on those tools 
we include in backlog those customer orders for which we have written customer authorization and for which shipment is scheduled within the next months 
orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers with limited or no cancellation fees 
as the result of systems ordered and shipped in the same quarter  possible changes in customer delivery dates  cancellations and shipment delays and acceptances of shipped equipment carried in deferred revenue  the backlog at any particular date and the bookings for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of actual revenue for any succeeding period 
in particular  during periods of downturns in the semiconductor industry we have experienced cancellations and significant shipment delays 
deferred profit included in current liabilities is derived from deferred revenue  which primarily relates to equipment shipped to customers that has not been accepted by the customer  less the deferred cost of sales  including warranty and installation  and commission expenses 
deferred revenue is not included in orders backlog 
stock based compensation effective the beginning of fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  and elected to adopt the modified prospective application method 
sfas no 
r requires us to use a fair value based method to account for stock based compensation 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the value of publicly traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
our employee stock options have characteristics that differ from those of publicly traded options 
total compensation cost recorded in fiscal and fiscal was million and million  respectively  or million and  after tax  respectively  in each period  an impact of approximately per basic and diluted share in both periods 
through fiscal  we accounted for our stock option plans using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

liquidity and capital resources operating activities 
operations provided million in cash during fiscal the primary use of cash in fiscal was a million decrease in accounts payable as our payables declined due to lower business activity levels compared to fiscal as a result of the inventory reduction plan implemented in the third quarter as well as a write off of obsolete inventory in the fourth quarter  inventories declined by million 
customer advances decreased million as we shipped the tools underlying those advances 
income taxes payable and payroll related liabilities decreased million 
the primary sources of cash from operations during fiscal were net income of million and non cash components of net income including million in depreciation and amortization expense offset by a million decrease in deferred income taxes 
in fiscal  cash used by operations was million 
the primary uses of cash were increased trade receivables of million as a result of higher sales levels and increased inventory of million to support increased sales volume 
work in process inventory grew million and raw materials inventory grew million to support current and expected shipment volumes and to ensure adequate inventory was available near our customers locations to support their operations 
offsetting these uses of cash were a million increase in accounts payable  a million increase in customer advances  net income of million and changes in non cash components of net income including million in depreciation and amortization expense and million in stock based compensation expense offset by a million decrease in deferred income taxes 
investing activities 
investing activities in fiscal included million in purchases of factory and laboratory equipment  other property and the expansion and remodeling of our rhetech subsidiary facility 
additionally we invested million in our development and demonstration laboratories by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
these investments in our equipment and facilities were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment  primarily a manufacturing facility located near kalispell  montana  which we sold for approximately million 
we also invested a net amount of million in our patent portfolio 
investing activities in fiscal primarily consisted of million in purchases of property  plant and equipment including the acquisition  remodeling and equipping of our new fabrication facility  the completion of the manufacturing and office facility in salzburg  austria  the remodeling and expansion of the raider production floor and the initial phases of a remodeling and expansion project at our rhetech subsidiary in coopersburg  pennsylvania 
we invested million in our development and demonstration laboratories primarily for tools on our raider platform by transferring finished goods inventory to property  plant and equipment 
we continued to invest in intellectual property rights which used cash of million 
financing activities 
financing activities in fiscal provided cash of million and consisted primarily of million in borrowings under long term debt for our rhetech subsidiary expansion and remodeling project and million in new long term debt used to finance the acquisition  remodeling and equipping of a manufacturing facility located near kalispell  montana 
the million financing with first interstate bank is under a value added loan program sponsored by the montana board of investments mboi 
the mboi participation in of the loan carries an interest rate of for the first five years and for the second five years of a ten year term 
the of the loan financed by first interstate bank has a interest rate over the ten year term 
stock option exercises also provided million in fiscal offsetting these sources of cash  we repaid short term borrowings of million on our revolving line of credit in fiscal there are currently no advances outstanding on the revolving credit line 
financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of approximately million in cash proceeds from an equity offering of three million shares of common stock in december  net borrowings under our revolving credit facility of approximately million  borrowings under long term debt of million  primarily for the new facility being constructed in austria and million from the exercise of stock options 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to the types of financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
the following commitments as of september   incurred in the normal course of business  have been included in the consolidated financial statements with the exception of purchase order commitments and operating lease obligations  which are properly excluded under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
they are disclosed in the following table in order to provide a consolidated picture of our financial position and liquidity 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt      capital lease obligations operating leases   purchase order commitments   total commitments      we have agreements with limited liability companies wholly owned by mr 
raymon f 
thompson  our chairman and chief executive officer  to lease aircraft and an aircraft hangar 
under these agreements  rent expense was approximately  for the year ended september  and  in each of the years ended september  and the current rental rate is approximately  per month for both the aircraft and the hangar  the lease terms are month to month and therefore are not included in the above table 
the terms of the lease agreements were based on comparable information on lease rates received from independent aircraft leasing dealers and finance entities for similar aircraft 
we believe that these lease agreements are on terms no less favorable to us than could have been obtained from an unaffiliated party 
during the fiscal years through  the company acted as a sales representative to starview technology  inc  a provider of manufacturing software for the semiconductor industry in which mr 
thompson and his son in law  thomas sulzbacher  are majority shareholders 
the company earned sales commissions from starview technology in the amount of  in fiscal in december  we sold a condominium located in kalispell  montana to larry e 
murphy  our president and chief operating officer  for  in cash 
the condominium had previously been used to provide short term housing to employees who were not located in the kalispell area 
the terms were negotiated with mr 
murphy based on the estimated current market value of the condominium 
as of september   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our million revolving line of credit 
the credit facility is with wells fargo and bears interest at the bank s prime lending rate  as of september   or at our option  libor plus  or as of that date 
the revolving credit line expires on march  the credit agreement has various restrictive covenants including a prohibition against pledging real  fixed or intangible assets during the term of the agreement and the maintenance of various financial covenants 
if we were to default on the credit agreement or if there were a materially adverse change in our financial condition  the bank could accelerate payment of any advances outstanding under the credit agreement 
in addition  the availability of funds requires compliance with certain financial covenants 
we currently are in compliance with our debt covenants  however  there is no assurance that in the future we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants so as to ensure availability of the line 
we believe that we have sufficient cash and cash equivalents  along with funds expected to be generated from operations and amounts available under our credit facility to meet operating expenses and planned capital expenditures through fiscal and into the foreseeable future 
however  continued growth in shipments of product may require additional funding 
we estimate capital expenditures will be between million and million during the next twelve months 
we currently have an effective shelf registration statement  which registers the offer and sale of up to an aggregate million of our securities 
if additional financial resources are required in the future  we expect either to issue securities from the shelf registration statement or to issue other financial instruments  whichever management deems advisable 
of course  there can be no assurance that in the future we will be able to issue additional common stock or other financial instruments on acceptable terms 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  warranty obligations  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  employee benefits  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is significant because revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we recognize revenue under the guidance for staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition 
under this method  revenue is recognized only when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our product sales generally contain substantive customer acceptance provisions 
sales of new products to new or existing customers are not recognized until customer acceptance 
likewise  sales of existing products to new customer environments are not recognized until customer acceptance 
if multiple elements exist  sales of existing products into existing customer environments are treated as such in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the amount of revenue recognized in multiple element arrangements is the lesser of the fair value of the equipment or the contracted amount that was due or payable upon title transfer 
the revenue for elements other than equipment is recorded in deferred profit and is recognized when the remaining goods and or services are delivered or performed 
revenue related to service is recognized upon completion of performance of the service or ratably over the life of the related service contract 
spare parts sales are recognized upon shipment when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
unearned revenue from service contract agreements is included in customer advances in the current liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  the timing of certain expenses  such as cost of sales  including installation and warranty  and commission expenses coincides with the recognition of the related revenues 
we follow specific guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments such as the definition of a new customer environment and new acceptance criteria or if installation is perfunctory may be required in the application of our revenue recognition policy 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
accordingly  we write down the carrying value of inventories for estimated obsolescence and future marketability 
on a quarterly basis  we compare historical and projected sales and usage of raw materials and parts and our assumptions about future use of raw materials  parts and finished goods with our forecast  market demand and industry conditions to determine potential obsolescence or whether the inventory on hand represents excess quantities 
as a result of our analysis  we record reserves impacting cost of sales  if appropriate 
these reserves are subject to management judgment and if actual future use  demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory valuation write downs may be required 
warranty obligations 
we provide for the estimated cost of equipment warranties when the related revenue is recognized 
we track individual warranties on a tool by tool basis and develop estimated rates by equipment class based on this history 
the rates are used to estimate the warranty accrual for a given specific piece of equipment 
these rates are revised periodically to reflect current cost trends due to the current life cycle of that product class 
the warranty accrual is reduced by actual costs of providing the warranty or if a balance is remaining at the end of the warranty period  then that amount is also written off 
warranty accrual expense impacts primarily cost of sales 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record expense as a component of selling  general and administrative within the consolidated statements of income 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  due to the cyclicality of the industries we serve or for other reasons  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and expense may be required 
likewise  if we are successfully able to collect on an amount presumed to be uncollectible  the allowance for doubtful accounts and the related expense may be reduced 
in general  it takes longer to collect payment in the capital equipment industry than in certain other industries 
days sales outstanding dso of peer companies in our industry ranges between approximately and days 
deferred tax assets 
we make estimates to determine the amount of our deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  however  should we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  a decrease in the deferred tax asset would negatively impact our results of operations  particularly the income tax provision  in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective application method and began accounting for stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information which can change significantly over time 
a small change in the estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock options  consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
r  sab no 
and our prior period pro forma disclosures of net earnings  including stock based compensation determined under a fair value method as prescribed by sfas no 

we estimate stock price volatility based on a blended rate of historical volatility and the implied volatility derived from traded options on our stock 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after fiscal  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
as of september   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock option awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company accounted for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method under apb no 
and had adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

litigation we are involved in legal proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business  including employment related litigations 
although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate disposition of these matters  it is the opinion of management  based upon the information available at this time  that the currently expected outcome of these matters  individually or in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no
