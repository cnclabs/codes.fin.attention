critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding our other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to our liner services and rail ferry service segments voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage 
revenues and expenses relating to our other segments voyages  which require no estimates or assumptions  are recorded when earned or incurred during the reporting period 
on our liner services  the voyage revenues are known at the beginning of the vessel s voyage and are reported through the date of the financial statements based on the relative transit time  which is the time between the vessel s loading port to the vessel s discharge port 
variances from initial revenue estimates are generally not material 
voyage expenditures are estimated at the beginning of the vessel s voyage based on historical cost standards and current estimates received from our vendors and port agents 
provisions for loss voyages are recorded when contra cts for the voyages are fixed and when losses become apparent for voyages in progress 
during the course of the vessel s voyage  typically to days for our liner services  actual costs replace the original estimates and become part of the historical cost standards 
because of our on going voyage review process  all variances from our original revenue and expense estimates are reported timely and generally are not material or recurring 
depreciation provisions for depreciation are computed on the straight line method based on estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets 
various methods are used to estimate the useful lives and salvage values of our depreciable assets and due to the capital intensive nature of our business and our large base of depreciable assets  changes in such estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations 
drydocking costs we defer certain costs related to the drydocking of our vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
because drydocking charges can be material in any one period  we believe that the acceptable deferred method provides a better matching for the amortization of those costs over future revenue periods benefiting from the drydocking of our vessel 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
provisions for income taxes include deferred income taxes that are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain of our foreign operations are subject to us income taxes when those earnings are repatriated to the us the jobs creation act  which became effective for our company on january   changed the united states tax treatment of the foreign operations of our us flag vessels and our foreign flag shipping operations 
we made an election under th e jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under a new tonnage tax regime rather than under the usual us corporate income tax regime 
self retention insurance we maintain provisions for estimated losses under our self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish self insurance provisions for hull and machinery and loss of hire for each policy year based on estimates from independent actuaries and management  and to generally maintain the provisions at those levels for the estimated run off period  approximately two years from the inception of that period 
we also establish provisions for p i insurance deductibles based on internal estimates 
we believe most claims will be reported  or estimates for existing claims will be revised  within this two year period 
subsequent to this two year period  self insurance provisions are adjusted to reflect our current estimate of loss exposure for the policy year 
our estimates are determined based on various factors  such as severity of the injury for personal injuries and estimated potential liability based on past judgments and settlements  advice from legal counsel based on its assessment of the facts of the case and its experience in other cases  probability of pre trial settlement which would mitigate legal costs  historical experience on claims for each specific type of cargo for cargo damage claims  and whether our seamen are employed in permanent positions or temporary revolving positions 
it is reasonably possible that changes in our estimated exposure may occur from time to time 
however  if during this two year period our estimate of loss exposure exceeds the actuarial estimate  then additional loss provisions are recorded to increase the self insurance provisions to our estimate of the eventual claims settlement cost 
the measurement of our exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
asbestos claims we maintain provisions for estimated losses for asbestos claims based on estimates of eventual claims settlement costs 
our policy is to establish provisions based on a range of estimated exposure 
we estimate this potential range of exposure using input from legal counsel and internal estimates based on the individual deductible levels for each policy year 
we are also indemnified for certain of these claims by the previous owner of one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the measurement of our exposure for asbestos liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of the loss provisions recorded during the period 
our estimates and assumptions are formed from variables such as the maximum deductible levels in a claim year  the amount of the indemnification recovery and the claimant s employment history with the company 
actual results could differ from those estimate s 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies as prescribed by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  inflation  rate of compensation increases  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
we believe that the assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our outside actuary and information as to historical experience and performance 
differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and postretirement obligations and future expense 
in september of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this statement requires balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans 
under sfas no 
 actuarial gains and losses  prior service costs or credits  and any remaining transition assets or obligations that have not been recognized under previous accounting standards must be recognized in other comprehensive income  net of tax effects  until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  the measurement date  the date at which plan assets and the benefit obligation are measured  is required to be the company s fiscal year end 
sfas no 
does not change the determination of net periodic benefit cost included in net income or the measurement issues associated with benefit plan accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have adopted sfas no 
and the effect of this statement as of december  on our financial position was an increase to recorded liabilities of million  an increase to deferred tax assets of  and a decrease in other accumulated comprehensive income of million 
results of operations our vessels are operated under a variety of charters and contracts 
the nature of these arrangements is such that  without a material variation in gross voyage profits total revenues less voyage expenses and vessel and barge depreciation  the revenues and expenses attributable to a vessel deployed under one type of charter or contract can differ substantially from those attributable to the same vessel if deployed under a different type of charter or contract 
accordingly  depending on the mix of charters or contracts in place during a particular accounting period  our revenues and expenses can fluctuate substantially from one period to another even though the number of vessels deployed  the number of voyages completed  the amount of cargo carried  and the gross voyage profit derived from the vessels remain relatively constant 
as a result  fluctuations in voyage revenues and expenses are not necessarily ind icative of trends in profitability  and our management believes that gross voyage profit is a more appropriate measure of operating performance than revenues 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses variations in gross voyage profits rather than variations in revenues 
executive summary our net income for the year ended december  was million  which included pre tax gains of million on the sale of our minority investment in another company and million on the sale of a lash vessel and related lash barges and an impairment loss of million 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  which included after tax losses of million associated with the hurricanes that affected the us gulf coast during that year 
in november of  we sold our entire investment in belden shipholding pte ltd  a company that owns and operates cement carrier vessels  for million 
the sale was pursuant to an unsolicited offer and resulted in the aforementioned pre tax gain of million 
we are exploring various options for utilizing the proceeds from this sale 
during  our operating loss was million  after considering gains on sales of assets of million and a non cash impairment loss of million related to our investment in a terminal associated with our rail ferry service 
during  operating income was million 
our operating results in were primarily affected by a decrease in gross voyage profit from our liner services segment due to a decrease in the cargo available for our transatlantic lash service 
in the fourth quarter of  we restructured this service to reduce its capacity to a level that we believe the market can support  resulting in the gain of million on the sale of the lash vessel and barges mentioned earlier 
as we have discussed in previous reports  our rail ferry service conducts its us operations from a terminal located in new orleans  louisiana 
the waterway on which that terminal is located was affected by hurricane katrina during  and is effectively closed for long term deep draft utilization 
this has required us to relocate the us operations elsewhere on the us gulf coast 
we have entered agreements with the state of alabama to move our service to mobile  alabama during  along with our corporate headquarters  which are currently also located in new orleans 
upon making the final determination to relocate the terminal  we assessed the options for utilizing our investment in the terminal in new orleans after the mobile terminal is completed and available for our use 
that analysis resulted in the impairment charge of million to write down our net investment in that ter minal 
as discussed later in the liquidity and capital resources section  we have received incentives from the state of alabama that will cover a significant portion of the cost of constructing the terminal and the relocation of corporate headquarters 
operationally  the rail ferry service carried more cargo during than in  resulting in slightly improved results in the most recent year 
our operating results during reflect a positive contribution from our time charter contracts segment  which improved over primarily due to the addition of another us flag pure car truck carrier pctc during late that operated for the full year we have continued to see a strong worldwide demand for ocean transportation of fully assembled automobiles and trucks that has provided high vessel utilization by the time charterers of our eight pctc s 
operating results were also impacted at the end of by the cost associated with terminating the lease of an intermodal transfer facility previously utilized in our liner services segment 
while the high cost of fuel oil continued to affect our industry  we have been able to offset most of the cost increases by collecting fuel surcharges from the customers of our transatlantic liner service and our rail ferry service 
we reduced our interest expense in as compared to primarily by repurchasing some of our senior notes in the second half of and during our administrative and general expenses increased in as compared to primarily due to one time costs associated with the relocation of corporate headquarters  professional services fees  and employee bonus expenses 
from our unconsolidated entities  our ownership in a company that operates bulk carriers produced higher results in than in due to the strong demand for bulk cargoes  and our ownership in a cement carrier company  which was sold late in  had positive operational results 
the cement carrier company had lower results than in  because the previous year s results included a gain on the sale of certain vessels 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in the gross profit in included an impairment loss of million on our investment in the rail ferry service s terminal in new orleans 
gross voyage profit before the impairment loss decreased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner services gross voyage loss for this segment increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the foreign flag transatlantic service was impacted by a drop in eastbound cargo volumes  and the us flag service was primarily affected by time out of service for unscheduled repairs to the vessel operating in that service 
the decrease in cargo availability for the transatlantic service was in part due to an embargo by the european union on certain shipments of rice from the us higher operating expenses during were partially related to higher fuel prices 
however  fuel surcharges on our transatlantic service during that period  which are recognized in revenue  substantially offset that service s higher fuel costs 
during the third quarter of  we re evaluated the transatlantic service and decided to reduce the capacity of that service from two lash vessels to one during the fourth quarter due to the aforementioned changes in the market 
see the liquidity and capital resources section for further discussion of restructuring of the transatlantic liner service 
time charter contracts the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was primarily due to the addition of our fifth us flag pctc in september of the increase in gross voyage profit was partially offset by our coal carrier being out of service for days in for capital improvements and for a periodic special survey as required for classification standards 
the capital improvements were necessary to replace some of the vessel s steel as part of the special survey 
additionally  the special survey  including drydocking  was originally scheduled for  but was instead performed concurrently with the capital improvements for economic efficiency 
the vessel returned to service in june of and continued its firm time charter employment through the end of the year 
although the vessel substantially fulfilled i ts obligation under the time charter contract  it was not available for further utilization by the charter or for commercial hire  as it was during  due to the time out of service 
contract of affreightment gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in this segment  which consists of a contract associated with our molten sulphur carrier  was impacted by less available tonnage above the contract minimum in as compared to rail ferry service gross voyage results before impairment loss for this segment improved slightly from a loss of million in to a loss of million in improved operations resulting from higher cargo volumes were mostly offset by higher depreciation related to capital improvements to the terminal in new orleans  which began operating in the second half of  and to the vessels used in the service in late and early the increase in the depreciation of the terminal in new orleans only affected the first half of because the net investment in that terminal was written down to zero at the end of the second quarter of when we determined that it was impaired 
we will not begin depreciating the terminal in mobile until it is completed  which is expected to be in the beginning of the second quarter of the impairment loss of million recorded in the second quarter of was related to our investment in the rail ferry service s terminal in new orleans located on the mr go 
after hurricane katrina struck the gulf coast in  dredging of the mr go was indefinitely suspended by the army corps of engineers  effectively closing it to long term deep draft shipping 
this resulted in our decision to relocate our rail ferry service s us terminal operations from new orleans to mobile  alabama  which we expect to occur by the beginning of the second quarter of after reviewing the options available to us for utilization of the assets that will remain at the new orleans terminal following the relocation  we determined that our net investment of million in those assets was impaired 
the estimated cost and funding of the new terminal being constructed in mobile are discus sed in the liquidity and capital resources section later in this report 
other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to  in primarily due to nonrecurring expenses in of million related to terminating the lease of an intermodal terminal facility in memphis  tennessee 
the facility was previously used in our liner services segment 
we have been monitoring the cargo being processed through that facility and evaluating other uses for the facility  and late in  we decided to terminate the lease 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily associated with one time costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters  higher fees for professional services  and employee bonus expenses 
the gain on the sale of other assets of million in primarily related to the sale of one of our lash vessels and certain lash barges previously utilized in our liner services segment 
the gain on the sale of other assets of  in primarily related to the sale of lash barges no longer needed for operations 
interest expense increased from million in to million in the increase was primarily due to new financing agreements entered into in the fourth quarter of associated with the acquisition of a pctc and our share of the cost of the improvements to the new orleans rail ferry terminal 
higher interest rates on our variable rate loans also contributed to the increase during the year 
of our million of long term debt outstanding as of december   million is subject to variable interest rates 
reductions in interest expense resulting from the repurchase of million of our senior notes in and regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt partially offset the increase 
the gain on sale of investments in of million was primarily related to the sale of our investment in belden shipholding pte ltd bsh  a company that owns and operates cement carrier vessels 
in november of  we sold our investment in bsh for million pursuant to an unsolicited offer 
in  the gain on sale of investments of  was related to the sale of stock from the portfolio of investments held by our captive insurance company 
investment income increased from million in to million in primarily as a result of higher interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in the overall average balance of funds invested during the full year in loss on early extinguishment of debt of  reported in was due to the retirement of million of our senior notes at a slight premium 
the loss of  reported in was due to the early retirement of one of our loans  offset by the retirement at a slight discount of million of our senior notes 
income taxes in december of  we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under the new tonnage tax regime  which became effective for us on january  primarily because of the changes resulting from the jobs creation act  our federal tax benefit on our loss from continuing operations for varied from the provision that would have been recorded using our statutory federal tax rate of 
we recorded a benefit for federal income taxes of million on our million of income from continuing operations before equity in net income of unconsolidated entities in our effective tax rate of reflects losses in our segments subject to the statutory rate  a tax liability on the shipping income from our foreign subsidiaries offset by a reduction to the valuation allowance on our foreign accumulated deficit  and the result s of our international us flag operations taxed at the lower tonnage tax rate 
we recorded a benefit for federal income taxes of million on our million of income from continuing operations before equity in net income of unconsolidated entities in we would have recognized a tax provision during the period if we were still subject to the statutory rate 
however  income from our subsidiaries whose ships qualify for tonnage tax treatment had an effective tax rate of only for the period  which only slightly offset the tax benefit on the losses generated by a subsidiary whose ships do not qualify for tonnage tax treatment 
this resulted in a tax benefit for a period in which we reported pre tax income 
for a discussion of the jobs creation act and its estimated effect on our results of operations  see note g income taxes of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this form k on page f equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  increased from million in to million in our investment in a company owning two cape size bulk carriers and two panamax size bulk carriers contributed million before taxes in compared to million before taxes in reflecting higher charter rates 
after taxes  this investment contributed million and million during and  respectively  which was net of taxes of  in and million in during  changes in tax regulations resulted in the earnings from this investment being treated as shipping income effective january   which allowed us to utilize our foreign accumulated deficit for which an existing tax valuation allowance was previously recorded 
the earnings from this investment were treated as personal holding income during  and could not offset the for eign accumulated deficit 
our investment in a cement carrier company contributed  before taxes in compared to million before taxes including a pre tax gain of million from our share of the sale of certain vessels in after taxes  this investment contributed  and million during and  respectively  which was net of taxes of  in and  in in the fourth quarter of  we sold our investment in the cement carrier company as discussed earlier 
discontinued operations in  we sold the assets associated with our over the road car transportation truck company 
the decision to sell these assets was primarily the result of a decrease during in the volume of business available to us due to the loss of market share by one of our customers and an industry wide shortage of drivers that caused underutilization of the assets 
the sale of these assets resulted in a net loss before taxes of  losses from operations before taxes were million in the over the road car transportation truck company was reported in the other segment in previous periods 
those periods have been restated to remove the effects of those operations from the other segment to reflect the reclassification from continuing to discontinued operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit decreased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of our segments are discussed below 
liner services gross voyage results for this segment improved slightly from a loss of million in to a loss of million in the improvement was primarily a result of stronger cargo volumes and a more profitable cargo mix for both the foreign flag and us flag lash liner services  partially offset by higher fuel costs on the us flag service  higher vessel operating expenses and unanticipated costs associated with hurricanes katrina and rita 
increases in fuel costs during for our foreign flag lash liner service were substantially covered by fuel surcharges passed on to our customers 
when hurricane katrina struck new orleans in late august of  the ships operating in this service were not located in the gulf of mexico 
after katrina  these ships berthed at lake charles  louisiana  rather than new orleans as an operating focal point 
two of the ships in the liner services were in  or in route to  the port of lake charles when hurricane rita struck that area in september of although the ships safely weathered the impact of the storm  they experienced significant scheduling delays as a result of port and waterway closures 
the costs associated with diverting to lake charles and baton rouge and the delays and other incremental operating costs attributable to the hurricanes were approximately million in operations at our lash barge repair facilities were significantly curtailed as a result of the hurricanes during the year deferring the cost of scheduled maintenance to future periods 
we estimated the net impact of the hurricanes for the liner services in was  time charter contracts the increase in this segment s gross voyage profit from million in to million in was attributable to gross profit from the two container ships acquired in december of  which we simultaneously chartered out  our us flag pctcs carrying higher volumes of supplemental cargoes  which provide revenues in addition to those provided by the time charter agreements  during as compared to  and the addition of our fifth us flag pctc in september of the increase in gross voyage profit was partially offset by a scheduled charterhire rate decrease on one of our pctcs during additionally  the results of our us flag coal carrier were lower than as the vessel  due to market conditions  did not operate as many days beyond its charter obligation  which does not require employment of the vessel for the full year 
contract of affreightment gross voyage profit for this segment decreased from million in to million in due to higher operating expenses  primarily fuel costs  in although the contract for the vessel operating in this segment includes provisions to escalate freight rates based on increases in fuel costs  that rate escalation occurs annually in september 
therefore  operating expenses for periods in which fuel prices increase will be higher for the time before rates escalate 
however  periods in which fuel prices decrease will benefit from the escalation since it is based on the previous year s costs 
rail ferry service gross voyage loss for this segment increased from a loss of million in to a loss of million in this service was forced to cease operations due to the effect of hurricane katrina from the end of august of through november   when we resumed partial operations 
we estimate that revenues lost in  because of the suspension of service  were approximately million and other costs related to the service interruption were approximately  resulting in an estimated direct impact of the hurricane on this service during the year of approximately million 
the service experienced some out of service days before hurricane katrina due to operational delays related to the move of our domestic operations from mobile  alabama  to new orleans  louisiana  that also contributed to the increased losses in compared to other gross voyage profit for this segment decreased slightly from million in to million in other income and expenses the gain on the sale of other assets of  in primarily related to the sale of lash barges no longer needed for current operations 
in  we had no sales of significant assets 
interest expense decreased from million in to million  net of capitalized interest of  in the decrease resulted primarily from early debt repayments in the second half of  repurchase of million of our senior notes in  and regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt  partially offset by higher interest rates in the gain on sale of investment in of  and loss on sale of investment in of  was related to the sale of stock from our portfolio of investments held by our captive insurance company 
investment income increased from  in to million in as a result of an increase in the balance of funds invested in  primarily due to cash proceeds received from the sale of preferred stock completed in january of loss on early extinguishment of debt of  reported in was due to the early retirement of one of our loans  offset by the retirement at a slight discount of million of our senior notes due in the loss of  reported in was due to the early retirement of debt associated with our molten sulphur carrier  as well as the retirement of  of our senior notes at a slight premium 
income taxes in december of  we made an election under the jobs creation act to have our qualifying us flag operations taxed under the new tonnage tax regime  which became effective for us on january  primarily because of the changes resulting from the jobs creation act  our federal tax benefit on our income from continuing operations for  varied significantly from the federal provision that would have been recorded using our statutory federal tax rate of 
in  we recorded a benefit of million on our million of income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities 
we would have recognized a tax provision during the period if we were still subject to the statutory rate 
however  income from our subsidiaries whose ships qualify for tonnage tax treatment had an effective tax rate of only for the period  which only slightly offset the tax benefit on t he losses generated by a subsidiary whose ships do not qualify for tonnage tax treatment 
this resulted in a tax benefit for a period in which we reported pre tax income 
we had a tax benefit for federal income taxes of million on income from continuing operations before income from unconsolidated entities in  which included an addition to net income in the amount of million reflecting a reduction in our net deferred tax provision brought about by the enactment of the jobs creation act during the fourth quarter of passage of this new tax act  and our election in december of for our qualified domestic operations to be taxed under the tonnage tax provision of the new law  rendered certain net deferred tax provisions booked in prior years unnecessary 
equity in net income of unconsolidated entities equity in net income of unconsolidated entities  net of taxes  decreased from million in to million in our investment in a company owning two cape size bulk carriers and two panamax size bulk carriers  contributed million in  net of taxes of million  compared to million  net of million in taxes  in reflecting lower charter rates 
our investment in a cement carrier company contributed million  net of  in taxes  in including a pre tax gain of million from our share of the sale of a cement carrier  compared to  net of  in taxes  in discontinued operations in  we sold the assets associated with our over the road car transportation truck company 
the decision to sell these assets was primarily the result of a decrease during in the volume of business available to us due to the loss of market share by one of our customers and an industry wide shortage of drivers that caused underutilization of the assets 
the sale of these assets resulted in a net loss before taxes of  losses from operations before taxes were million in and  in the over the road car transportation truck company was reported in the other segment in previous periods 
those periods have been restated to remove the effects of those operations from the other segment to reflect the reclassification from continuing to discontinued operations 
liquidity and capital resources the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the more detailed consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere herein as part of our consolidated financial statements 
our working capital decreased from million at december   to million at december   primarily due to the million balance of our senior notes due in october of becoming a current liability in october of  offset by cash proceeds received during the fourth quarter of from asset and investment sales 
cash and cash equivalents increased during by million to a total of million 
this increase was due to cash provided by operating activities of million and by investing activities of million  partially offset by cash used for financing activities of million 
of the million in current liabilities at december   million related to current maturities of long term debt  including million for the senior notes 
operating activities generated positive cash flow after adjusting net income of million for non cash provisions such as depreciation  amortization  impairment loss and gains on sales of assets and investments 
cash provided by operating activities of million also included a decrease in accounts receivable of million primarily due to the timing of collections of receivables from the msc and us department of transportation  offset by an decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million primarily due to the timing of payments for operating expenses and capital improvements accrued at december  that were paid in also included was million of cash used to cover payments for vessel drydocking costs in  offset by cash distributions of million received from our investments in unconsolidated entities and lease incentive obligations related to the relocation of corporate headquarters of million 
cash provided by investing activities of million included proceeds from the sales of assets  our investment in an unconsolidated entity and marketable securities  a return of capital from one of our unconsolidated investments  and the release of million of restricted cash from escrow previously required under an operating lease agreement that now is being satisfied with a letter of credit 
these sources of cash were offset by the use of million of cash for the purchase of a vessel and capital improvements to some of our vessels and our rail ferry service us terminal 
during  the state of louisiana and city of new orleans reimbursed million of the cost of the terminal improvements  some of which were incurred in as of december   the state of louisiana and city of new orleans had fulfilled their obligation to us of million for their portion of the cost of th e new orleans terminal 
cash used for financing activities of million included regularly scheduled debt payments of million  million for repayment of draws on our line of credit  million for the repurchase of some of our senior notes at a small premium  and million for preferred stock dividend payments 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million from draws on our line of credit  the million received from the state of louisiana and city of new orleans mentioned earlier  and proceeds of  from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options 
as of december   million of our million revolving credit facility  which expires in december of  was pledged as collateral for letters of credit 
the remaining million was available as of december  preferred stock offering on january   we announced the completion of our public offering of  shares of convertible exchangeable preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share  or million in total 
the preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum 
the preferred stock is initially convertible into two million shares of our common stock  equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of our common stock and reflecting a conversion premium to the per share closing price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on december  all shares of the preferred stock  which is a new series of our capital stock  were sold 
debt and lease obligations we operate several vessels under operating leases  including three pctcs  a breakbulk multi purpose vessel  a container vessel and a tanker vessel 
we also conduct certain of our operations from leased office facilities and use certain transportation and other equipment under operating leases 
the following is a summary of the scheduled maturities by period of our debt and lease obligations that were outstanding as of december  debt and lease obligations s thereafter long term debt including current maturities interest payments operating leases total by period we are considering various options to repay our outstanding senior notes before they mature in october of those options include repayment with cash available as of december  and cash generated from operating activities and anticipated asset sales during and  if necessary  the use of amounts available under our line of credit 
the table above includes approximately million due in the fourth quarter of on these notes  which was the outstanding balance at december  debt covenant compliance status as of december   we met all of the financial covenants under our various debt agreements  the most restrictive of which include the working capital  leverage ratio  minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio requirements  and believe we will continue to meet these requirements throughout  although we can give no assurance to that effect 
restructuring of liner services and disposition of certain lash assets for the reasons described below  we made a decision in the fourth quarter of to dispose of certain of our lash liner service assets  and we believe we can do so on a basis that will generate cash and a profit on the disposition of the assets  while improving our future operating results 
the liner service segment  which includes the transatlantic lash service and the us flag lash service  generated a gross voyage loss of million in the transatlantic service was affected by a decline in the availability of eastbound cargo throughout the year 
most recently  eastbound shipments were further affected by the european union s embargo on certain shipments of rice from the us  which usually account for a significant portion of our eastbound cargo 
these circumstances have led to our decision to restructure this service 
previously  the transatlantic service utilized two lash vessels  a feeder lash vessel  and a fleet of lash barges 
during september of  we placed one of the lash vessels in a lay up status  resulting in the service operating with one lash vessel  the feeder lash vessel and related barges 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold the lash vessel in lay up along with barges and recognized a gain of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we also entered into a memorandum of agreement to sell our feeder lash vessel along with fifteen lash barges near the end of the first quarter or beginning of the second quarter of  and as of december   the book value of those assets was included in asset held for disposal 
we currently expect to operate our transatlantic service with its remaining assets through the third quarter of as long as firm profitable commitments are in place with shi ppers  and we are planning to sell the remaining assets after the third quarter of the results of the us flag lash service have also been adversely affected by increased operating costs attributable to vessel maintenance and increased fuel cost 
we are considering various options for this service  including continued operations or a possible sale of the lash vessel and related barges 
we currently plan to operate the service as long as we generate a positive cash flow 
total net proceeds from the sales of the assets associated with the restructuring of the transatlantic lash service and estimated proceeds from the possible future sale of the us flag lash service assets in total could range from million to million 
of this amount  we have received million in and would receive the remainder in if we decide to sell the us flag lash service assets 
because our reported book values for these assets are based on historical costs rather than the current market value  we could also recognize gains over that period in excess of million including the million recognized in in addition to generating cash  we believe that restructuring our lash services will improve operating results from that segment  thereby improving our financial performance 
we are actively investigating various investment opportunities to maximize the utilization of the proceeds from the disposition of the lash assets 
throughout  we were evaluating whether to continue to operate our intermodal terminal facility in memphis  tennessee  because the volume of cargo from our lash liner services moving through that facility decreased as the cargo carried by those services declined 
in december of  we terminated the lease of that facility and made a final payment of million in january of rail ferry service expansion this service provides a unique combination of rail and water ferry service between the us gulf and mexico 
the low operating profit margin generated by this service makes higher cargo volumes necessary to achieve meaningful levels of cash flow and profitability 
the capacity of the vessels operating in our rail ferry service defines the maximum revenues and  in turn  the cash flow and gross profits that can be generated by our rail ferry service segment 
therefore  in  we began making capital investments to essentially double the capacity of the service  including the construction of second decks to be added to each of the ships 
also in  the state of louisiana and city of new orleans provided incentives to us to move our us terminal operations from mobile  alabama to new orleans 
we then began making improvements to the us terminal in new orleans necessary to utilize the second decks  which were previously scheduled to be completed and installed by october of we also invested in a transloading and storage facility in new orleans near the terminal and are making improvements to the terminal in mexico 
operations commenced from the new orleans terminal on the mr go in june of with the double ramp necessary to utilize the second decks expected to be completed in october of that year 
as discussed earlier  the effects of hurricane katrina in necessitated the decision to move the us operations back to mobile where a new terminal is under construction 
these events have delayed the completion of the expansion project until the first half of when we expect the ships to be operating with the second deck capacity 
once completed  we believe that this expansion will significantly reduce our cost per unit of cargo carried and significantly increase our cash flow if we are able to book substantially all of the additional capacity 
while we can give no assurance at this time that we will be successful in doing so  we believe that the market will sustain these vessels for the foreseeable future 
we believe that the rail ferry service s strong trade support in and warrants the program expansion 
however  in the event that market conditions change  the vessels could be reassigned to other business subject to retrofitting 
we estimate the total cost of the second decks to be approximately million  and we had incurred approximately million through december  the estimated cost of the mobile terminal is approximately million  of which million will be funded by a grant from the state of alabama 
the remaining million will be financed by the alabama state docks at below market rates and repaid over the ten year terminal lease 
we estimate that our share of the cost of the improvements to the mexican terminal will be approximately million  and we had funded million through december  our investment in the transloading and storage facility was approximately million as of december  the cost of our investment in the transloading and storage facility company in new orleans is reported as an investment in unconsolidated entities of million as of december  as of december   we had also loaned million to that company reported as due from related parties for the long term portion and other current assets for the current portion 
we have a interest in the company that owns the terminal in mexico  and of the advances to that company for our share of the cost of the terminal are accounted for as capital contributions with the remaining accounted for as a loan to that company 
as of december   we had advanced million including  reported as an investment in unconsolidated entities and million reported as due from related parties for the long term portion and other current assets for the current portion 
as discussed earlier  we recorded an impairment loss of million in the second quarter of to write down our net investment in our rail ferry terminal currently located in new orleans  louisiana on the mr go 
that waterway was effectively closed for long term deep draft shipping when congress indefinitely suspended dredging after hurricane katrina 
this resulted in the need for us to relocate the us operations of the rail ferry service to mobile  alabama  which will occur during the second quarter of we have a lease with the port of new orleans for the new orleans terminal 
we are pursuing opportunities to take advantage of our leasehold improvements after the rail ferry service relocates in in this connection  we are actively pursuing a number of alternatives negotiating with the port of new orleans to amend the lease terms to allow other commercial uses of the facility 
having discussions with third parties who may have an interest in utilizing the facility 
closely following and urging congress to pass pending legislation that would call for the federal government to pay mitigating damages to parties that must relocate from the mr go to other locations in the gulf opportunity zone 
on our december  balance sheet  the cost of the new orleans terminal has been written down to the million funded by the state and the city  which is reported in leasehold improvements 
the reimbursements to us from the state and the city are recorded as deferred credits  net of accumulated amortization  under lease incentive obligation for the long term portion and accounts payable and accrued liabilities for the current portion 
the million of leasehold improvements and million of deferred credits are being amortized over the year lease term  which began in the third quarter of  resulting in no net effect on net income after the write down of the leasehold improvements in the second quarter 
if the lease of the new orleans terminal were terminated  there would be no effect on net income because the unamortized leasehold improvements and deferred credits offset each other 
our investment in the new orleans terminal was funded with the proceeds from a financing agreement 
the lender has the ability to utilize certain tax credits associated with profitable operations at that location 
however  if we are not able to operate a profitable service from that location  the lender could lose the associated tax credits  and we could be required to repay the unamortized balance of the loan before its scheduled maturity  which is currently approximately million 
if the lender is then also unable to identify another means of utilizing those tax credits  we could potentially be required to compensate them for the value of those tax credits to them  which is currently approximately million 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund these payments if that should become necessary 
the transloading and storage facility located in new orleans discussed earlier earns substantially all of its revenue from business with our rail ferry service 
therefore  our share of future earnings from that investment will be significantly affected when the rail ferry service moves from new orleans to mobile 
together with the other owner of that company  we are reviewing possible ways to recover that investment including sub letting or selling the property 
we estimate that our share of the current market value of the property will exceed our million investment and the million loan due from that company 
relocation of corporate headquarters in addition to the incentives for relocating our rail ferry service s terminal discussed earlier  the state of alabama and the city and county of mobile have provided incentives totaling million to us to relocate our corporate headquarters from new orleans to mobile 
early in the third quarter of  we entered into a lease for office space in a building currently under construction in mobile that we expect to occupy in the second quarter of as of december   we have received million as an incentive from the lessor of the office building  which has been recorded as a deferred credit on our balance sheet to be amortized over the lease term reducing our lease expenses 
we expect the incentives from the state of alabama and the city and the county of mobile  including the incentive from the lessor of the office building  to offset most of the cash expenditures related to the relocation of the corporate headquarters  including the cost to terminate our existing office leases but excluding the cost of making leasehold improvements to the mobile office  which could be as much as million 
however  our results of operations for the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by approximately million  and we expect our results of operations for to be negatively impacted by approximately million primarily because the revenue associated with the lease incentive of million will be recognized over the year term of the new lease agreement 
dividend payments our preferred stock accrues cash dividends from the date of issuance at a rate of per annum  which are payable quarterly 
the payment of preferred stock dividends is at the discretion of our board of directors 
as a result of our preferred stock offering  we are restricted from paying common stock dividends and acquiring any of our common stock prior to december  environmental issues we have not been notified that we are a potentially responsible party in connection with any environmental matters  and we have determined that we have no known risks for which assertion of a claim is probable that are not covered by third party insurance  provided for in our self retention insurance reserves or otherwise indemnified 
our environmental risks primarily relate to oil pollution from the operation of our vessels 
we have pollution liability insurance coverage with a limit of billion per each occurrence  with a deductible amount of  for each incident

no change to prior periods presented is permitted under the modified prospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  companies record compensation costs for prior periods retroactively through restatement of such periods using the pro forma amounts previously disclosed in the footnotes 
also  in the period of adoption and after  companies record compensation cost based on the modifi ed prospective method 
we have adopted this statement using the modified prospective method 
as permitted by statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and commodity price risk 
we utilize derivative financial instruments including interest rate swap agreements and forward exchange contracts  and in the past we have also utilized commodity swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures 
we hedge only firm commitments or anticipated transactions and do not use derivatives for speculation 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for our investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to our long term debt at december   would be approximately  or of the carrying value 
we entered into three interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  two in september of and another in november of  in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
for each of these agreements  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank 
while these arrangements are structured to reduce our exposure to increases in interest rates  it also limits the benefit we might otherwise receive from any decreases in interest rates 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the amount that the banks would receive or pay to terminate the swap agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current market conditions and interest rates  is an asset of  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates as of december  would have resulted in a  liability 
commodity price risk as of december   we do not have commodity swap agreements in place to manage our exposure to price risk related to the purchase of the estimated fuel requirements for our liner services or rail ferry service segments 
we have fuel surcharges in place for our foreign flag lash liner service and our rail ferry service  which we expect to effectively manage the price risk for those services during if we had commodity swap agreements  they would be structured to reduce our exposure to increases in fuel prices  however  they would also limit the benefit we might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
a hypothetical increase in the price of fuel for the period january  through december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in our fuel costs for the same period  and in a corresponding dec rease of approximately in our earnings per share before taxes based on the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  however  a significant portion of that price increase would have been passed on to our customers through the aforementioned fuel surcharges during the same period 
foreign exchange rate risk we have entered into foreign exchange contracts to hedge certain firm purchase commitments with varying maturities throughout the fair value of these contracts at december   is an asset of  the potential fair value of these contracts that would have resulted from a hypothetical adverse change in the exchange rates applicable to these contracts at december   is an asset of
