item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations include the identification of certain trends and other statements that may predict or anticipate future business or financial results that are subject to important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated 
see item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a national direct marketer of a wide range of it products and services including computer systems  software and peripheral equipment  networking communications  and other products and accessories that we purchase from manufacturers  distributors  and other suppliers 
we also offer a growing range of repair  configuration  installation  and other services performed by our personnel and third party providers 
we operate through three primary business segments a consumers and small to medium sized businesses  or smbs  through our pc connection sales subsidiaries  b large corporate accounts  or large account  through our moredirect subsidiary  and c federal  state  and local government entities and educational institutions  or public sector  through our govconnection subsidiary 
we generate sales through i outbound telemarketing and field sales contacts by account managers focused on the business  education  and government markets  ii our web sites  and iii inbound calls from customers responding to our catalogs and other advertising media 
the primary challenges we face in effectively managing our business are increasing our revenues in the face of increasing competition while improving our gross profit margins in all three business segments  recruiting  retaining  and improving the productivity of our sales personnel  and effectively managing and leveraging our selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses over a higher sales base 
with only moderate growth projected in the overall it industry  any significant sales growth for us must come through increased market share 
competition is expected to be even more intense in the future  which could put more pressure on margins 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated information derived from our statements of income expressed as a percentage of net sales 
years ended december  net sales in millions net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses special charges income from operations all three of our business segments experienced year over year sales growth in although our public sector sales increased only slightly in compared to  our large account and smb segments sales increased by and  respectively 
our large account segment benefited from organic growth as well as from sales generated by former amherst service and sales representatives who joined our organization in october our smb segment increased net sales in by adding new customers and penetrating existing accounts 

table of contents sales distribution the following table sets forth our percentage of net sales by business segment and product mix years ended december  business segment smb large account public sector total product mix notebooks and pdas desktop servers storage devices software net com products printers and printer supplies video  imaging  and sound memory and system enhancements accessories other total gross profit margins the following table summarizes our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of net sales  for the last three years years ended december  segment smb large account public sector total consolidated gross profit dollars increased in by million compared to due to increases in both net sales and gross profit margins 
gross margin improvement in resulted from higher customer invoice product margins  increased sales of higher margin services and software  larger net sales from software referral and other agency fees  and increased vendor consideration recorded as an offset to cost of sales 
cost of sales and certain other costs cost of sales includes the invoice cost of the product  direct costs of packaging  inbound and outbound freight  and provisions for inventory obsolescence  adjusted for discounts  rebates  and other vendor allowances  including those pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
direct operating expenses relating to our purchasing function and receiving  inspection  internal transfer  warehousing  packing and shipping  and other operating expenses of our distribution center are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
accordingly  our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other entities who include all of the operating costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold 
such costs  as a percentage of net sales for the years reported  are as follows years ended december  
table of contents operating expenses the following table breaks out our more significant operating expenses for the last three years in millions of dollars years ended december  personnel costs advertising  net facilities operations credit card fees depreciation and amortization professional fees bad debts other net total percentage of net sales we have concentrated our efforts on managing our overall operating costs 
while we plan to continue our focus on controlling discretionary expenditures  we expect that our sg a expense may vary depending on changes in sales volume  as well as the levels of continued investments in key growth initiatives such as enhancing our sales training  improving marketing programs  and deploying next generation technology to support the sales organization 
personnel costs continue to represent the majority of our operating expenses  with sales personnel representing the largest portion of these costs 
the year over year increase in personnel costs resulted primarily from additional sales and service personnel from our amherst transaction  increased variable compensation related to higher gross profits  and additional staffing at our texas call center  which opened in march our other operating costs  except for credit card fees and bad debts  tend to be relatively fixed over changing sales levels 
the increase in other costs is attributable primarily to increases in professional fees and in non income based state tax and other compliance accruals 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in the catalogs for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expenses 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are classified as offsets to cost of sales or inventory in accordance with eitf issue no 
gross advertising and marketing allowances received from vendors were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we classified million  million  and million of these allowances as offsets to cost of sales or inventory for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our net advertising expense  included in sg a  has been accordingly higher in each successive year 

table of contents year over year comparisons year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  million in from  million in due to increases in all three business segments 
changes in net sales and gross profit by business segment are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales change sales smb large account public sector total gross profit smb large account public sector total net sales for our smb segment benefited from an increase in sales representatives employed in sales representatives for the smb segment totaled at december   up from at december  sales growth was impacted by a slight decline in consumer sales  as lower inbound telephone sales were offset partially by higher internet consumer sales 
these changes reflect a reduction in the number of catalogs we distributed and an increased focus and spending on more diverse marketing strategies and programs designed to reach our business customers 
also impacting sales growth in was an increased focus on more profitable sales compared to average annualized sales productivity in decreased by compared to in the smb segment  primarily due to the additional number of new hires added at our texas call center  which opened in march net sales for our large account segment increased due to improvement in sales representative productivity and as a result of the amherst transaction 
our net sales benefited from a full year of revenues generated by former amherst sales representatives who joined this segment in the last quarter of sales representatives for our large account segment totaled at december   down from at the end of average annualized productivity for this segment s sales representatives improved due to increased sales to existing customers  the addition of new accounts  and a decrease in headcount of sales representatives 
net sales for our public sector segment increased slightly year over year due to management s focus on higher margin sales opportunities in compared to average annualized sales productivity in was unchanged year over year as both net sales and total sales representatives increased slightly compared to sales representatives for our public sector segment totaled at december   up from at december  gross profit increased in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales in all three business segments as shown by the above 
the basis point increase in gross margin for our smb segment resulted from increased focus on achieving higher customer invoice margins  as well as increased vendor consideration recorded as an offset to cost of sales

we believe that as our texas sales representatives productivity increases  sg a as a percentage of sales will decrease in future periods 
we invest considerable resources in our training of new and existing sales representatives and expect new sales representatives to be a net expense for their first twelve months of employment 
the increased management bonuses in resulted from our improved results achieved in compared to the prior year 
sg a expenses for our large account segment increased year over year in both dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
these increases resulted largely from the additional sales and service representatives added from our amherst transaction and increased variable compensation associated with higher gross profits

sales representatives for the smb segment totaled at december   up from at december  net sales for our smb segment also increased due to the implementation of customer acquisition initiatives  including increased internet advertising  which contributed to our year over year increase in smb internet sales in net sales for our large account segment increased due to an improvement in average sales productivity per account manager and as a result of our amherst transaction 
our fourth quarter sales of included million of revenues generated by former amherst sales representatives who joined this segment 
sales representatives for the large account segment totaled at december   up from at the end of this segment s productivity increase resulted from increased penetration of our existing customer base  as well as the addition of new accounts 
net sales for our public sector segment increased due to a year over year increase in our federal government revenues  as our sales to state and local government units and educational organizations were level year over year 
during the year ended december   we added several new vendors to our gsa contract  which was awarded in the third quarter of and therefore not in effect for most of the prior year 
sales representatives for our public sector segment totaled at december  and gross profit increased in all three business segments as shown by the above  whereas the gross margin percentage of net sales improved for our smb and public sector segments 
gross profit for our smb segment increased primarily due to a refinement of estimates  made in the third quarter of  pursuant to eitf  which required the transfer of additional vendor consideration from sg a to cost of sales 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of additional vendor consideration as a reduction to cost of sales  compared to million in these offsets resulted in gross margin increases of and of net sales for and  respectively 
gross margins were otherwise negatively impacted by increased shipping costs and tighter competitive pricing pressures  which partly offset the increased vendor consideration 
gross profit for our large account segment increased due to an increase in sales as explained above 
gross margin rates decreased modestly in this highly competitive large enterprise segment 
we targeted a select group of high value customers in the latter half of  which partly accounted for the sales increase but also adversely impacted gross margin rates

income from operations decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million compared to moredirect  our large account segment  accounted for million and million of our income from operations in and  respectively 
excluding moredirect  we incurred a loss from operations of million for and million for  primarily as the result of the losses incurred in our public sector segment and the lower gross margin in our smb segment  after excluding the effect of eitf income from operations as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in this decrease was attributable to the changes in net sales  gross margin  and sg a expenses as discussed above 
interest expense was million in both and interest expense was unchanged in as higher interest rates in were offset by lower borrowings as compared to our effective tax rate was for and for this year over year increase was due primarily to the tax benefits of state tax loss carryforwards in certain jurisdictions not recognizable as offsets to state tax charges in other jurisdictions  and to certain non deductible expenses 
net income decreased by million to million in from million in  principally as a result of the decrease in income from operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources liquidity overview our primary sources of liquidity have historically been internally generated funds from operations and borrowings under our bank line of credit 
we have used those funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of working capital for operational needs  capital expenditures for computer equipment and software used in our business  and in our amherst transaction 
we believe that funds generated from operations  together with available credit under our bank line of credit and inventory trade credit agreements  will be sufficient to finance our working capital  capital expenditure  and other requirements for at least the next twelve calendar months 
we expect our capital needs for to consist primarily of capital expenditures of to million and payments on capital and contractual obligations of approximately million 
we expect to meet our cash requirements for through a combination of cash on hand  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  borrowings on our bank line of credit  as follows cash on hand 
at december   we had approximately million in unrestricted accounts 
cash generated from operations 
we expect to generate cash flows from operations in excess of operating cash needs by generating earnings and balancing net changes in inventories and receivables with compensating changes in payables to generate a positive cash flow 
historically  we have consistently generated positive cash flows from operations 
credit facilities 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding against our million bank line of credit 
this line of credit can be increased  at our option  to million for approved acquisitions or other uses authorized by the bank 
borrowings are  however  limited by certain minimum collateral and earnings requirements  as described more fully below 
our ability to continue funding our planned growth  both internally and externally  is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  or from other sources of financing  as may be required 
while at this time we do not anticipate needing any additional sources of financing to fund our operations  if demand for it products declines  our cash flows from operations may be substantially affected

summary sources and uses of cash the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the last three years in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for provided by financing activities increase in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities increased in compared to the prior years 
operating cash flow in resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and a decrease in inventory  offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable 
inventory decreased by million in partly as a result of our increased utilization of supplier drop shipments to customers 
we drop shipped approximately of net sales in  compared to in  and as a result  we were able to maintain lower inventory levels in accordingly  inventory days improved to days at december   compared to days at december  accounts receivable increased by million in from the prior year end level due to higher net sales in days sales outstanding improved to days at december   compared to days at december  due to improved collection efforts

table of contents resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and an increase in accounts payable  offset partially by an increase in accounts receivable 
cash flow from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net income before depreciation and a decrease in accounts receivable  offset partially by a decrease in accounts payable 
at december   we had million in outstanding accounts payable 
such accounts are generally paid within days of incurrence  except for accounts providing for discounts for early payments 
such payments will be financed by cash flows from operations or short term borrowings under the line of credit 
this amount includes million payable to two financial institutions under inventory trade credit agreements we use to finance our purchase of certain inventory  secured by the inventory so financed 
we believe we will be able to meet our obligations under our accounts payable with cash flows from operations and our existing line of credit 
cash used for investing activities decreased in compared to these activities include our capital expenditures in the three years presented  primarily for computer equipment and capitalized internally developed software 
our acquisition of moredirect required earn out payments due to the former shareholder of moredirect 
these payments totaled million and million in and  respectively 
additionally  in we completed the amherst transaction  which accounted for million of the use of cash in cash used for financing activities in related to a pay down in our net borrowings of million under our bank line of credit  whereas there was an increase in our net borrowings of million in this paydown was partially offset by proceeds of million from option exercises in our financing activities consisted primarily of a paydown in net borrowings of million 
debt instruments  contractual agreements  and related covenants below is a summary of certain provisions of our credit facilities and other contractual obligations 
for more information about the restrictive covenants in our debt instruments and inventory financing agreements  see factors affecting sources of liquidity 
for more information about our obligations  commitments  and contingencies  see our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this annual report 
bank line of credit 
our bank line of credit provides us with a borrowing capacity of up to million 
in addition  we have the option to increase the facility an additional million  based on sufficient levels of trade receivables to meet borrowing base requirements  and depending on meeting minimum ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization and equity requirements  described below under factors affecting sources of liquidity 
no borrowings were outstanding under this facility at december  substantially all of our assets are collateralized as security for this facility  and all of our subsidiaries are guarantors under the line of credit 
at december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
this facility  which matures in june  operates under an automatic cash management program whereby disbursements in excess of available cash are added as borrowings at the time disbursement checks clear the bank  and available cash receipts are first applied against any outstanding borrowings and then invested in short term qualified cash investments 
accordingly  borrowings under the line are classified as current 
inventory trade credit agreements 
we have security agreements with two financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of inventory from various suppliers under certain terms and conditions 
these agreements allow a collateralized first position in certain branded products inventory financed by these financial institutions 
although the agreements provide for up to financing on the purchase price  up to an aggregate of million  any outstanding financing must be fully secured by available inventory 
we do not pay any interest or discount fees on such inventory financing  such costs are borne by the suppliers as an incentive for us to purchase 
table of contents their products 
amounts outstanding under such facilities  equal to million as of december   are recorded in accounts payable  and the inventory financed is classified as inventory on the consolidated balance sheet 
contractual obligations 
during we signed a lease agreement for our new texas sales office

we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
capital leases 
we have a fifteen year lease for our corporate headquarters with an affiliated company related through common ownership 
we also have a three year lease for certain computer equipment with an unrelated party 
we are required to make lease payments aggregating from million to million per year 
in addition to the rent payable under the facility lease  we are required to pay real estate taxes  insurance  and common area maintenance charges 
operating leases 
we also lease facilities from our principal stockholders and facilities and equipment from third parties under non cancelable operating leases 
see contractual obligations above for lease commitments under these leases 
sports marketing commitments 
we have entered into multi year sponsorship agreements with the boston red sox and the new england patriots that extend to and  respectively 
these agreements  which grant us various marketing rights and seating arrangements  require annual payments aggregating from million to million per year 
earn out provisions of moredirect merger agreement 
we completed the acquisition of moredirect in april under the terms of this agreement  we were required to make additional payments to the moredirect shareholder if certain earnings levels were achieved through december  earn out payments aggregating million and million were made in and  respectively  based on moredirect s earnings for and  respectively 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are our ability to minimize costs and fully achieve our operating efficiencies  timely collection of our customer receivables  and management of our inventory levels 
bank line of credit 
our credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operational covenants and other restrictions including restrictions on additional debt  guarantees  stock repurchases  dividends and other 
table of contents distributions  investments  and liens with which the company and all of its subsidiaries must comply 
any failure to comply with these covenants would not only prevent us from borrowing additional funds under this line of credit  but would also constitute a default 
this credit facility contains two financial tests the funded debt ratio defined as the average outstanding advances under the line for the quarter  divided by the consolidated ebitda for the trailing four quarters must not be more than to our actual funded debt ratio at december  was to minimum consolidated net worth must be at least million  plus of consolidated net income for each quarter  beginning with the quarter ended march  loss quarters not counted 
such amount was calculated at december  as million  whereas our actual consolidated stockholders equity at this date was million 
the borrowing base under this facility is set at of qualified commercial receivables  plus of qualified government receivables  less million of the formula availability which must be held in reserves 
as of december   the entire million facility was available for borrowing 
inventory trade credit agreements 
these agreements contain similar financial ratios and operational covenants and restrictions as those contained in our bank line of credit described above 
such agreements also contain cross default provisions whereby a default under the bank agreement would also constitute a default under these agreements 
financing under these agreements is limited to the purchase of specific branded products from authorized suppliers  and amounts outstanding must be fully collateralized by inventories of those products on hand 
capital markets 
our ability to raise additional funds in the capital market depends upon  among other things  general economic conditions  the condition of the information technology industry  our financial performance and stock price  and the state of the capital markets 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the sec requires that all registrants disclose their most critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy has been defined as one that is both important to the portrayal of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
further  critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies described below fit the definition of critical accounting policies 
we have reviewed our policies for the year ended december  and determined that they remain our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized at the point in time when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and final  delivery has occurred  and there is a reasonable assurance of collection of the sales proceeds 
we generally obtain oral or written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
because we either i have a general practice of covering customer losses while products are in transit despite title transferring to the customer at the point of shipment or ii have fob destination specifically set out in our arrangements with federal agencies  delivery is deemed to have occurred at the point in time when the product is received by the customer 
we provide our customers with a limited thirty day right of return generally limited to defective merchandise 
revenue is recognized at delivery and a reserve for sales returns is recorded 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  based on significant historical experience 
should such returns no 
table of contents longer prove estimable  we believe the impact on our financials would not necessarily be significant  since the return privilege expires days after shipment 
revenue for third party service contracts are recorded on a net sales recognition basis because we do not assume the risks and rewards of ownership in these transactions 
for such contracts  we evaluate whether the sales of such services should be recorded as gross sales or net sales as required under the guidelines described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
under gross sales recognition  we are the primary obligor  and the entire selling process is recorded in sales with our cost to the third party service provider recorded as a cost of sales 
under net sales recognition  we are not the primary obligor  and the cost to the third party service provider is recorded as a reduction to sales  with no cost of goods sold  thus leaving the entire gross profit as the reported net sale for the transaction 
similarly  we recognize revenue from agency sales transactions on a net sales basis 
in agency sales transactions  we facilitate product and software sales by manufacturers directly to our customers and receive agency  or referral  fees for such transactions 
we do not take title to the products or assume any maintenance or return obligations in these transactions  title is passed directly from the supplier to our customer 
net amounts included in revenue for such service contracts and agency sales transactions were million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers current creditworthiness 
our allowance is generally computed by applying specific percentage reserves on accounts that are past due  and specifically reserving for customers known to be in financial difficulty 
therefore  if the financial condition of certain of our customers were to deteriorate  or if we noted there was a lengthening of the timing of the settlement of receivables that was symptomatic of a general deterioration in the ability of our customers to pay  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
this would negatively impact our earnings 
our cash flows would be impacted to the extent that receivables could not be collected 
in addition to accounts receivable from customers  we record receivables from our vendors suppliers for cooperative advertising  price protection  supplier reimbursements  rebates  and other similar arrangements 
a portion of such receivables is estimated based on information available from our vendors at discrete points in time 
while such estimates have historically approximated actual cash received  an unanticipated change in a promotional program could give rise to a reduction in the receivable 
this could negatively impact our earnings and our cash flows 
considerable judgment is used in assessing the ultimate realization of customer receivables and vendor supplier receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of a customer  vendor information  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluations are incorrect  we may incur future charges to our income statement 
vendor consideration we receive allowances from merchandise vendors for price protections  discounts  product rebates  and other programs 
these allowances are treated as a reduction of the vendor s prices and are recorded as adjustments to cost of sales or inventory  as applicable 
we also receive vendor co op advertising funding for our catalogs and other programs 
vendors have the ability to place advertisements in the catalogs for which we receive advertising allowances 
these vendor allowances  to the extent that they represent specific reimbursements of the underlying incremental and identifiable costs  are offset against sg a expense on the consolidated statements of income 
advertising allowances that cannot be associated with a specific program 
table of contents funded by an individual vendor or that exceed the fair value of advertising expense associated with that program are recorded as reductions to cost of inventory purchases in accordance with eitf the level of allowances received from certain merchandise vendors has declined in past years and may do so again 
such a decline could have a material impact on gross margin and operating income 
inventories merchandise inventories all finished goods consisting of software packages  computer systems  peripheral equipment  and consumer electronics are stated at cost determined under the first in  first out method or market  whichever is lower 
inventory quantities on hand are reviewed regularly  and provisions are made for obsolete  slow moving  and non salable inventory  based primarily on management s forecast of customer demand for those products in inventory 
the it industry is characterized by rapid technological change and new product development that could result in increased obsolescence of inventory on hand 
increased obsolescence or decreased customer demand beyond management s expectations could require additional provisions 
this could negatively impact our earnings 
our obsolescence charges have historically ranged between million and million per annum 
historically  there have been no unusual charges precipitated by specific technological or forecast issues 
contingencies from time to time we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we are also subject to audits by states on sales and income taxes  unclaimed property  and other assessments 
a multi state unclaimed property audit is in progress  and certain sales tax audits may be imminent 
while management believes that known liabilities have been adequately provided for  it is too early to determine the ultimate outcome of such audits 
such outcome could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
value of long lived assets  including intangibles we carry a variety of long lived assets on our balance sheet 
these are all currently classified as held for use 
these include property and equipment  identifiable intangibles  and goodwill 
an impairment review is undertaken on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and on an event driven basis for all long lived assets including indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows emanating from such assets may be diminished 
we may review the carrying value of all these assets based partly on our projections of anticipated cash flows projections which are  in part  dependent upon anticipated market conditions  operational performance  and legal status 
any impairment charge that is recorded negatively impacts our earnings 
cash flows are generally not impacted 
over the last several years  we have incurred no impairment charges 
while we believe that our future estimates are reasonable  different assumptions regarding items such as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve could materially effect our valuations and result in impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets 
employee compensation and benefits our employee compensation model has several elements that we consider variable 
these include our obligation to our employees for health care 
we have selected a plan that results in our being self insured up to certain stop loss limits 
accordingly  we have to estimate the amount of health care claims outstanding at a given point in time 
these estimates are based on historical experience and could be subject to change 
such change could negatively impact both our earnings and our cash flows 
we have also engaged in workforce reduction actions in each of the last three years 
these actions included formula driven termination benefits 
these benefits were or are being paid relatively quickly and have not been 
table of contents subject to change 
we do not foresee a circumstance where there could be significant variability in our workforce reduction estimates 
however  if we did experience significant variability  such change could negatively impact our cash flows 
share based compensation prior to january   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
the intrinsic value method requires that compensation expense be measured by the difference between the fair value of our common stock and the strike price of the option as of a measurement date 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
sfas r requires a company to measure the grant date fair value of equity awards given to employees and recognize that cost  adjusted for forfeitures  over the period that such services are performed in its consolidated financial statements described in note 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures experienced differ from these estimates 
under the modified prospective application method  financial results for the prior periods have not been adjusted 
we have used the criteria in sfas no 
r to calculate and establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation 
recently issued financial accounting standards in june the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which will become effective for our financial statements on january  the interpretation prescribes a minimum recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on accounting for derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently estimate our adoption of fin will result in a cumulative effect adjustment that will decrease retained earnings as of january  by an amount not to exceed million 
in june the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
this issue addresses the presentation in the income statement of taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities including but not limited to sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
eitf is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  we present our revenue net of sales taxes  and expect to continue to do so in the future 
accordingly  the adoption of eitf will not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in september the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on the financial statements and related disclosures 
sab is effective for annual financial statements for the year ended december  sab did not have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
in september the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 

table of contents in february the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas sfas which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operation or financial position 
inflation we have historically offset any inflation in operating costs by a combination of increased productivity and price increases  where appropriate 
we do not expect inflation to have a significant impact on our business in the foreseeable future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
in addition  our unsecured credit agreement provides for borrowings which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime rate 
we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows should not be material 
our credit agreement exposes earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
no borrowings were outstanding pursuant to the credit agreement as of december   however  our average outstanding borrowing during was million 
accordingly  the change in earnings resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material
