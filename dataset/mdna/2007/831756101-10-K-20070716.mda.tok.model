this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview highlights our fiscal net product and services sales of approximately million represented an increase of over fiscal sales in our firearms core business increased by to approximately million 
net income for fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal net income 
a number of initiatives that took place in fiscal contributed to this improvement in results  including the following we acquired thompson center arms on january  as part of our initiative to enter the long gun market  a market that is larger than the handgun market 
in the four months that we owned this company in fiscal  it contributed approximately million in sales  with approximately million in firearms 
our m p series of pistols has been in production for just over one year and has had more than an win rate for all law enforcement test and evaluations in which it has participated 
similarly  our m p tactical rifle has won over of all law enforcement test and evaluations in which it has participated 
in its first full year of sales  this rifle has been selected or approved by law enforcement agencies as a duty weapon 
our regional employee based sporting goods sales force has been in effect for a full year with favorable results 
our sporting goods channel increased by for fiscal  excluding the thompson center arms acquisition  with continued growth each quarter since implementation of this sales force in replacement of independent manufacturers representatives 
we invested over million in machinery and equipment  with most of the investment related to the expansion of our pistol business 
pistols represent about of the domestic handgun market  and our pistol sales grew by in fiscal restatement sec inquiry in august  we amended various reports previously filed with the sec to modify certain accounting matters related to our acquisition of smith wesson corp 
we restated our form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  as well as our form qsb reports for the quarters ended july  and  october  and  and january  and the form ksb report for the fiscal year ended april  was filed in december and included restated financial statements for fiscal the amended form qsb reports for the july and october quarters were filed in january  and the amended form qsb reports for the january quarters were filed in march the sec is conducting an informal inquiry regarding the circumstances surrounding the restatement 
we are cooperating fully with the sec in this inquiry 
the inquiry is still ongoing 
management objectives in fiscal  we added several new senior managers to our company  including a new chief executive officer in december the new management team has been assessing our business  including conducting extensive market research about the smith wesson brand  the firearms market  and our competitors 
our research determined that the smith wesson brand stands for safety  security  protection  and sport 
our management team decided to focus its strategy around these four items 
all future ventures and licensing opportunities will fit under the umbrella of safety  security  protection  and sport 
it is our view that opportunities for our company extend 
table of contents beyond firearms 
this belief is supported by brand research that has identified several areas in which the smith wesson brand has a strong recognition with prospective buyers 
while we will continue to focus on firearms  with an increased emphasis on the military and law enforcement markets  we will also look beyond firearms using safety  security  protection  and sport as the guide for determining business expansion 
our business we are the largest handgun manufacturer in the united states 
we offer one of the broadest lines of handguns in the industry 
our product line consists of both revolvers and pistols 
we entered the long gun market in fiscal with the introduction of the m p rifle 
in fiscal  we continued to expand our product offerings in the long gun market with the acquisition of thompson center arms  the introduction of a line of smith wesson shotguns  and the introduction of a smith wesson bolt action rifle 
we are also one of the largest manufacturers of handcuffs and restraints in the united states 
key performance indicators we evaluate the performance of our business based upon operating profit  which includes net sales  cost of sales  selling and administrative expenses  and certain components of other income and expense 
we also use ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to evaluate our performance 
we evaluate our various product lines by such measurements as cost per unit produced  units produced per day  and incoming orders per day 
key industry data the handgun market in the united states has remained relatively constant over the past years 
handguns have been subject to legislative actions in the past  and the market has reacted to these actions 
there was a substantial increase in sales in the early s during the period leading up to and shortly after the enactment of the brady bill 
in the period from through  the us handgun market increased by over  as consumers purchased handguns in fear of prohibition of handgun ownership 
the market levels returned to pre levels and have remained relatively unchanged 
within the us handgun market  approximately of the market is pistols and is revolvers 
we are the largest manufacturer of revolvers and pistols in the united states 
there is very limited market data available on the firearms industry 
federal excise tax collections represent the best measurement of us market share 
the us government issues this information on a quarterly basis 
by comparing our tax payment to the reported collection  we can estimate our market share 
based upon the most recent data  we believe that we have approximately a share of the us consumer market for handguns 
this compares with in the period just before we acquired smith wesson corp 
in it also compares favorably with market share figures of the s when we had an estimated market share

we also received a refund of  in industry dues 
interest income the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest income for the fiscal years ended april    and change change 
table of contents interest income of  for fiscal increased by  over fiscal levels 
this increase was attributable to a higher cash balance on hand  primarily in december to january when we had  in proceeds from the convertible debt offering before completing the acquisition of thompson center arms 
interest income of  for fiscal represented a decline of  from fiscal levels as a result of a refinancing that occurred in january approximately million in cash was held as collateral for our debt prior to the january refinancing 
this cash was used to repay debt as part of the refinancing 
interest expense the following table sets forth certain information regarding interest expense for the fiscal years ended april    and change change interest expense increased by  for fiscal as a result of the additional debt incurred in fiscal to acquire thompson center arms 
in december  we completed an  convertible debt offering to provide funds for the thompson center arms acquisition 
we also borrowed  against our acquisition line of credit with td banknorth in january to fund the balance of the acquisition cost 
interest expense declined by  for fiscal as a result of the refinancing that was completed in january income taxes the following table sets forth certain information regarding income tax expense for the fiscal years ended april    and change change our income tax expense for fiscal was  compared with an income tax expense of  for fiscal and  for fiscal the tax provision for fiscal included the effect of a federal and state deferred tax rate change of  the tax provision for fiscal included a  adjustment resulting from the write off of an internal revenue code section limitation to our federal net operating loss carryforward of  and  of tax expense related to tax adjustments on exercises of employee stock options under sfas r 
our income tax expense includes deferred income taxes arising from temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and net operating loss carryforwards 
these amounts are reflected in the balance of our net deferred tax assets  which totaled approximately million  before valuation allowance  as well as net deferred tax liabilities  which totaled approximately million at april  net tax assets liabilities changed substantially during the year ended april  the change occurred primarily as a result of the acquisition of thompson center arms in january as required by fasb statement no 
 we recorded tax assets or liabilities for the temporary differences between book value and tax bases in assets and liabilities on the purchase date 
in assessing the realization of our deferred income tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets depends upon generating future taxable income during the periods in which our temporary differences become deductible and before our net operating loss carryforwards expire 
we evaluate the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets by assessing the need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets will not be recovered  a valuation allowance will be established against some or all of our deferred income tax assets 
recording a valuation allowance or reversing a valuation allowance could have a significant effect on our future results of operations and financial position 

table of contents a valuation allowance of approximately  was provided on our deferred federal tax assets for a capital loss carryforward  which we do not anticipate using prior to its expiration 
no other valuation allowance was provided on our deferred federal income tax assets as of april    or  as we believe that it is more likely than not that all such assets will be realized 
in addition  we maintained a valuation allowance of approximately  and  against our state deferred tax assets as of april  and  respectively 
this valuation allowance specifically relates to state net operating loss carryforwards 
there is uncertainty related to the recognition of the benefit attributable to these state net operating losses 
we reached these conclusions after considering both changes in our business as well as the availability of taxable income in prior carryback years  tax planning strategies  and the likelihood of generating future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
differences between forecasted and actual future operating results could adversely impact our ability to realize our deferred tax assets 
we had federal net operating loss carryforwards amounting to million  million  and million as of april   and  respectively 
the net operating loss carryforward at april  expires in fiscal years and internal revenue code section limits utilization of these losses to  per year 
effective april   it was determined that  of net operating loss carryforwards will expire unutilized 
therefore  the related deferred tax asset of  was reversed to tax expense in fiscal it is possible that future substantial changes in our ownership could occur that could result in additional ownership changes pursuant to internal revenue code section if such an ownership change were to occur  there would be an annual limitation on the remaining tax loss carryforwards that can be utilized 
federal net operating losses account for million of the total net deferred tax liability of million and million of the million of net deferred tax assets as of april  and  respectively 
state net operating loss carryforwards amounted to million and million as of april   and  respectively 
there are no state net operating loss carryforwards at the end of fiscal on october   the american jobs creation act  or ajca was signed into law 
the ajca provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activity  or qpa  which will be phased in from through pursuant to fasb staff position no 
 application of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  to the tax deduction on qualified production activity provided by the ajca of  the effect of this deduction is reported in the period in which it is claimed on our tax return 
the qpa benefit for us will be approximately  in fiscal and resulted in the reduction of tax expense of  in fiscal no benefit was available in fiscal or because we had no taxable income due to operating loss carryforwards 
the annual deduction for the remaining federal net operating loss carryforward is so limited by internal revenue code section that the unfavorable impact on the future benefits of the qpa should be negligible 
in return for the qpa  the ajca provides for a two year transition from the existing extraterritorial income exclusion  or eti  tax benefit for foreign sales  which the world trade organization  or wto  ruled was an illegal export subsidy 
the eti benefit will be fully phased out for us after fiscal the eti benefit for us was approximately  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
net income the following table sets forth certain information regarding net income and the related per share data for the fiscal years ended april    and change change net income net income per share basic diluted the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal was attributable to a increase in sales as well as improvements in gross profit and operating income margins resulting from controlled spending 
the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal was attributable to a increase in sales  the 
table of contents  benefit from the reduction in environmental reserves  and a  reduction in interest expense driven by the refinancing that took place in january fiscal results also reflected the million benefit of an agreement reached with one of our insurance carriers  which included a net cash refund of approximately million 
the increase in net income and net income per share for fiscal resulted primarily from a reduction in operating expenses 
liquidity and capital resources our principal cash requirements are to finance the growth of our firearms and other operations and to service our existing debt 
capital expenditures for new products  capacity expansion  and process improvements represent important cash needs 
the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the fiscal years ended april    and change change operating activities investing activities financing activities total excluding the cash activity relating to the thompson center arms acquisition  operating activities represent the principal source of our cash flow 
cash flow from operating activities increased by  for fiscal over fiscal levels 
the improvement in operating cash flow for fiscal was attributable to improved profitability partially offset by a larger increase in working capital in fiscal than was realized in fiscal accounts receivable increased  in fiscal  of which million related to increased activity at thompson center arms since the january  acquisition date and the remaining million due to record fourth quarter sales in the springfield and houlton facilities 
sales for the quarter  excluding thompson center arms  were million  million higher than for the similar period last year 
non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization and deferred taxes  had a significant impact on fiscal results 
depreciation and amortization increased by  as a result of increased capital spending and acquisition related intangible assets while net deferred taxes liability decreased by  primarily resulting from the book deduction of acquisition related assets that are not tax deductible and significant changes in reserves that represent timing difference for tax purposes 
for fiscal  cash flow from operating activities increased by  over fiscal levels 
the improvement in operating cash flow for fiscal was attributable to improved profitability  which was further enhanced by our use of tax loss carryforwards 
non cash expenses  such as depreciation and stock based compensation expense  also had a significant impact on fiscal results 
depreciation and amortization increased by  while stock based compensation expense increased by  the substantial increase in accounts receivable at april  reflected record sales in the month of april sales for the month were million  million higher than for april in addition  the receivable from insurance carriers reported in other assets was reduced by  to reflect the dismissal of cases and corresponding reduction in potential liability related to those claims 
excluding the  used to acquire thompson center arms  cash used for investing activities totaled  a  reduction in cash used from fiscal usage primarily due to the  received from the springfield redevelopment authority as part of the final payment on acres of land sold to them in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal were  cash used for investing activities totaled  for fiscal compared with  provided by investing activities for fiscal  a decrease of  capital expenditures were  for fiscal compared with  for fiscal in fiscal  collateralized cash deposits totaling  were used to repay debt as part of the refinancing that was completed in january 
table of contents cash generated by financing activities for fiscal included million in convertible debt and million to finance the acquisition of thompson center arms and was partially offset by  in debt financing costs 
cash generated by financing activities totaled  for fiscal compared with cash used by financing activities of  for fiscal  an improvement of  in fiscal  we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock in a private equity placement 
the proceeds from that sale were  the proceeds from this sale were used to repurchase  common stock warrants from two former officers of our company at a cost  proceeds from the exercise of common stock and warrants totaled  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal in fiscal  we completed a refinancing that resulted in our repaying a million note to tomkins corporation with a combination of collateralized cash deposits and the proceeds from an million note we obtained from td banknorth na at april   we had open letters of credit aggregating at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand 
we have a  revolving line of credit with td banknorth and a  revolving line of credit with citizens bank  there were no outstanding balances on either line as of april  based upon our current working capital position  current operating plans and expected business conditions  we believe that our existing capital resources and credit facilities will be adequate to fund our operations  including our outstanding debt and other commitments  for the next months 
other matters inflation we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on us during fiscal   or critical accounting policies use of estimates in preparation of financial statements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
operating results in the future could vary from the amounts derived from these estimates and assumptions 
in addition  future facts and circumstances could alter our estimates with respect to the adequacy of insurance reserves 
the more significant estimates and assumptions used by the us in the preparation of the financial statements relate to the reserves established for uncollectible accounts receivable  obsolete and slow moving inventory  and certain accrued liabilities  including product  environmental  and warranty liabilities and workers compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product sales account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
we recognize revenue from product sales when the earnings process is complete and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which is generally upon shipment 
we also provide tooling  forging  heat treating  finishing  plating  and engineering support services to customers  we recognize these revenues when accepted by the customer  when no further contingencies or material performance obligations exist  and when collectibility is reasonably assured  thereby earning us the right to receive and retain payments for services performed and billed 
we recognize trademark licensing revenues for all individual licensees on a quarterly basis based on actual receipts from licensees 
this revenue consists of minimum royalties and or a percentage of a licensee s sales on licensed products 
under our current licensing agreements  these revenues are payable on a calendar quarter basis 
we recognize fees received upon initial signing of license agreements as revenues where no future obligation is required on our part 
as a result of a combination of uncertain factors regarding existing licensees  including current 
table of contents and past payment performance  market acceptance of the licensee s product and insufficient historical experience  we believe that reasonable assurance of collectibility does not exist based on the results and past payment performance of licensees in general 
therefore  we do not initially recognize minimum royalty payments but instead record such revenue monthly when the minimum royalty can be reasonably estimated for that month and payment is assured 
as of april   minimum royalties to be collected in the future amounted to approximately million 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets and goodwill we have significant long lived tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions 
the most significant long lived tangible and intangible assets are fixed assets  developed technology  customer relationships  patents  and trademarks and tradenames 
all finite lived intangible assets are amortized based upon patterns in which the economic benefits of customer relationships are expected to be utilized 
the values of intangible assets  with the exception of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  were initially determined by a risk adjusted  discounted cash flow approach 
we assess the potential impairment of identifiable intangible assets and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable and at least annually 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment of such assets  include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value 
future adverse changes in these or other unforeseeable factors could result in an impairment charge that would materially impact future results of operations and financial position in the reporting period identified 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as of february  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  to assess whether impairment is present 
we have reviewed the provisions of sfas with respect to the criteria necessary to evaluate the number of reporting units that exist 
based on our review  we have determined that we operate in one reporting unit 
based on this assessment  we have not had any impairment charges during our history as a result of our impairment evaluation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets under sfas in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of those assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flows to the recorded carrying value for the asset 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
no impairment charges were taken in fiscal  or  based on the review of long lived assets under sfas significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the useful lives of our long lived assets  determining what reporting units exist and assessing when events or circumstances would require an interim impairment analysis of goodwill or other long lived assets to be performed 
changes in our organization or our management reporting structure  as well as other events and circumstances  including but not limited to technological advances  increased competition and changing economic or market conditions  could result in a shorter estimated useful lives  b additional reporting units  which may require alternative methods of estimating fair values or greater disaggregation or aggregation in our analysis by reporting unit  and or c other 
table of contents changes in previous assumptions or estimates 
in turn  this could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements through accelerated amortization and or impairment charges 
accounting for acquisitions we completed a significant business acquisition in fiscal which has resulted in significant goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
our future business strategy contemplates that we may continue to pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
our accounting for acquisitions involves significant judgments and estimates primarily  but not limited to the fair value of certain forms of consideration  the fair value of acquired intangible assets  which involve projections of future revenue and cash flows  the fair value of other acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including potential contingencies  and the useful lives and  as applicable  the reporting unit  of the assets 
our financial position or results of operations may be materially impacted by changes in our initial assumptions and estimates relating to prior or future acquisitions 
additionally  under sfas  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit  for purposes of the first step in our annual goodwill impairment test  based on our market value 
if prior or future acquisitions are not accretive to our results of operations as expected  our market value declines dramatically  or we determine we have more than one reporting unit  we may be required to complete the second step which requires significant judgments and estimates and which may result in material impairment charges in the period in which they are determined 
product liability we provide reserves for potential product liability defense costs based on estimates determined in consultation with litigation counsel 
adjustments to the provision for product liability are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are charged or credited to cost of products and services sold 
this evaluation is based upon information regarding potential or existing product liability cases 
any future costs as a result of this evaluation are recorded when considered both probable and reasonably estimable 
at this time  the estimated range of reasonably possible additional losses  as that term is defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  is zero 
environmental liability we provide reserves for potential environmental obligations that we consider probable and for which reasonable estimates of such obligations can be made 
as of april   we had a reserve of approximately  for environmental matters  which is recorded on an undiscounted basis 
inventory we value inventories  primarily consisting of finished firearms components  finished firearms  and related products and accessories  at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
an allowance for potential non saleable inventory due to excess stock or obsolescence is based upon a detailed review of inventory components  past history  and expected future usage 
warranty we generally provide a lifetime warranty to the original purchaser of our new firearms products 
we provide for estimated warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the related revenue 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical claims experience and the current repair costs 
we make adjustments to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
should we experience actual claims and repair costs that are higher than the estimated claims and repair costs used to calculate the provision  our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs materialize would be adversely impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit to our domestic customers and some foreign distributors based on their financial condition 
we offer discounts for early payment 
when we believe the extension of credit is not advisable  we rely on either a 
table of contents prepayment or a letter of credit 
we place past due balances for collection with an outside agency after days 
we write off balances deemed uncollectible by us against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts through current past due balances  knowledge of our customers financial situations  and past payment history 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon income reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
we measure these deferred taxes by applying currently enacted tax laws 
workers compensation we are self insured through retentions or deductibles for our workers compensation 
our liability for estimated premiums and incurred losses are actuarially determined and recorded on an undiscounted basis 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  shared based payment revised 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is calculated on the date of the grant using the black scholes method 
the compensation expense is then amortized over the vesting period 
the fair value of each stock option or espp purchase was estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility  and dividend yield variables

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes

a portion of our gross revenues during the three and months ended april  million and million  respectively  representing approximately and  respectively  of aggregate gross revenues came from the sale of goods that were purchased  wholly or partially from a european manufacturer  in euros 
annually  we purchase approximately million of inventory from a european supplier 
this exposes us to risk from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
a drop in the value of the us dollar in relation to the euro would  to the extent not covered through price adjustments  reduce our gross profit on that million of inventory by approximately million 
in an effort to offset our risks from unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations  we periodically enter into euro participating forward options under which we purchase euros to be used to pay the european manufacturer 
as of april   our outstanding contracts had a remaining balance of million euros 
the contracts are for  euros per month with the last expiring in december participating forward options provide full protection for us against the depreciation of the us dollar to the euro and partial benefit from the appreciation of the us dollar to the euro 
if the euro strengthens above the average rate  we will not pay more than the average rate 
if the euro weakens below the average rate  of the euros are at the average rate and the remaining of the euros are paid for at the spot rate 
each option  unless used on the first day  will be converted to a forward contract  due when needed during the month at a slight up charge in rate
