item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations american biltrite s consolidated financial statements include its majority owned subsidiary  congoleum 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum had obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  congoleum filed its proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
in november  congoleum filed the fourth plan reflecting the result of further negotiations with representatives of the acc  the fcr and other asbestos claimant representatives 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures in december and congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of the fourth plan 
in april  congoleum announced that it had reached an agreement in principle with representatives of the acc and the fcr to make certain modifications to its proposed plan of reorganization and related documents governing the settlement and payment of asbestos related claims against congoleum 
under the agreed upon modifications  asbestos claimants with claims settled under congoleum s pre petition settlement agreements would agree to forbear from exercising the security interest they were granted and share on a pari passu basis with all other present and future asbestos claimants in insurance proceeds and other assets of the plan trust to be formed upon confirmation of the plan under section g of the bankruptcy code to pay asbestos claims against congoleum 
in july  congoleum filed the sixth plan and related documents with the bankruptcy court which reflected the result of these negotiations  as well as other technical modifications 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement and voting procedures and congoleum commenced solicitation of acceptances of the sixth plan in august in september  congoleum learned that certain asbestos claimants were unwilling to agree to forbear from exercising their security interest as contemplated by the sixth plan and the sixth plan was subsequently withdrawn 
in november  the bankruptcy court denied a request to extend congoleum s exclusive right to file a plan of reorganization and solicit acceptances thereof 
in march  congoleum filed the eighth plan 
in addition  an insurance company  cna  filed a plan of reorganization and the bondholders committee also filed a plan of reorganization 
in may  the bankruptcy court ordered the principal parties in interest in congoleum s reorganization proceedings to participate in reorganization plan mediation discussions 
several mediation sessions took place from june through september during the initial mediation negotiations  congoleum reached an agreement in principle  subject to mutually agreeable definitive documentation  with the acc  the fcr and abi  congoleum s controlling shareholder  on certain terms of the ninth plan  which congoleum filed and proposed jointly with the acc in august cna and the bondholders committee jointly filed a new  competing plan in august and each withdrew its prior plan of reorganization 
following further mediated negotiations  congoleum  the acc  the fcr  abi and the bondholders committee reached agreement on terms of the tenth plan  which congoleum filed jointly with the acc in september in light of the bondholders committee s support of the tenth plan  the bondholders committee withdrew its support of the cna plan 
following the bondholders committee s withdrawal of support for cna s plan  cna filed the cna plan 
in october  congoleum and the acc jointly filed  the eleventh plan  which reflected minor technical changes to the eleventh plan agreed to by the various parties supporting congoleum s plan 
in october  the bankruptcy court held a hearing to consider the adequacy of the disclosure statements with respect to the tenth plan and the cna plan and to hear argument on summary judgment motions seeking determinations that the tenth plan and the cna plan  respectively  are not confirmable as a matter of law 
the bankruptcy court provisionally approved the disclosure statements for both the tenth plan and the cna plan subject to the bankruptcy court s ruling on the respective summary judgment motions 
in february  the bankruptcy court entered on its docket two separate opinions ruling that the tenth plan and the cna plan are each not confirmable as a matter of law 
because the tenth plan and eleventh plan are substantially identical  congoleum believes the ruling issued with respect to the tenth plan also applies to the eleventh plan 
in march  congoleum and other parties in interest resumed plan mediation discussions seeking to resolve the plan confirmation issues raised in the bankruptcy court s ruling with respect to the tenth plan 
congoleum has also appealed the ruling with respect to the tenth plan to the district court 
there can be no assurance that congoleum will be successful in its appeal or in negotiating a new plan of reorganization that resolves the issues raised in the bankruptcy court s ruling with respect to the tenth plan  that congoleum will obtain approval to solicit acceptances of a new plan of reorganization  that congoleum will receive the acceptances necessary for confirmation of a plan of reorganization  that any plan proposed will not be modified further  that a plan will receive necessary court approvals from the bankruptcy court and the district court  or that such approvals will be received in a timely fashion  that a plan will be confirmed  that a plan  if confirmed  will become effective  or that there will be sufficient funds to pay for continued litigation with respect to congoleum s chapter case or the new jersey state court insurance coverage case which congoleum is pursuing against certain of its insurance carriers as further discussed elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
it also is unclear whether any other person will attempt to propose a plan or what any such plan would provide or propose  and whether the bankruptcy court would approve such a plan 
the terms of any new plan of reorganization are likely to be materially different from the tenth and eleventh plans  including with respect to the company and its interests  such as the company s congoleum equity interests and the amount and form of any contribution the company may be required to contribute to the plan trust in order to receive the limited channeling injunctive relief that would have been provided to the company under the eleventh plan 
further  any new plan of reorganization could be amended or modified as a result of further negotiations with various parties 
congoleum expects that it will take until some time late in the third quarter of at the earliest to obtain confirmation of any plan of reorganization 
furthermore  the estimated costs and contributions to effect any plan of reorganization could be significantly greater than currently estimated 
under any outcome  abi anticipates its equity interest in congoleum is likely to be substantially diluted or eliminated 
any plan of reorganization pursued by congoleum will be subject to numerous conditions  approvals and other requirements  including bankruptcy court and federal district court approvals  and there can be no assurance that such conditions  approvals and other requirements will be satisfied or obtained 
congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities  and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plans of reorganization and related matters and are expected to file objections to any future plan 
certain other parties have also filed various objections to congoleum s previously proposed plans of reorganization and may file objections to any future plan 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into a settlement agreement with various asbestos personal injury claimants the claimant agreement  which provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million as well as an additional number of individually negotiated trial listed settlements with an aggregate value of approximately million  for total settlements in excess of million 
as contemplated by the claimant agreement  congoleum also entered into agreements establishing a pre petition trust the collateral trust to distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the claimant agreement and granting the collateral trust a security interest in congoleum s rights under its applicable insurance coverage and payments from congoleum s insurers for asbestos claims 
in december  congoleum commenced an avoidance action seeking to void the security interest granted to the collateral trust 
in december  congoleum commenced an omnibus avoidance action and a sealed avoidance action collectively  the avoidance actions seeking to void the security interest granted to the collateral trust and such settlements 
in march  congoleum filed a motion for summary judgment in the avoidance actions seeking to avoid the claimant agreement settlements and liens under various bankruptcy theories  which motion was denied in june  and the avoidance actions remain pending 
due to  among other things  the on going avoidance actions  the liability associated with the asbestos personal injury claims against congoleum may be materially different than the present estimates of such items 
as a result of tabulating ballots on the fourth plan  congoleum is also aware of claims by claimants whose claims were not determined under the claimant agreement but who have submitted claims with a value of approximately million based on the settlement values applicable in the sixth plan 
abi estimates that it will spend an additional thousand for legal fees in  which it has accrued  and has also accrued thousand for a contribution to the plan trust in connection with congoleum s reorganization plan 
actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust by congoleum and abi and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and congoleum and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
treatment of congoleum s existing shareholders  including abi  under any future plan of reorganization cannot be determined at this time 
abi anticipates that  under any outcome  its equity interest in congoleum is likely to be substantially diluted or eliminated 
in addition  abi is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits in addition to those brought against congoleum 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference

results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation

under the terms of the congoleum s eleventh plan  abi would have contributed thousand in cash to the plan trust on the effective date of the plan 
in addition  abi would have agreed to forego certain rights it has to receive indemnification payments from congoleum for asbestos claims pursuant to a joint venture agreement that abi and congoleum are party to 
abi would also have received certain relief as may be afforded under section g of the bankruptcy code from asbestos personal injury claims that derive from claims made against congoleum  which claims were expected to have been channeled to the plan trust 
however  the eleventh plan did not provide that any other asbestos claims that may be asserted against abi would be channeled to the plan trust 
the bankruptcy court has ruled that congoleum s eleventh plan is not confirmable as a matter of law and that abi s contribution of thousand is not sufficient to entitle it to relief under section g of the bankruptcy code 
it is not yet known what terms will be negotiated in any future amended plan of reorganization for congoleum  what contribution might be sought from abi under the terms of such plan  what benefits abi might receive  and what action abi might take in response to any proposed terms 
it is also not known how any future amended plan of reorganization for congoleum will treat the interests of creditors and shareholders of congoleum  including abi 
under the terms of the eleventh plan  abi s equity interest in congoleum would have been significantly reduced  and any future amended plan could further reduce or wholly eliminate abi s congoleum equity interests 
while the company does not believe the loss of the value of its equity interest in congoleum would have a direct material adverse effect on abi s liquidity  it could have a material adverse impact on congoleum s business  operations and financial condition  and directly or indirectly  a material adverse impact on the business relationships between abi and congoleum  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on abi s business  operations and financial condition 
the company has not declared a dividend subsequent to the third quarter of future dividends  if any  will be determined by the company s board of directors based upon the financial performance and capital requirements of the company  among other considerations

as described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about congoleum s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court case no 
seeking relief under the bankruptcy code 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item of his annual report on form k for a discussion on congoleum s bankruptcy proceedings 
these matters continue to have a material adverse impact on liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses net of recoveries related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
furthermore  at december  congoleum had incurred but not paid approximately million in additional fees and expenses for services rendered through that date 
under plans prior to the tenth plan  congoleum s assignment of insurance recoveries to the plan trust was net of costs incurred by congoleum in connection with insurance coverage litigation  and congoleum was entitled to withhold from recoveries  or seek reimbursement from the plan trust  for coverage litigation costs incurred after january  and for million in claims processing fees paid in connection with claims settled under the claimant agreement 
a receivable was recorded for these costs as they were paid 
under the eleventh plan  congoleum would have been entitled to reimbursement of only the million in claims processing fees and would not have collected the balance of these receivables million at december  
the write off  as well as forgiveness of indebtedness income pursuant to any future plan and any other applicable charges or credits is expected to be recorded at a future date  the net effect of which cannot be determined 
congoleum is unable to predict whether it will be reimbursed for claims processing fees and coverage litigation costs to the extent not already reimbursed 
congoleum cannot presently determine the amount of fees  expenses  and trust contributions it may incur in connection with obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
due to the chapter proceedings  congoleum has been precluded from making interest payments on its outstanding senior notes since january  the amount of accrued interest that is due but has not been paid on the senior notes at december  is approximately million  including interest on the unpaid interest due  of which million was owed at the time of the chapter filing 
in march  the bankruptcy court approved the retention of gilbert  heintz randolph llp ghr as special insurance counsel to congoleum 
an insurance company appealed the retention order 
in october  the court of appeals for the third circuit issued an opinion disqualifying ghr from serving as counsel to congoleum 
in february  the bankruptcy court ordered ghr to disgorge all fees and certain expenses it was paid by congoleum 
the amount of the disgorgement is approximately million 
in october  congoleum and ghr entered into a settlement agreement the ghr settlement under which ghr would pay congoleum approximately million in full satisfaction of the disgorgement order 
the payment would be made secured by assets of ghr and would be made over time according to a formula based on ghr s earnings 
congoleum has filed a motion seeking bankruptcy court approval of the ghr settlement which is pending 
treatment of funds received pursuant to the ghr settlement under a future amended plan of reorganization may differ from the treatment accorded by any prior plans 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  a decrease of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on congoleum s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by congoleum to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
funds deposited in this account but not yet applied to the loan balance  which amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively  are recorded as restricted cash 
additionally  million remaining from a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to the lien of the collateral trust  is included as restricted cash at december  congoleum expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust 
working capital was million at december   up from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was to  the same ratio at december  net cash used by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operations of million in capital expenditures in totaled million  which includes million reimbursed by congoleum s property insurer for replacement of a damaged production line 
congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on i the earlier of june  and ii the date the plan of reorganization in congoleum s bankruptcy cases as confirmed by the bankruptcy court becomes effective 
total borrowing under the facility may not exceed million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility including anticipated extensions thereof  together with cash from operations  will provide it with sufficient liquidity to operate during while under chapter protection 
there can be no assurances that congoleum will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants under this facility or that the debtor in possession facility as extended will be renewed prior to its expiration if a plan of reorganization is not confirmed before that time 
for a plan of reorganization to be confirmed  congoleum will need to obtain and demonstrate the sufficiency of exit financing 
congoleum cannot presently determine the terms of such financing  nor can there be any assurances of its success obtaining it 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congoleum s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
congoleum cannot presently determine the amount of fees  expenses  and trust contributions it may incur in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
congoleum believes that its existing cash including restricted cash  cash generated from operations  and debtor in possession credit arrangements should be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for operations during congoleum s ability to emerge from chapter will depend on obtaining sufficient exit financing to settle administrative expenses of the reorganization and any other related obligations  and to provide adequate future liquidity 
the following table summarizes congoleum s contractual obligations  for future minimum rental payments on its non cancelable operating leases and future minimum pension plans and other post employment benefits opeb funding 
the timing and amount of any future payments of principal and interest on long term debt  and any contributions to any plan trust  will depend on the terms of any future amended plan of reorganization  so these payments are not shown in the following table 
payments due by period in thousands and total thereafter operating leases      pension plans funding        opeb funding   the projected pension plans funding was actuarially determined using the following assumptions i the funding provisions of the pension protection act of becomes effective in  ii assets and liabilities were projected using generally accepted actuarial methods and there are no gains or losses for and later  and iii the discount rate used to value the liabilities is the same as that used to value irs current liability and is assumed to remain unchanged after the total for and thereafter include projected contributions for the years through for one of congoleum s pension plans and through for two of congoleum s pension plans 
contributions can be assumed to increase with inflation after and  respectively 
congoleum s other post employment benefit plan is an unfunded plan 
funding requirements each year are assumed to approximate the expenses for each year see note of notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results and conditions may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company is party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the claims dismissal rate  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
additionally  due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed for claim developments beyond a six year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next six years 
a change in assumptions could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability 
for example  it is estimated that a decrease in the company s dismissal rate would result in a increase in liability assuming all other variables remained constant 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from those assumed in developing the company s estimates 
the same factors that affect developing forecasts of potential indemnity costs for asbestos related liabilities also affect estimates of the total amount of insurance that is probable of recovery  as do a number of additional factors 
these additional factors include the financial viability of some of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies  how legal and other loss handling costs will be covered by the insurance policies  and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships 
the company analyzes these estimates on an annual basis and reassesses the assumptions used as additional information becomes available over the course of time 
congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses net of recoveries related to its reorganization case under chapter of the bankruptcy code and litigation with certain insurance companies 
pursuant to terms of the eighth plan and related documents  congoleum was entitled to reimbursement for certain expenses it incurs for claims processing costs and expenses in connection with pursuit of insurance coverage 
at december   congoleum had million recorded as a receivable for such reimbursements 
under the eleventh plan  congoleum would be entitled to reimbursement of only the million in claims processing costs and would not collect the balance of these receivables million at december  
disposition of these balances  including their write off or any other applicable charges or credits pursuant to any new amended plan of reorganization are expected to be recorded at a future date  the net effect of which cannot be determined at this time 
there can be no assurances that any reimbursements will be received 
congoleum cannot presently determine the amount of fees  expenses  and trust contributions it may incur or be required to make in connection with obtaining confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
congoleum expects that insurance will provide the substantial majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
in light of its bankruptcy filing  congoleum believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the plan trust plus the costs to effect the reorganization 
congoleum is not yet able to determine the additional costs that may be required to affect a new amended plan and actual amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and implementing any plan of reorganization could be materially higher than recorded amounts and previous estimates 
congoleum will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
consolidation of congoleum the company s subsidiary congoleum filed for bankruptcy protection on december  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results for congoleum for all periods presented 
abi continues to own a majority of the voting stock of congoleum 
the company expects to continue to control congoleum while it is in bankruptcy 
accordingly  the company has elected to continue to consolidate the financial statements of congoleum in its consolidated results because it believes that is the appropriate presentation given its current control of congoleum 
however  the accompanying financial statements also present the details of consolidation to separately show the financial condition  operating results and cash flows of abi including its non debtor subsidiaries and congoleum  which may be more meaningful for certain analyses 
abi s reported consolidated financial condition  operating results and cash flows consolidated results would be materially different if they did not include congoleum 
the company anticipates its equity interest in congoleum will be substantially reduced at a minimum in connection with effectiveness of any future congoleum plan of reorganization  at which time it may no longer be appropriate to include congoleum in the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company accrues for its estimate of future remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
for sites with multiple potentially responsible parties  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage or payment from third parties  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the expected recovery 
a receivable reserve is recorded when recoveries are disputed or are not highly probable 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
the company closely monitors existing and potential environmental matters to minimize costs 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize as anticipated in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the company s employees 
the company also maintains health and life insurance programs for retirees 
benefits under the plans are based on years of service and employee compensation 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
in  the company assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is used to determine expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances where the company is made aware of specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously noted 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
inventory allowances the company maintains obsolescence and slow moving allowances for inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is maintained to properly value these inventories 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in prevailing market interest rates affecting the return on its investments 
the company invests primarily in highly liquid debt instruments with strong credit ratings and short term less than one year maturities 
the carrying amount of these investments approximates fair value due to the short term maturities 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
in addition  substantially all of the company s outstanding long term debt as of december  consisted of indebtedness with a fixed rate of interest  which is not subject to change based upon changes in prevailing market interest rates  or the rate of interest on long term debt has been fixed through interest rate swap agreements 
during  in connection with its debt refinancing  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its term loan and portions of its revolver borrowings 
these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of the company s operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities in foreign jurisdictions 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  canada  belgium and singapore and sells those products in those markets as well as countries of europe and asia 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
the company s operating results are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and canadian dollar and the us dollar and the euro 
when the us dollar strengthens against the canadian dollar or euro  the us dollar value of foreign currency sales decreases 
when the us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of the foreign currency amount of sales increases 
under their current policies  other than the interest rate swap agreements  neither the company nor congoleum use derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments to manage their exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or equity prices and does not hold any instruments for trading purposes
