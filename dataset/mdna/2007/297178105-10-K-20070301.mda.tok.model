business objectives and strategies the following is a discussion of our business objectives and strategies in regards to real estate investment and management 
one or more of these criteria may be amended or rescinded from time to time without stockholder vote 
business objectives our primary business objectives are to increase shareholders value by investing in properties located in supply constrained markets  and by improving operating results and the value of our properties  while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
we intend to achieve these objectives by pursuing an occupancy and rent rate growth strategy that capitalizes on the locations of our properties  expanding our portfolio through acquisitions  development and  when appropriate  re development of apartment communities in selected major metropolitan areas  optimizing financial performance through a portfolio asset allocation program  and to increase or decrease investments in a market based on projected changes in regional economic and local market conditions  and maintaining a conservative leverage ratio by identifying and utilizing capital resources that provide a lower cost of capital 
we cannot assure our shareholders that we will achieve our business objectives 
business strategies research driven approach we believe that successful real estate investment decisions and portfolio growth begin with extensive regional economic research and local market knowledge 
utilizing a proprietary research model that we have developed over the last two decades  we continually assess markets where we currently operate  as well as markets where we consider future investment opportunities by evaluating markets in major metropolitan areas that have regional population primarily in excess of one million  thereby creating liquidity  which is an important element when modifying the geographic concentration of the company s portfolio in response to changing market conditions  demand for housing that is greater than supply driven by i low availability of developable land sites where competing housing could be built  ii political growth barriers  such as protected land  urban growth boundaries  and potential lengthy and expensive development permit processes  and iii natural limitations to development  such as mountains or waterways  markets where rental demand is enhanced by expensive for sale housing  and housing demand that is based on proximity to jobs  high quality of life and related commuting factors  as well as potential job growth 
recognizing that all real estate markets are cyclical  we regularly evaluate the results of our regional economic  as well as  our local market research and adjust the geographic focus of our portfolio accordingly 
we seek to increase our portfolio allocation in markets projected to have the strongest local economies and to decrease such allocations in markets projected to have declining economic conditions 
likewise  the company also seeks to increase its portfolio allocation in markets that have attractive property valuations and to decrease such allocations in markets that have inflated valuations and low relative yields 
property operations we manage our properties by focusing on strategies that will generate above average rental growth  tenant retention satisfaction and long term asset appreciation 
we intend to achieve this by utilizing the strategies set forth below property management the chief operating officer  divisional managers  regional portfolio managers and area managers are accountable for the performance and maintenance of the properties 
they supervise  provide training for the on site managers  manage budgeted expectations against performance  monitor market trends and prepare operating and capital budgets 
capital preservation the capital and maintenance department is responsible for the planning  budgeting  and completion of major deferred maintenance and capital improvement projects at our properties 
business planning and control comprehensive business plans are implemented in conjunction with every investment decision 
these plans include benchmarks for future financial performance  based on collaborative discussions between on site managers and senior management 
development and redevelopment we focus on acquiring and developing apartment communities in supply constrained markets  and redeveloping our existing communities to improve the financial and physical aspects of our communities 
current business activities acquisitions acquisitions have been a significant growth component of our business 
during  we completed a series of acquisitions that added to our overall portfolio 
in january  the company acquired two apartment communities chimney sweep and cbc  aggregating units  located in goleta  california for a combined price of approximately million 
in september  the company acquired hillsdale garden  a unit apartment community located in san mateo  california for approximately million 
the property is subject to a ground lease with annual payments of  that will expire in in october  the company acquired belmont terrace  a unit apartment community located in belmont  california for approximately million in a transaction structured as an upreit 
in december  the company acquired camino ruiz square  a unit apartment community located in camarillo  california for approximately million 
dispositions as part of our strategic plan to own quality real estate in supply constrained markets  we continually evaluate our properties and sell those which no longer meet our strategic criteria 
we may use the capital generated from the dispositions to invest in higher return properties or repay debts 
we believe that the sale of these properties will not have a material impact on our future results of operations or cash flows nor will their sale materially affect our ongoing operations 
generally  any impact of earnings dilution resulting from these dispositions will be offset by the positive impact of our acquisitions  development and redevelopment activities 
in january  the company sold vista capri east and casa tierra apartment communities for approximately million and in march  the company sold diamond valley recreational vehicle park for approximately million  for a combined gain of million 
in june  the unconsolidated joint venture property  vista pointe  a unit apartment community located in anaheim  california  was sold for approximately million 
the company s share of the proceeds from the transaction totaled million  resulting in an million gain on the sale  and million for fees and a promote distribution 
in december  the company sold emerald palms  a unit apartment community located in san diego for approximately million  for a gain of approximately million 
during the company undertook a condominium conversion of the peregrine point property  a trs  in issaquah  washington 
in april  the property was reclassified from a rental property to real estate under development 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company sold of the available condominiums  for an aggregate gain of million  net of taxes and expenses 
the remaining units are expected to be sold in the first four months of city heights  a unit community located in los angeles was classified as held for sale as of december   and was sold to a third party for a gain in february development and predevelopment pipeline the company defines development activities as new properties that are being constructed  or are newly constructed and  in the case of development communities  are in a phase of lease up and have not yet reached stabilized operations  or  in the case of trs development projects  have not yet been sold 
as of december   the company had two development projects comprised of units for an estimated cost of million  of which million remains to be expended excluding development projects owned by essex apartment value fund ii  lp the company also incurred million in costs related to a joint venture development with a third party 
the company defines the predevelopment pipeline as new properties in negotiation or in the entitlement process with a high likelihood of becoming development activities

redevelopment pipeline the company defines redevelopment communities as existing properties owned or recently acquired  which have been targeted for additional investment by the company with the expectation of increased financial returns through property improvement 
during redevelopment  apartment units may not be available for rent and  as a result  may have less than stabilized operations 
as of december   the company had ownership interests in twelve major redevelopment communities aggregating  apartment units with estimated redevelopment costs of million  of which approximately million remains to be expended 
these amounts exclude redevelopment projects owned by fund ii

debt transactions in january  the company originated a mortgage loan secured by the fairwood pond apartment community in the amount of million  with a fixed interest rate of  which matures on february  in march  the company paid off a loan secured by the windsor ridge apartment community in the amount of million  with a fixed interest rate of 
in march  the company renegotiated its revolving line of credit to increase the maximum principal amount to million from million 
additionally  the maturity date was extended from april to march  with an option for a one year extension  and the underlying rate  based on a tiered rate structure tied to the company s corporate ratings  was reduced to libor plus from libor plus 
derivative transactions as of december  the company had entered into forward starting interest rate swaps totaling a notional amount of million with interest rates ranging from to and settlements dates ranging from april to july these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting and will economically hedge the cash flows associated with the refinancing of debt that matures between april and july the decrease in the fair value of these derivatives during the year ended december  was approximately million and is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the company s consolidated financial statements 
no hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges was recognized during the year ended december  equity transactions during the third quarter of  the company sold  shares of series g cumulative convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of million 
holders may convert series g preferred stock into shares of the company s common stock subject to certain conditions 
the conversion rate will initially be 
shares of common stock per the per share liquidation preference  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
on or after july   the company may  under certain circumstances  cause some or all of the series g preferred stock to be converted into that number of shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate 
the company used the net proceeds from the series g offering to pay down outstanding borrowings under the company s lines of credit  to fund the development pipeline and for general corporate purposes 
during  the company issued and sold approximately  shares of common stock for million  net of fees and commissions  under its controlled equity offering program 
under this program  the company may from time to time sell shares of common stock into the existing trading market at current market prices  and the company used the net proceeds from such sales to primarily fund real estate investments 
essex apartment value funds essex apartment value fund  lp fund i and fund ii  are investment funds formed by the company to add value through rental growth and asset appreciation  utilizing the company s development  redevelopment and asset management capabilities 
all of the assets in fund i were sold during and  and fund i is in the process of liquidation

essex has committed million to fund ii  which represents a interest as general partner and limited partner 
fund ii expects to utilize leverage equal to approximately of the estimated value of the underlying real estate 
fund ii invests in apartment communities in the company s targeted west coast markets with an emphasis on investment opportunities in the seattle metropolitan area and the san francisco bay area

offices and employees the company is headquartered in palo alto  california  and has regional offices in woodland hills  california  irvine  california  san diego  california  bellevue  washington  and portland  oregon 
as of december   the company had approximately employees 
insurance the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties 
there are  however  certain types of extraordinary losses  such as  for example  losses from terrorism or earthquake  for which the company does not have insurance coverage 
substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity 
the company believes it has a proactive approach to its potential earthquake losses 
the company utilizes third party seismic consultants for its acquisitions and performs seismic upgrades to those acquisitions that are determined to have a higher level of potential loss from an earthquake 
the company utilizes internal and third party loss models to help to determine its exposure 
in addition  the majority of the company s properties are lower density garden style apartments which may be less susceptible to earthquake damage 
the company will continue to monitor third party earthquake insurance pricing and conditions and may consider obtaining third party coverage if it deems it cost effective in the future 
although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties  employees  residents  and compliance with applicable laws  it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks  deductibles  co payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 
competition there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents 
these include other apartment communities and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located 
the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale 
if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop and or acquire competing properties on a more cost effective basis  rental rates and occupancy may drop  which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face competition from other real estate investment trusts  businesses and other entities in the acquisition  development and operation of properties 
some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire and or develop 
working capital we believe that cash flows generated by our operations  existing cash balances  availability under existing lines of credit  access to capital markets and the ability to generate cash gains from the disposition of real estate are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during the timing  source and amounts of cash flows provided by financing activities and used in investing activities are sensitive to changes in interest rates and other fluctuations in the capital markets environment  which can affect our plans for acquisitions  dispositions  development and redevelopment activities 
environmental considerations see the discussion under the caption  possible environmental liabilities in item a  risk factors  for information concerning the potential effect of environmental regulations on our operations 
other matters certain policies of the company we intend to continue to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of the company has in the past five years and may in the future i issue securities senior to its common stock  ii fund acquisition activities with borrowings under its line of credit and iii offer shares of common stock and or units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership or affiliated partnerships as partial consideration for property acquisitions 
the company from time to time acquires partnership interests in partnerships and joint ventures  either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries of the company  when such entities underlying assets are real estate 
in general  the company does not i underwrite securities of other issuers or ii actively trade in loans or other investments 
we invest primarily in apartment communities that are located in predominantly coastal markets within southern california  the san francisco bay area  and parts of the pacific northwest 
the company currently intends to continue to invest in apartment communities in such regions 
however  these practices may be reviewed and modified periodically by management 
item a 
risk factors our business  operating results  cash flows and financial conditions are subject to various risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  those set forth below  any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results 
we depend on our key personnel our success depends on our ability to attract and retain executive officers  senior officers and company managers 
there is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry and the loss of several of our key personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
debt financing at december   we had approximately billion of indebtedness including million of variable rate indebtedness  of which million is subject to interest rate protection agreements 
we are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing  including the following cash flow may not be sufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  inability to refinance maturing indebtedness on encumbered properties  the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness  inability to comply with debt covenants could cause an acceleration of the maturity date  and repaying debt before the scheduled maturity date could result in prepayment penalties 
uncertainty of our ability to refinance balloon payments as of december   we had approximately billion of mortgage debt  exchangeable bonds and line of credit borrowings  most of which are subject to balloon payments 
we do not expect to have sufficient cash flows from operations to make all of these balloon payments 
these mortgages  bonds and lines of credit borrowings have the following scheduled principal and balloon payments million  million  million  million  million  thereafter million 
we may not be able to refinance such mortgage indebtedness  bonds  or lines of credit 
the properties subject to these mortgages could be foreclosed upon or otherwise transferred to the lender 
this could cause us to lose income and asset value 
we may be required to refinance the debt at higher interest rates or on terms that may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
debt financing on properties may result in insufficient cash flow where possible  we intend to continue to use leverage to increase the rate of return on our investments and to provide for additional investments that we could not otherwise make 
there is a risk that the cash flow from the properties will be insufficient to meet both debt payment obligations and the distribution requirements of the real estate investment trust provisions of the internal revenue code 
we may obtain additional debt financing in the future  through mortgages on some or all of the properties 
these mortgages may be recourse  non recourse  or cross collateralized 
as of december   essex had of its consolidated apartment communities encumbered by debt 
of the properties  are secured by deeds of trust relating solely to those properties 
with respect to the remaining properties  there are cross collateralized mortgages secured by properties  properties  properties and properties  respectively 
the holders of this indebtedness will have claims against these properties and  to the extent indebtedness is cross collateralized  lenders may seek to foreclose upon properties  which are not the primary collateral for their loan 
this may accelerate other indebtedness secured by properties 
foreclosure of properties would reduce our income and net asset value 
risk of rising interest rates current interest rates could potentially increase rapidly  which could result in higher interest expense on our variable rate indebtedness 
prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and our ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 
as of december   we had approximately million of long term variable rate indebtedness bearing interest at floating rates tied to the rate of short term tax exempt revenue bonds which mature at various dates from through  and million of variable rate indebtedness under our lines of credit  bearing interest at the freddie mac reference rate plus from to 
approximately million of the long term indebtedness is subject to interest rate cap protection agreements  which may reduce the risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates 
the remaining million of long term variable rate indebtedness was not subject to any interest rate cap protection agreements as of december  an increase in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our net income and results of operations 
risk of losses on interest rate hedging arrangements periodically  we have entered into agreements to reduce the risks associated with increases in interest rates  and may continue to do so 
although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates  they also may reduce the benefits to us if interest rates decline 
if a hedging arrangement is not indexed to the same rate as the indebtedness that is hedged  we may be exposed to losses to the extent that the rate governing the indebtedness and the rate governing the hedging arrangement change independently of each other 
finally  nonperformance by the other party to the hedging arrangement may subject us to increased credit risks 
in order to minimize counterparty credit risk  our policy is to enter into hedging arrangements only with a rated financial institutions 
bond compliance requirements may limit income from certain properties at december   we had approximately million of variable rate tax exempt financing relating to the inglenook court apartments  wandering creek apartments  treetops apartments  huntington breakers apartments  camarillo oaks apartments  fountain park  anchor village and parker ranch apartments 
this tax exempt financing subjects these properties to certain deed restrictions and restrictive covenants 
we expect to engage in tax exempt financings in the future 
in addition  the internal revenue code and rules and regulations thereunder impose various restrictions  conditions and requirements excluding interest on qualified bond obligations from gross income for federal income tax purposes 
the internal revenue code also requires that at least of apartment units be made available to residents with gross incomes that do not exceed a specified percentage  generally  of the median income for the applicable family size as determined by the housing and urban development department of the federal government 
in addition to federal requirements  certain state and local authorities may impose additional rental restrictions 
these restrictions may limit income from the tax exempt financed properties if we are required to lower rental rates to attract residents who satisfy the median income test 
if essex does not reserve the required number of apartment homes for residents satisfying these income requirements  the tax exempt status of the bonds may be terminated  the obligations under the bond documents may be accelerated and we may be subject to additional contractual liability 
adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks real property investments are subject to a variety of risks 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend on the amount of income generated and expenses incurred 
if the properties do not generate sufficient income to meet operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  cash flow and the ability to make distributions to stockholders will be adversely affected 
the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy  market rental rates and expenses 
consequently  the income from the properties and their underlying values may be impacted 
the financial results of major local employers may have an impact on the cash flow and value of certain of the properties as well 
income from the properties may be further adversely affected by  among other things  the following factors the general economic climate  local economic conditions in which the properties are located  such as oversupply of housing or a reduction in demand for rental housing  the attractiveness of the properties to tenants  competition from other available space  and essex s ability to provide for adequate maintenance and insurance 
as leases on the properties expire  tenants may enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us 
income and real estate values also may be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws eg  the americans with disabilities act of and tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability and terms of financing 
real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  our ability to vary our portfolio promptly in response to changes in economic or other conditions may be quite limited 
economic environment and impact on operating results the national economy and the economies of the western states in markets where we operate can impact our operating results 
some of these markets are concentrated in high tech sectors  which have experienced economic downturns  and could again in the future 
our property type and diverse geographic locations provide some degree of risk mitigation 
however  we are not immune to prolonged economic downturns 
although we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges  it is possible a reduction in rental rates  occupancy levels  property valuations and increases in operating costs such as advertising  turnover and repair and maintenance expense could occur in the event of economic uncertainty 
risk of inflation deflation substantial inflationary or deflationary pressures could have a negative effect on rental rates and property operating expenses 
risks that acquisitions will fail to meet expectations we intend to continue to acquire apartment communities 
however  there are risks that acquisitions will fail to meet our expectations 
our estimates of future income  expenses and the costs of improvements or redevelopment that are necessary to allow us to market an acquired property as originally intended may prove to be inaccurate 
we expect to finance future acquisitions  in whole or in part  under various forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of partnership units by the operating partnership or related partnerships or additional equity by essex 
the use of equity financing  rather than debt  for future developments or acquisitions could dilute the interest of essex s existing stockholders 
if we finance new acquisitions under existing lines of credit  there is a risk that  unless we obtain substitute financing  essex may not be able to secure further lines of credit for new development or such lines of credit may be not available on advantageous terms 
risks that development activities will be delayed  not completed  and or not achieve expected results we pursue apartment community development projects and these projects generally require various governmental and other approvals  which have no assurance of being received 
our development activities generally entail certain risks  including the following funds may be expended and management s time devoted to projects that may not be completed  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates  possibly making the project economically unfeasible  development projects may be delayed due to  without limitation  adverse weather conditions  labor shortages  or unforeseen complications  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and the operating expenses at a completed development may be higher than anticipated 
these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to essex s stockholders 
further  the development of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 
for further information regarding these risks  please see adverse effect to property income and value due to general real estate investment risks 
the geographic concentration of our properties and fluctuations in local markets may adversely impact our financial condition and operating results we generated significant amounts of rental revenues for the year ended december  from properties concentrated in southern california los angeles  ventura  orange  san diego and riverside counties  northern california the san francisco bay area  and the pacific northwest the seattle  washington and portland  oregon metropolitan areas 
as of december   more than half of our properties were located in california 
this geographic concentration could present risks if local property market performance falls below expectations 
the economic condition of these markets could affect occupancy  market rental rates  and expenses  as well as impact the income generated from the properties and their underlying asset values 
the financial results of major local employers also may impact the cash flow and value of certain of the properties 
this could have a negative impact on our financial condition and operating results  which could affect our ability to pay expected dividends to our stockholders 
competition in the apartment community market may adversely affect operations and the rental demand for our properties there are numerous housing alternatives that compete with our apartment communities in attracting residents 
these include other apartment communities and single family homes that are available for rent in the markets in which the properties are located 
the properties also compete for residents with new and existing homes and condominiums that are for sale 
if the demand for our properties is reduced or if competitors develop and or acquire competing properties on a more cost effective basis  rental rates may drop  which may have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also face competition from other real estate investment trusts  businesses and other entities in the acquisition  development and operation of properties 
some of the competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
this competition may result in increased costs of properties we acquire and or develop 
dividend requirements as a result of preferred stock may lead to a possible inability to sustain dividends we have series f cumulative redeemable preferred stock series f preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million outstanding and series g cumulative convertible preferred stock series g preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million outstanding 
in addition  we are required under limited conditions to issue series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock series b preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of million and series d cumulative redeemable preferred stock series d preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of million in each case in exchange for outstanding preferred interests in the operating partnership 
the terms of the series b  d  f and g preferred stock provide for certain cumulative preferential cash distributions per each share of preferred stock 
these terms also provide that while such preferred stock is outstanding  we cannot authorize  declare  or pay any distributions on our common stock  unless all distributions accumulated on all shares of such preferred stock have been paid in full 
our failure to pay distributions on such preferred stock would impair our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
our credit agreement limits our ability to pay dividends on our preferred stock if we fail to satisfy a fixed charge coverage ratio 
if essex wishes to issue any common stock in the future including upon the exercise of stock options  the funds required to continue to pay cash dividends at current levels will be increased 
essex s ability to pay dividends will depend largely upon the performance of our current properties and other properties that may be acquired or developed in the future 
if essex cannot pay dividends on its common stock  essex s status as a real estate investment trust may be jeopardized 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock is further limited by the maryland general corporation law 
under the maryland general corporation law  essex may not make a distribution on stock if  after giving effect to such distribution  either we would not be able to pay our indebtedness as it becomes due in the usual course of business  or our total assets would be less than our total liabilities  including the liquidation preference on our series b  series d  series f  and series g preferred stock 
resale of shares pursuant to our effective registration statement or that are issued upon conversion of our convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares essex has the following effective registration statements  which allows for the resale into the public stock of common stock held by stockholders  as specified in the registration statements a registration statement  declared effective in  which covers the resale of up to  shares  including i up to  shares issued  or potentially issuable  in connection with the acquisition of john m 
sachs  inc  a real estate company  ii up to  shares of common stock that are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and iii up to  shares that are issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in certain other real estate partnerships  registration statements  declared effective in  that cover i the resale of up to  shares issuable in connection with our waterford and vista belvedere acquisitions and ii the resale of shares issuable in connection with the exchange rights of our exchangeable senior notes  as to which there is a principal amount of million outstanding 
during the third quarter of  we issued  pursuant to a registration statement   million shares of series g cumulative preferred stock for estimated gross proceeds of million  such shares are convertible  subject to certain conditions  into common stock  which could be resold into the public market 
the resale of the shares of common stock pursuant to these various registration statements or that are issued upon conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stock may have an adverse effect on the market price of our shares 
the exchange and repurchase rights of exchangeable senior notes and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of common stock the operating partnership has million principal amount of exchangeable senior notes the notes outstanding which mature on november  the notes are exchangeable into the company s common stock on or after november  or prior to november  under certain circumstances 
the notes are redeemable at the company s option for cash at any time on or after november  and are subject to repurchase for cash at the option of the holder on november st in the years  and  or upon the occurrence of certain events 
the notes are senior unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the company 
in  the company sold  million shares of series g cumulative convertible preferred stock the series g preferred stock for gross proceeds of million 
holders may convert series g preferred stock into shares of the company s common stock subject to certain conditions 
the conversion rate will initially be 
shares of common stock per share liquidation preference  which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of per share of common stock the conversion rate will be subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events 
on or after july   the company may  under certain circumstances cause some or all of the series g preferred stock to be converted into shares of common stock at the then prevailing conversion rate 
further  if a fundamental change occurs  as defined in the articles supplementary for the series g preferred stock  then the holders may require essex to repurchase all or part of their series g preferred stock subject to certain conditions 
the exchange of the notes and or series g preferred stock for common stock would dilute stockholder ownership in the company  and such exchange could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities 
if the notes and series g preferred stock are not exchanged  the repurchase price of the notes and series g preferred stock may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of the holders of common stock 
further  these repurchase rights may be triggered in situations where essex needs to conserve its cash reserves  in which event such repurchase might adversely affect essex and its common stockholders 
our future issuances of common stock  preferred stock or convertible debt securities could adversely affect the market price of our common stock in order to finance our property acquisition and development activities  we have issued and sold common stock  preferred stock and convertible debt securities 
for example  in  the operating partnership sold million principal amount of exchangeable senior notes  which are exchangeable into the company s common stock under certain conditions 
in  the company issued  million shares of series g cumulative convertible preferred stock for gross proceeds of approximately million 
during  pursuant to a controlled equity offering program that the company entered into with cantor fitzgerald co  the company issued and sold approximately  shares of common stock for million  net of fees and commissions 
the company may in the future sell further shares of common stock pursuant to a controlled equity offering program with cantor fitzgerald co 
future sales of common stock  preferred stock or convertible debt securities may dilute stockholder ownership in the company and could adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our chairman is involved in other real estate activities and investments  which may lead to conflicts of interest our chairman  george m 
marcus is not an employee of essex  and is involved in other real estate activities and investments  which may lead to conflicts of interest 
mr 
marcus owns interests in various other real estate related businesses and investments 
he is the chairman of the marcus millichap company  or tmmc  which is a holding company for certain real estate brokerage and services companies 
tmmc has an interest in pacific property company  a company that invests in apartment communities 
mr 
marcus has agreed not to divulge any information that may be received by him in his capacity as chairman of essex to any of his affiliated companies and that he will abstain his vote on any and all resolutions by the essex board of directors regarding any proposed acquisition and or development of a multifamily property where it appears that there may be a conflict of interest with any of his affiliated companies 
notwithstanding this agreement  mr 
marcus and his affiliated entities may potentially compete with us in acquiring and or developing multifamily properties  which competition may be detrimental to us 
in addition  due to such potential competition for real estate investments  mr 
marcus and his affiliated entities may have a conflict of interest with us  which may be detrimental to the interests of essex s stockholders 
the influence of executive officers  directors and significant stockholders may be detrimental to holders of common stock as of december   george m 
marcus  the chairman of our board of directors  wholly or partially owned  shares of common stock including shares issuable upon exchange of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership and certain other partnerships and assuming exercise of all vested options 
this represents approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
mr 
marcus currently does not have majority control over us 
however  he currently has  and likely will continue to have  significant influence with respect to the election of directors and approval or disapproval of significant corporate actions 
consequently  his influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all our stockholders 
under the partnership agreement of the operating partnership  the consent of the holders of limited partnership interests is generally required for any amendment of the agreement and for certain extraordinary actions 
through their ownership of limited partnership interests and their positions with us  our directors and executive officers  including mr 
marcus  have substantial influence on us 
consequently  their influence could result in decisions that do not reflect the interests of all stockholders 
the voting rights of preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede actions that otherwise benefit holders of common stock in general  the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock do not have any voting rights 
however  if full distributions are not made on any outstanding preferred stock for six quarterly distributions periods  the holders of preferred stock who have not received distributions  voting together as a single class  will have the right to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors 
these voting rights continue until all distributions in arrears and distributions for the current quarterly period on the preferred stock have been paid in full 
at that time  the holders of the preferred stock are divested of these voting rights  and the term and office of the directors so elected immediately terminates 
while any shares of our preferred stock are outstanding  essex may not  without the consent of the holders of two thirds of the outstanding shares of each series of preferred stock  each voting separately as a single class authorize or create any class or series of stock that ranks senior to such preferred stock with respect to the payment of dividends  rights upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our business  amend  alter or repeal the provisions of essex s charter or bylaws  including by merger or consolidation  that would materially and adversely affect the rights of such series of preferred stock  or in the case of the preferred stock into which our preferred units are exchangeable  merge or consolidate with another entity or transfer substantially all of its assets to another entity  except if such preferred stock remains outstanding with the surviving entity and has the same terms and in certain other circumstances 
these voting rights of the preferred stock may allow holders of preferred stock to impede or veto actions that would otherwise benefit the holders of our common stock 
the redemption rights of the series b preferred units  series d preferred units  series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock may be detrimental to holders of essex common stock upon the occurrence of one of the following events  the terms of the operating partnership s series b and d preferred units require it to redeem all of such units and the terms of essex s series f preferred stock and the series g preferred stock provide the holders of the majority of the outstanding series f preferred stock and series g preferred stock the right to require essex to redeem all of such stock essex completes a going private transaction and its common stock is no longer registered under the securities exchange act of  as amended  essex completes a consolidation or merger or sale of substantially all of its assets and the surviving entity s debt securities do not possess an investment grade rating  essex fails to qualify as a reit  or in the case of series g preferred stock  essex common stock is not traded on a major exchange 
the aggregate redemption price of the series b preferred units would be million  the aggregate redemption price of the series d preferred units would be million  the aggregate redemption price of the series f preferred stock would be million and the aggregate redemption price of the series g preferred stock would be million  plus  in each case  any accumulated distributions 
these redemption rights may discourage or impede transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of holders of common stock 
further  these redemption rights might trigger situations where essex needs to conserve its cash reserves  in which event such redemption might adversely affect essex and its common holders 
maryland business combination law may not allow certain transactions between essex and its affiliates to proceed without compliance with such law under maryland law  business combinations between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder or an affiliate of an interested stockholder are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these business combinations include a merger  consolidation  share exchange  or  in circumstances specified in the statute  an asset transfer or issuance or reclassification of equity securities 
an interested stockholder is defined as any person and certain affiliates of such person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of the then outstanding voting stock 
the law also requires a supermajority stockholder vote for such transactions 
this means that the transaction must be approved by at least of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares  and two thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by holders of outstanding voting shares other than shares held by the interested stockholder with whom the business combination is to be effected 
the statute permits various exemptions from its provisions  including business combinations that are exempted by the board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
these voting provisions do not apply if the stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined under maryland law 
as permitted by the statute  the board of directors of essex irrevocably has elected to exempt any business combination by us  george m 
marcus  william a 
millichap  who are the chairman and a director of essex  respectively  and tmmc or any entity owned or controlled by messrs 
marcus and millichap and tmmc 
consequently  the five year prohibition and supermajority vote requirement described above will not apply to any business combination between us and mr 
marcus  mr 
millichap  or tmmc 
as a result  we may in the future enter into business combinations with messrs 
marcus and millichap and tmmc  without compliance with the supermajority vote requirements and other provisions of the maryland general corporation law 
anti takeover provisions contained in the operating partnership agreement  charter  bylaws  and certain provisions of maryland law could delay  defer or prevent a change in control while essex is the sole general partner of the operating partnership  and generally has full and exclusive responsibility and discretion in the management and control of the operating partnership  certain provisions of the operating partnership agreement place limitations on essex s ability to act with respect to the operating partnership 
such limitations could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of the stockholders or that could otherwise adversely affect the interest of essex s stockholders 
the partnership agreement provides that if the limited partners own at least of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership  essex cannot  without first obtaining the consent of a majority in interest of the limited partners in the operating partnership  transfer all or any portion of our general partner interest in the operating partnership to another entity 
such limitations on essex s ability to act may result in our being precluded from taking action that the board of directors believes is in the best interests of essex s stockholders 
as of december   the limited partners held or controlled approximately of the outstanding units of partnership interest in the operating partnership  allowing such actions to be blocked by the limited partners 
essex s charter authorizes the issuance of additional shares of common stock or preferred stock and the setting of the preferences  rights and other terms of such preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
we may establish one or more series of preferred stock that could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control 
such a transaction might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interests of the holders of common stock 
also  such a class of preferred stock could have dividend  voting or other rights that could adversely affect the interest of holders of common stock 
essex s charter  as well as essex s stockholder rights plan  contains other provisions that may delay  defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of essex s stockholders 
essex s stockholder rights plan is designed  among other things  to prevent a person or group from gaining control of us without offering a fair price to all of essex s stockholders 
the bylaws may be amended by the board of directors to include provisions that would have a similar effect  although essex presently has no such intention 
the charter contains ownership provisions limiting the transferability and ownership of shares of capital stock  which may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control 
for example  subject to receiving an exemption from the board of directors  potential acquirers may not purchase more than in value of the stock other than qualified pension trusts which can acquire 
this may discourage tender offers that may be attractive to the holders of common stock and limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock 
the maryland general corporations law restricts the voting rights of shares deemed to be control shares 
under the maryland general corporations law  control shares are those which  when aggregated with any other shares held by the acquirer  entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power within specified ranges 
although the bylaws exempt essex from the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law  the board of directors may amend or eliminate the provisions of the bylaws at any time in the future 
moreover  any such amendment or elimination of such provision of the bylaws may result in the application of the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law not only to control shares which may be acquired in the future  but also to control shares previously acquired 
if the provisions of the bylaws are amended or eliminated  the control share provisions of the maryland general corporations law could delay  defer or prevent a transaction or change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of essex s stockholders 
essex s joint ventures and joint ownership of properties and partial interests in corporations and limited partnerships could limit essex s ability to control such properties and partial interests instead of purchasing properties directly  we have invested and may continue to invest as a co venturer 
joint venturers often have shared control over the operation of the joint venture assets 
therefore  it is possible that the co venturer in an investment might become bankrupt  or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests  or our policies or objectives 
consequently  a co venturer s actions might subject property owned by the joint venture to additional risk 
although we seek to maintain sufficient influence over any joint venture to achieve its objectives  we may be unable to take action without our joint venture partners approval  or joint venture partners could take actions binding on the joint venture without our consent 
should a joint venture partner become bankrupt  we could become liable for such partner s share of joint venture liabilities 
from time to time  we  through the operating partnership  invest in corporations  limited partnerships  limited liability companies or other entities that have been formed for the purpose of acquiring  developing or managing real property 
in certain circumstances  the operating partnership s interest in a particular entity may be less than a majority of the outstanding voting interests of that entity 
therefore  the operating partnership s ability to control the daily operations of such an entity may be limited 
furthermore  the operating partnership may not have the power to remove a majority of the board of directors in the case of a corporation or the general partner or partners in the case of a limited partnership of such an entity in the event that its operations conflict with the operating partnership s objectives 
the operating partnership may not be able to dispose of its interests in such an entity 
in the event that such an entity becomes insolvent  the operating partnership may lose up to its entire investment in and any advances to the entity 
we have  and in the future may  enter into transactions that could require us to pay the tax liabilities of partners  which contribute assets into joint ventures or the operating partnership  in the event that certain taxable events  which are within our control  occur 
although we plan to hold the contributed assets or defer recognition of gain on their sale pursuant to the like kind exchange rules under section of the internal revenue code  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so and if such tax liabilities were incurred they can expect to have a material impact on our financial position 
dedicated investment activities and other factors specifically related to fund ii fund ii involves risks to us such as the following our partners in fund ii might remove essex as the general partner of fund ii  our partners in fund ii might become bankrupt in which event we might become generally liable for the liabilities of fund ii  our partners in fund ii might have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals  our partners in fund ii might fail to fund capital commitments as contractually required  or our partners in fund ii might fail to approve decisions regarding fund ii that are in our best interest 
we will  however  generally seek to maintain sufficient influence over fund ii to permit it to achieve its business objectives 
investments in mortgages and other real estate securities we may invest in securities related to real estate  which could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
we may purchase securities issued by entities which own real estate and invest in mortgages or unsecured debt obligations 
these mortgages may be first  second or third mortgages that may or may not be insured or otherwise guaranteed 
in general  investments in mortgages include the following risks that the value of mortgaged property may be less than the amounts owed  causing realized or unrealized losses  the borrower may not pay indebtedness under the mortgage when due  requiring us to foreclose  and the amount recovered in connection with the foreclosure may be less than the amount owed  that interest rates payable on the mortgages may be lower than our cost of funds  and in the case of junior mortgages  that foreclosure of a senior mortgage would eliminate the junior mortgage 
if any of the above were to occur  cash flows from operations and our ability to make expected dividends to stockholders could be adversely affected 
possible environmental liabilities under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  an owner or operator of real estate is liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances on  in  to or migrating from such property 
such laws often impose liability without regard as to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of such substances  or the failure to properly remediate such substances  may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent such property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
persons exposed to such substances  either through soil vapor or ingestion of the substances may claim personal injury damages 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility to which such substances or wastes were sent  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials acms into the air  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with acms 
in connection with the ownership direct or indirect  operation  management and development of real properties  the company could be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines and costs related to injuries of persons and property 
investments in real property create a potential for environmental liabilities on the part of the owner of such real property 
we carry certain limited insurance coverage for this type of environmental risk 
we have conducted environmental studies which revealed the presence of groundwater contamination at certain properties 
such contamination at certain of these properties was reported to have migrated on site from adjacent industrial manufacturing operations 
the former industrial users of the properties were identified as the source of contamination 
the environmental studies noted that certain properties are located adjacent to any possible down gradient from sites with known groundwater contamination  the lateral limits of which may extend onto such properties 
the environmental studies also noted that at certain of these properties  contamination existed because of the presence of underground fuel storage tanks  which have been removed 
in general  in connection with the ownership  operation  financing  management and development of real properties  we may be potentially liable for removal or clean up costs  as well as certain other costs and environmental liabilities 
we may also be subject to governmental fines and costs related to injuries to persons and property 
recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
essex has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some  but not all  such matters  which matters remain unresolved and pending 
insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates 
essex has  however  purchased pollution liability insurance  which includes limited coverage for mold  although the insurance may not cover all pending or future mold claims 
essex has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or the property 
essex cannot assure you that it will not be sued in the future for mold related matters and cannot assure you that the liabilities resulting from such current or future mold related matters will not be substantial 
the costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial 
california has enacted legislation commonly referred to as proposition requiring that clear and reasonable warnings be given to consumers who are exposed to chemicals known to the state of california to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity  including tobacco smoke 
although we have sought to comply with proposition requirements  we cannot assure you that we will not be adversely affected by litigation relating to proposition methane gas is a naturally occurring gas that is commonly found below the surface in several areas  particularly in the southern california coastal areas 
methane is a non toxic gas  but can be ignitable in confined spaces 
although naturally occurring  methane gas is not regulated at the state or federal level  some local governments  such as the county of los angeles  have imposed requirements that new buildings install detection systems in areas where methane gas is known to be located 
methane gas is also associated with certain industrial activities  such as former municipal waste landfills 
radon is also a naturally occurring gas that is found below the surface 
essex cannot assure you that it will not be adversely affected by costs related to its compliance with methane gas related requirements or litigation costs related to methane or radon gas 
the company has almost no indemnification agreements from third parties for potential environmental clean up costs at its properties 
the company has no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which it may be subject arising out of unknown environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties formerly owned by the company 
no assurance can be given that existing environmental studies with respect to any of the properties reveal all environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition not known to the company  or that a material environmental condition does not exist as to any one or more of the properties 
the company has limited insurance coverage for the types of environmental liabilities described above 
general uninsured losses the company carries comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance for each of the properties 
there are  however  certain types of extraordinary losses  such as  for example  losses for terrorism or earthquake  for which the company does not have insurance coverage 
substantially all of the properties are located in areas that are subject to earthquake activity 
in january  the company canceled the earthquake policy and established a wholly owned insurance subsidiary 
through this subsidiary  the company is self insured as it relates to earthquake related losses 
although the company may carry insurance for potential losses associated with its properties  employees  residents  and compliance with applicable laws  it may still incur losses due to uninsured risks  deductibles  co payments or losses in excess of applicable insurance coverage and those losses may be material 
changes in real estate tax and other laws generally we do not directly pass through costs resulting from changes in real estate tax laws to residential property tenants 
we also do not generally pass through increases in income  service or other taxes  to tenants under leases 
these costs may adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 
similarly  compliance with changes in i laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or the restrictions on discharges or other conditions or ii rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating housing may result in significant unanticipated expenditures  which would adversely affect funds from operations and the ability to make distributions to stockholders 
changes in financing policy  no limitation on debt we have adopted a policy of maintaining for a debt to total market capitalization ratio of less than 
the calculation of debt to total market capitalization is as follows total indebtedness divided by the sum of total indebtedness plus total equity market capitalization 
as used in this calculation  total equity market capitalization is equal to the aggregate market value of the outstanding shares of common stock based on the greater of current market price or the gross proceeds per share from public offerings of the outstanding shares plus any undistributed net cash flow  assuming the conversion of all limited partnership interests in the operating partnership into shares of common stock and the gross proceeds of the preferred units 
based on this calculation including the current market price and excluding undistributed net cash flow  our debt to total market capitalization ratio was approximately as of december  our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred 
accordingly  the board of directors of essex could change current policies and the policies of the operating partnership regarding indebtedness 
if we changed these policies  we could incur more debt  resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and the obligations of the operating partnership  and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
such increased debt could exceed the underlying value of the properties 
we are subject to certain tax risks essex has elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code 
essex s qualification as a reit requires it to satisfy numerous requirements some on an annual and quarterly basis established under highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations  and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within essex s control 
although essex intends that its current organization and method of operation enable it to qualify as a reit  it cannot assure you that it so qualifies or that it will be able to remain so qualified in the future 
future legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions any of which could have retroactive effect could adversely affect essex s ability to qualify as a reit or adversely affect its stockholders 
if it fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  essex would be subject to us federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at corporate rates  and would not be allowed to deduct dividends paid to its shareholders in computing its taxable income 
essex may also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year in which it failed to qualify 
the additional tax liability would reduce its net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders  and it would no longer be required to make distributions to its stockholders 
even if essex continues to qualify as a reit  it will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on its income and property 
essex has established several taxable reit subsidiaries trss 
despite essex s qualification as a reit  its trss must pay us federal income tax on their taxable income 
while essex will attempt to ensure that their dealing with its trss does not adversely affect its reit qualification  it cannot provide assurance that it will successfully achieve that result 
furthermore  essex may be subject to a penalty tax  or its trss may be denied deductions  to the extent its dealings with its trss are not deemed to be arm s length in nature 
no assurances can be given that essex s dealings with its trss will be arm s length in nature 
from time to time  we may transfer or otherwise dispose of some of our properties 
under the internal revenue code  any gain resulting from transfers of properties that we hold as inventory or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business would be treated as income from a prohibited transaction subject to a penalty tax 
since we acquire properties for investment purposes  we do not believe that our occasional transfers or disposals of property are prohibited transactions 
however  whether property is held for investment purposes is a question of fact that depends on all the facts and circumstances surrounding the particular transaction 
the internal revenue service may contend that certain transfers or disposals of properties by us are prohibited transactions 
if the internal revenue service were to argue successfully that a transfer or disposition of property constituted a prohibited transaction  then essex would be required to pay a penalty tax on any gain allocable to essex from the prohibited transaction and essex s ability to retain future gains on real property sales may be jeopardized 
income from a prohibited transaction might adversely affect essex s ability to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit for us federal income tax purposes 
therefore  no assurances can be given that essex will be able to satisfy the income tests for qualification as a reit

item properties our core apartment portfolio as of december  including partial ownership interests was comprised of apartment communities comprising  apartment units  of which  units are located in southern california   units are located in the san francisco bay area   units are located in the seattle metropolitan area  and  units are located in the other areas including portland  oregon and houston  texas 
the company s apartment communities accounted for of the company s property revenues for the year ended december  occupancy rates the apartment communities had an average same properties occupancy as defined in item  based on financial occupancy  during the year ended december   of approximately 
with respect to stabilized apartment communities with sufficient operating history  occupancy figures are based on financial occupancy the percentage resulting from dividing actual rental revenue by total possible rental revenue 
actual rental revenue represents contractual revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions 
total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units  with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents 
we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 
financial occupancy may not completely reflect short term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy 
as of december   the headquarters building was occupied by the company and the southern california office building was occupied  based on physical occupancy 
with respect to office buildings  occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied square footage by rentable square footage 
with respect to recreational vehicle parks  manufactured housing communities  or apartment communities which have not yet stabilized or have insufficient operating history  occupancy figures are based on physical occupancy which refers to the percentage resulting from dividing leased and occupied units by rentable units 
for the year ended december   none of the company s properties had book values equal to or more of total assets of the company or gross revenues equal to or more of aggregate gross revenues of the company 
apartment communities our apartment communities are generally suburban garden apartments and town homes comprising multiple clusters of two and three story buildings situated on three to fifteen acres of land 
the apartment communities have on average of units  with a mix of studio  one  two and some three bedroom units 
a wide variety of amenities are available at each apartment community  including covered parking  fireplaces  swimming pools  clubhouses with complete fitness facilities  volleyball and playground areas and tennis courts 
we select  train and supervise a full team of on site service and maintenance personnel 
we believe that the following primary factors enhance our ability to retain tenants well built communities that have been well maintained since acquisition  and proactive customer service approach 
office buildings the company s corporate headquarters is located in a two story office building with approximately  square feet located at east meadow drive  palo alto  california 
the company acquired this property in the company also owns an office building in southern california woodland hills  comprised of approximately  square feet building  of which the company occupies approximately  square feet at december  the building has nine third party tenants occupying approximately  feet 
the largest single tenant occupies approximately  square feet 
the company acquired the woodland hills property in the company has a mortgage loan receivable on an office building with approximately  square feet located in irvine  california  which is consolidated under fin r

recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of apartment communities alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
the company has been sued for mold related matters and has settled some  but not all  of such matters 
insurance carriers have reacted to mold related liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates

the company has adopted programs designed to manage the existence of mold in its properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on residents or property 
liabilities resulting from such mold related matters and the costs of carrying insurance to address potential mold related claims may also be substantial 
the company is subject to various other lawsuits in the normal course of its business operations

the company believes that the interest coverage ratio is useful to readers because it is frequently used by investors  lenders  security analysts and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
in addition  the company believes that this ratio is useful in evaluating our performance compared to that of other companies in our industry because the calculation of the adjusted ebitda component of the interest coverage ratio generally eliminates the effects of financing costs  income taxes  and depreciation and amortization  which items may vary for different companies for reasons unrelated to operating performance 
the adjusted ebitda component of the interest coverage ratio  however  is not a recognized measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
when analyzing our operating performance  readers should use the interest coverage ratio and its adjusted ebitda component in addition to  and not as an alternative for  net income  as determined in accordance with gaap 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our presentation of the interest coverage ratio and its adjusted ebitda component may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
furthermore  the interest coverage ratio is not intended to be a measure of free cash flow for our management s discretionary use  as it does not consider certain cash requirements such as income tax payments  debt service requirements  capital expenditures and other fixed charges 
the amounts shown for the interest coverage ratio and adjusted ebitda may also differ from the amounts calculated under similarly titled definitions in our debt instruments  which can be further adjusted to reflect certain other cash and non cash charges and are used to determine compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain restricted payments 
gross operating margin represents rental revenues and other property income less property operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  divided by rental revenues and other property income 
a stabilized apartment community  or same property apartment units as defined in item  are those units in properties that the company has consolidated for the entire two years as of the end of the period set forth

percentage changes in averages per unit do not correspond to total same property revenues and expense percentage changes which are discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
average same property monthly rental rate per apartment unit represents total scheduled rent for the same property apartment units for the period actual rental rates on occupied apartment units plus market rental rates on vacant apartment units divided by the number of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months in the period 
average same property monthly expenses per apartment unit represents total monthly operating expenses  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  for the same property apartment units for the period divided by the total number of such apartment units and further divided by the number of months in the period

for an explanation of how financial occupancy is calculated  see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
these consolidated financial statements include all adjustments which are  in the opinion of management  necessary to reflect a fair statement of the results and all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature

as of december   we had ownership interests in apartment communities  comprising  apartment units 
our apartment communities are located in the following major west coast regions southern california los angeles  ventura  orange  riverside and san diego counties northern california the san francisco bay area seattle metro seattle metropolitan area other regions portland metropolitan area  houston  texas  and property owned by a trs as of december   we also had ownership interests in three office buildings with approximately  square feet  two recreational vehicle parks comprising spaces and one manufactured housing community containing sites

actual rental revenue represents contractual rental revenue pursuant to leases without considering delinquency and concessions 
total possible rental revenue represents the value of all apartment units  with occupied units valued at contractual rental rates pursuant to leases and vacant units valued at estimated market rents 
we believe that financial occupancy is a meaningful measure of occupancy because it considers the value of each vacant unit at its estimated market rate 
financial occupancy may not completely reflect short term trends in physical occupancy and financial occupancy rates as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation of financial occupancy

many of the company s properties are older and in excellent neighborhoods  providing lower density with large floor plans that represent attractive redevelopment opportunities 
during redevelopment  apartment units may not be available for rent and  as a result  may have less than stabilized operations 
as of december   the company had ownership interests in twelve major redevelopment communities aggregating  apartment units with estimated redevelopment costs of million  of which approximately million remains to be expended 
these amounts exclude redevelopment projects owned by fund ii 
alternative capital sources fund ii has eight institutional investors  including the company  with combined partner equity commitments of million 
essex has committed million to fund ii  which represents a interest as general partner and limited partner 
fund ii expects to utilize leverage equal to approximately of the estimated value of the underlying real estate 
fund ii invests in apartment communities in the company s targeted west coast markets with an emphasis on investment opportunities in the seattle metropolitan area and the san francisco bay area 
subject to certain exceptions  fund ii has been essex s primary investment vehicle during and as of october  fund ii was fully invested and closed for any future acquisitions or development 
as of december   fund ii owned apartment communities and three development projects 
consistent with fund i  essex records revenue for its asset management  property management  development and redevelopment services when earned  and promote income if fund ii exceeds certain financial return benchmarks 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes the maturation or due dates of our contractual obligations and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations could have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods and and in thousands thereafter total mortgage notes payable exchangeable bonds lines of credit interest on indebtedness development commitments redevelopment commitments essex apartment value fund ii  lp capital commitment variable interest entities consolidated variable interest entities in accordance fin r  the company consolidates down reit limited partnerships comprising ten properties  an office building that is subject to loans made by the company  and building improvements owned by a third party in which the company owns the land underlying the improvements and from which the company receives land lease payments  subordination  and property management fees 
the company consolidated these entities because it is deemed the primary beneficiary under fin r 
the company s total assets and liabilities related to these variable interest entities vies  net of intercompany eliminations  were approximately million and million  respectively  at december  and million and million  respectively  at december  interest holders in vies consolidated by the company are allocated net income equal to the cash payments made to those interest holders for services rendered or distributions from cash flow 
the remaining results of operations are generally allocated to the company 
properties consolidated in accordance with fin r were encumbered by third party  non recourse loans totaling million and million as of december  and  respectively 
unconsolidated variable interest entities as of december  the company is involved with two vies  of which it is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary 
total assets and liabilities of these entities as of december  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company does not have a significant exposure to loss resulting from its involvement with these unconsolidated vies 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we define critical accounting policies as those accounting policies that require our management to exercise their most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
our critical accounting policies relate principally to the following key areas i consolidation under applicable accounting standards of various entities  ii assessing the carrying values of our real estate properties and investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  and iii internal cost capitalization 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates made by management 
the company assesses each entity in which it has an investment or contractual relationship to determine if it may be deemed to be a vie 
if such an entity is a vie  then the company analyzes the expected losses and expected residual returns to determine who is the primary beneficiary 
if the company is the primary beneficiary  then the entity is consolidated 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and judgmental  and the analysis must be applied to various types of entities and legal structures 
rental properties are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation components on rental properties have been provided over estimated useful lives ranging from to years using the straight line method 
development costs include acquisition  direct and indirect construction costs  interest and real estate taxes incurred during the construction and property stabilizations periods 
maintenance and repair expenses that do not add to the value or prolong the useful life of the property are expensed as incurred 
asset replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company assesses the carrying value of its real estate investments by monitoring investment market conditions and performance compared to budget for operating properties and joint ventures  and by monitoring estimated costs for properties under development 
local market knowledge and data is used to assess carrying values of properties and the market value of acquisition opportunities 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property held for investment may not be fully recoverable  the carrying amount is evaluated 
if the sum of the property s expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying amount of the property  then the company will recognize an impairment loss equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the property 
adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of real estate investments could result in impairment charges 
when the company determines that a property is held for sale  it discontinues the periodic depreciation of that property 
the criteria for determining when a property is held for sale requires judgment and has potential financial statement impact as depreciation would cease and an impairment loss could occur upon determination of held for sale status 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell 
with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures and affiliates  the company looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge or investment valuation charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
the company capitalizes all direct and certain indirect costs  including interest and real estate taxes  incurred during development and redevelopment activities 
interest is capitalized on real estate assets that require a period of time to get them ready for their intended use 
the amount of interest capitalized is based upon the average amount of accumulated development expenditures during the reporting period 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of the direct and incremental personnel costs and indirect project costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
indirect project costs consist primarily of personnel costs associated with construction administration and development accounting  legal fees  and various office costs that clearly relate to projects under development 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may vary from those estimates and those estimates could be different under different assumptions or conditions 
forward looking statements certain statements in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this annual report on form k which are not historical facts may be considered forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities and exchange act of  as amended  including statements regarding the company s expectations  hopes  intentions  beliefs and strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding the company s expectations as to the timing of completion of current development and redevelopment projects and the stabilization dates of such projects  expectation as to the total projected costs and rental rates of development and redevelopment projects  beliefs as to the adequacy of future cash flows to meet operating requirements and to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements  expectations as to the amount of capital expenditures  expectations as to the amount of non revenue generating capital expenditures  future acquisitions  the company s anticipated development projects in  the anticipated performance of the second essex apartment value fund fund ii  the anticipated performance of existing properties  anticipated results from various geographic regions and the company s investment focus in such regions  statements regarding the company s financing activities  and the use of proceeds from such activities 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors including  but not limited to  that the company will fail to achieve its business objectives  that the actual completion of development projects will be subject to delays  that the stabilization dates of such projects will be delayed  that the total projected costs of current development projects will exceed expectations  that the company s development strategy will change  that such development projects will not be completed  that development projects and acquisitions will fail to meet expectations  that estimates of future income from an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate  that future cash flows will be inadequate to meet operating requirements and or will be insufficient to provide for dividend payments in accordance with reit requirements  that the actual non revenue generating capital expenditures will exceed the company s current expectations  that there may be a downturn in the markets in which the company s properties are located  that the terms of any refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness  as well as those risks  special considerations  and other factors discussed under the caption potential factors affecting future operating results below and those discussed in item a  risk factors  of this form k  and those risk factors and special considerations set forth in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec which may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company to be materially different from any future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
all forward looking statements are made as of today  and the company assumes no obligation to update this information 
potential factors affecting future operating results many factors affect the company s actual financial performance and may cause the company s future results to be different from past performance or trends 
these factors include those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a 
of this annual report on form k and the following development and redevelopment activities the company pursues multifamily residential properties and development and redevelopment projects from time to time 
these projects generally require various government and other approvals  the receipt of which cannot be assured 
the company s development and redevelopment activities generally entail certain risks  including the following funds may be expended and management s time devoted to projects that may not be completed  construction costs of a project may exceed original estimates possibly making the project economically unfeasible  projects may be delayed due to  among other things  adverse weather conditions  occupancy rates and rents at a completed project may be less than anticipated  and expenses at a completed development project may be higher than anticipated 
these risks may reduce the funds available for distribution to the company s stockholders 
further  the development and redevelopment of properties is also subject to the general risks associated with real estate investments 
interest rate fluctuations the company monitors changes in interest rates and believes that it is well positioned from both a liquidity and interest rate risk perspective 
however  current interest rates are at historic lows and potentially could increase rapidly to levels more in line with higher historical levels 
the immediate effect of significant and rapid interest rate increases would result in higher interest expense on the company s variable interest rate debt 
the effect of prolonged interest rate increases could negatively impact the company s ability to make acquisitions and develop properties at economic returns on investment and the company s ability to refinance existing borrowings at acceptable rates 
funds from operations ffo ffo is a financial measure that is commonly used in the reit industry 
essex presents funds from operations as a supplemental performance measure 
ffo is not used by essex  nor should it be considered to be  as an alternative to net earnings computed under gaap as an indicator of essex s operating performance or as an alternative to cash from operating activities computed under gaap as an indicator of essex s ability to fund its cash needs 
ffo is not meant to represent a comprehensive system of financial reporting and does not present  nor does essex intend it to present  a complete picture of its financial condition and operating performance 
essex believes that net earnings computed under gaap remains the primary measure of performance and that ffo is only meaningful when it is used in conjunction with net earnings 
further  essex believes that its consolidated financial statements  prepared in accordance with gaap  provide the most meaningful picture of its financial condition and its operating performance 
in calculating ffo  essex follows the definition for this measure published by the national association of reits nareit  which is a reit trade association 
essex believes that  under the nareit ffo definition  the two most significant adjustments made to net income are i the exclusion of historical cost depreciation and ii the exclusion of gains and losses from the sale of previously depreciated properties 
essex agrees that these two nareit adjustments are useful to investors for the following reasons a historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap assumes  through depreciation charges  that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
nareit stated in its white paper on funds from operations since real estate asset values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
consequently  nareit s definition of ffo reflects the fact that real estate  as an asset class  generally appreciates over time and depreciation charges required by gaap do not reflect the underlying economic realities 
b reits were created as a legal form of organization in order to encourage public ownership of real estate as an asset class through investment in firms that were in the business of long term ownership and management of real estate 
the exclusion  in nareit s definition of ffo  of gains and losses from the sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the long term assets that form the core of a reit s activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
management has consistently applied the nareit definition of ffo to all periods presented 
however  other reits in calculating ffo may vary from the nareit definition for this measure  and thus their disclosure of ffo may not be comparable to essex s calculation 
the following table sets forth the company s calculation of ffo for and in thousands except for per share data 
for the year ended for the quarter ended net income available to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization gains not included in ffo minority interests and co investments funds from operations weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted for the year ended for the quarter ended net income available to common stockholders adjustments depreciation and amortization gains not included in ffo minority interests and co investments funds from operations weighted average number of shares outstanding diluted amount includes gain equivalent to accumulated depreciation on peregrine point condominium sales

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate hedging activities the company s objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage its exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  the company primarily uses interest rate swaps as part of its cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
as of december   we have entered into nine forward starting swap contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in the interest related cash outflows on forecasted issuance of long term debt 
the forward starting swaps are cash flow hedges of the variability in ten years of forecasted interest payments associated with the refinancing of the company s long term debt between and as of december   the company also had million of variable rate indebtedness  of which million is subject to interest rate cap protection 
all of our derivative instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  and the company does not have any fair value hedges as of december  the following table summarizes the notional amount  carrying value  and estimated fair value of our derivative instruments used to hedge interest rates as of december  the notional amount represents the aggregate amount of a particular security that is currently hedged at one time  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rates or market risks 
the table also includes a sensitivity analysis to demonstrate the impact on our derivative instruments from an increase or decrease in libor by basis points  as of december  carrying and notional maturity estimate fair libor libor dollars in thousands amount date range value basis points basis points cash flow hedges interest rate forward starting swaps interest rate caps total cash flow hedges interest rate sensitive liabilities the company is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of its line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and fund capital expenditures and expansion of the company s real estate investment portfolio and operations 
the company s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives the company borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
the company does not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the company s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows 
management believes that the carrying amounts of its libor debt approximates fair value as of december  because interest rates  yields and other terms for these instruments are consistent with yields and other terms currently available to the company for similar instruments 
management has estimated that the fair value of the company s billion of fixed rate mortgage notes payable and exchangeable bonds at december  is approximately billion based on the terms of existing mortgage notes payable compared to those available in the marketplace 
for the years ended december thereafter total fair value in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate variable rate libor debt average interest rate million covered by a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before october  million covered by a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before october  also  million covered by a forward starting swap at a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before january  million covered by three forward starting swaps with fixed rates ranging from to  with a settlement date on or before january  million covered by forward starting swaps with fixed rates ranging from to  with a settlement date on or before february  million covered by a forward starting swap with a fixed rate of  with a settlement date on or before july  the company intends to encumber certain unencumbered assets during in conjunction with the settlement of these forward starting swaps 
 subject to interest rate caps 
the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss  with respect to interest rate fluctuations  would depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at the time  and interest rates
