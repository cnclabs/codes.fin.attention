item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected historical financial and operating data and our consolidated combined financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fully integrated hospitality company that operates  owns  acquires  develops and redevelops boutique hotels in gateway cities and select resort markets in the united states and europe 
we are widely credited with establishing and defining the rapidly expanding boutique hotel sector 
over our year history  we have gained experience operating in a variety of market conditions 
at december   we owned or partially owned and managed a portfolio of ten luxury hotel properties in new york  miami  los angeles  scottsdale  san francisco and london comprising over  rooms 
each of our owned hotels was acquired and renovated by the morgans group  or an affiliate  and was designed by a world renowned designer 
unlike traditional brand managed or franchised hotels  boutique hotels provide their guests with what we believe is a distinctive lodging experience 
each of our hotels has a personality specifically tailored to reflect the local market environment and features modern  sophisticated design that includes critically acclaimed public spaces  popular destination bars and restaurants  and highly personalized service 
significant media attention has been devoted to our hotels which we believe is as a result of their distinctive nature  renowned design  dynamic and exciting atmosphere  celebrity guests and high profile events 
we believe that the morgans hotel group brand  and each of our individual property brands are synonymous with style  innovation and service 
we believe this combination of lodging and social experiences  and association with our brands  increases our occupancy levels and pricing power 
in addition to our current portfolio  we expect to operate  own  acquire  redevelop and develop new hotel properties that are consistent with our portfolio in major metropolitan cities and select resort markets in the united states  europe and elsewhere 
we were incorporated as a delaware corporation in october to acquire  own  and manage boutique hotels in the united states  europe and elsewhere 
as of december   we owned seven hotels in new york  miami  los angeles  san francisco and scottsdale  comprising approximately  rooms  a building adjacent to delano miami which we intend to convert into a new hotel with guest facilities  a interest in two hotels in london comprising approximately rooms and a interest in the room shore club in miami  all of which we also manage  and a interest in an apartment building on biscayne bay in south beach miami which we are redeveloping and have rebranded under our mondrian brand as a hotel and condominium project under the name mondrian south beach hotel residences 
we conduct our operations through our operating company  morgans group llc  which holds all of our assets 
we are the managing member of morgans group llc and hold approximately of its membership units at december  we manage all aspects of morgans group llc including the operation  investment and sale and purchase of hotels and the financing of morgans group llc 
the historical financial data presented herein is the historical financial data for our owned hotels  our joint venture hotels  our management company subsidiary  mhg management company  and the rights and obligations of morgans hotel group llc contributed to morgans group llc in the formation and structuring transactions described above 
we consolidate the results of operations for all of our owned hotels 
certain food and beverage operations at five of our owned hotels are operated under joint ventures with restaurateur jeffrey chodorow 
the asia de cuba restaurant at mondrian scottsdale is operated under license and management agreements with china grill management  the company controlled by jeffrey chodorow 
we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of these entities because we absorb the majority of any restaurant ventures expected losses or residual returns 
therefore  these restaurant ventures are consolidated in our financial statements with our partner s share of the results of operations recorded as minority interest in the accompanying consolidated combined financial statements 
this minority interest is based upon of the income of the venture after giving effect to rent and other administrative charges payable to the hotel 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and certain food and beverage operations at two of the joint venture hotels 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net losses and distributions 
on february   we began managing the hotel operations at the hard rock hotel casino in las vegas 
we will also manage the mondrian south beach once redevelopment is complete 
as of december   we operated joint venture hotels under management agreements which expire as follows sanderson april with two ten year extensions at our option st 
martins lane september with two ten year extensions at our option shore club july we generated net losses for the years ended december   and revenues increased by million in compared to and by million in compared to the loss for the year ended december  is primarily due to non cash charges related to income taxes and stock compensation 
the increase in the company s income tax expense is a result of our conversion from a partnership to a c corporation in february in connection with our ipo and the recording of basis differences in our assets and liabilities at the time 
stock compensation expense realized in is a result of restricted shares  long term incentive plan units and stock options granted to employees and directors in connection with the ipo 
income tax expense increased million in compared to and stock compensation expense increased million in compared to the loss for the year ended december  was primarily due to our interest expense exceeding our operating income 
interest expense increased by million in compared to primarily due to the write off of deferred financing costs due to the refinancing of the debt on our five jointly financed united states hotel properties morgans  royalton  hudson  delano miami and mondrian los angeles  prepayment fees from the june refinancing of the debt on those five hotels and increased interest expense on mortgage debt due to additional mortgage debt on those five hotels 
with the refinancing of our debt on our five jointly financed united states hotel properties in june and then again in october  and after giving effect to the formation and structuring transactions  we experienced a reduction of million in our interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to december  we anticipate that the refinancing of the same debt in october will reduce interest expense during as well 
factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
changes in our revenues are most easily explained by three performance indicators that are commonly used in the hospitality industry occupancy  adr  and revenue per available room  or revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but  however  does not include food and beverage revenue  other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  or management fee revenue 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the operation of our hotels 
specifically  our revenue consists of rooms revenue 
occupancy and adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
most of our food and beverage revenue is earned by our joint ventures and is driven by occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our bars and restaurants with our local customers 
other hotel revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue such as telephone  parking  spa  entertainment and other guest services  are principally driven by hotel occupancy 
management fee related parties revenue 
we earn fees under our management agreements that total of defined revenues of shore club  of the defined revenues for our two london properties  and beginning february   of defined non gaming revenues  including casino rents and all other income  for hard rock 
in addition  we are reimbursed for allocated chain services  which include certain overhead costs for the hotels that we manage and which are currently recovered at approximately of defined revenues of the hotels we manage and of defined revenues at hard rock 
fluctuations in revenues  which tend to correlate with changes in gross domestic product  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions but can also be impacted by major events  such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
the seasonal nature of the hospitality business can also impact revenues 
we experience some seasonality in our business  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates and occupancy tend to fall when supply increases unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we focus on boutique hotels in key gateway cities is because these markets have significant barriers to entry for new competitive supply  including scarcity of available land for new development and extensive regulatory requirements resulting in a longer development lead time and additional expense for new competitors 
a recent trend among hotel owners is the conversion of hotel rooms to condominium apartments which further reduces the available supply of hotel rooms resulting in increased demand for the remaining hotels 
finally  competition within the hospitality industry can affect revenues 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property  pricing  and range and quality of food services and amenities offered 
in addition  all of our hotels  restaurants and bars are located in areas where there are numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services  including rooms expense 
rooms expense includes the payroll and benefits for the front office  housekeeping  concierge and reservations departments and related expenses  such as laundry  rooms supplies  travel agent commissions and reservation expense 
like rooms revenue  occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 
food and beverage expense 
similar to food and beverage revenue  occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our restaurants and bars are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expense 
occupancy is the major driver of other departmental expense  which includes telephone and other expenses related to the generation of other hotel revenue 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense consist of administrative and general expenses  such as payroll and related costs  travel expenses and office rent  advertising and promotion expenses  comprising the payroll of the hotel sales teams  the global sales team and advertising  marketing and promotion expenses for our hotel properties  utility expense and repairs and maintenance expenses comprising the ongoing costs to repair and maintain our hotel properties 
property taxes  insurance and other consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
corporate expenses consist of the cost of our corporate office  net of any cost recoveries  which consists primarily of payroll and related costs  office rent and legal and professional fees and costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization expense 
hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
other items interest expense  net 
includes interest on our debt and amortization of financing costs and is reduced by interest income 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures constitutes our share of the net profits and losses of our united kingdom hotel joint venture  our united kingdom food and beverage joint venture both of which are owned by us  shore club in which we have a ownership interest  and since august   mondrian south beach in which we have a ownership interest and which is currently operating as an apartment building 
minority interest 
minority interest expense constitutes the third party food and beverage joint venture partner s interest in the profits of the restaurant ventures at certain of our hotels 
other non operating income expenses include gains and losses on sale of assets and asset restructurings  costs of abandoned development projects and financings  gain on early extinguishment of debt and other items that do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of our assets 
income tax expense 
the united states entities included in our predecessor s combined financial statements are either partnerships or limited liability companies  which are treated similarly to partnerships for tax reporting purposes 
accordingly  federal and state income taxes have not been provided for in the accompanying combined financial statements for the years ended december  and as the partners or members are responsible for reporting their allocable share of our predecessor s income  gains  deductions  losses and credits on their individual income tax returns 
one of our foreign subsidiaries is subject to united kingdom corporate income taxes 
income tax expense is reported at the applicable rate for the periods presented 
certain of our predecessor s subsidiaries are subject to the new york city unincorporated business tax ubt 
income tax expense in our predecessor s financial statements comprises the income taxes paid in the united kingdom on the management fees earned by our wholly owned united kingdom subsidiary 
subsequent to the ipo  the company is subject to federal and state income taxes 
income taxes for the period from february  to december  were computed using the company s calculated effective tax rate 
the company also recorded net deferred taxes related to cumulative differences in the basis recorded for certain assets and liabilities in the amount of million at the time of our conversion from a partnership to a c corporation 
most categories of variable operating expenses  such as operating supplies and certain labor such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses 
increases in revpar attributable to improvements in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  primarily credit card and travel agent commissions 
thus  improvements in adr have a more significant impact on improving our operating margins than occupancy 
notwithstanding our efforts to reduce variable costs  there are limits to how much we can accomplish because we have significant fixed costs  such as depreciation and amortization  labor costs and employee benefits  insurance  real estate taxes and other expenses associated with owning hotels that do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in our hotel revenues 
recent trends and developments recent trends 
generally  lodging demand in the united states has remained robust through  driven by continued strength associated with business and leisure travelers  while lodging supply growth continued to remain low 
the hospitality industry  particularly in the united states began to recover in the fourth quarter of from the severe downturn that started in early  which was precipitated by the recession of the united states economy and was exacerbated by the dramatic decline in travel following the terrorist acts of september  we believe that  in general  current industry fundamentals are similar to those observed following the last industry downturn  which occurred in the early s 
that downturn  which also resulted from a recession in the general economy  was followed by several years of revpar growth 
we believe that  given the fact that supply growth is lower than it was in the prior recovery and the united states economy remains strong  occupancy and adr will continue the improvement  and that united states hospitality revpar will follow the business cycle on its upward swing  although there can be no assurances that such improvements will occur 
the london hospitality market experienced very strong growth in due to the strength of the united kingdom economy  citywide events and the recovery from the terrorist attacks which occurred in the city in july recent developments 
in addition to the recent trends described above  we expect that the following events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance 
formation and structuring transactions 
the following items associated with the consummation of the formation and structuring transactions described above under business corporate structure formation and structuring transactions and our ipo have affected our year ended december  results of operations for the fiscal year ended december  and we believe will continue to affect our results of operations in the foreseeable future as a result of the refinancing of existing debt obligations  interest expense declined 
this decline was evident in the results of operations for the year ended december   as the interest expense decreased by million as compared to the same period ended december  as a result of stock based compensation issued in connection with our ipo  we began recording stock based compensation expense during the year ended december  we became subject to federal and state income taxes  resulting in the company recording income tax expense of million for the year ended december  acquisitions and developments

recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the assets 
in this analysis of fair value  we use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of our properties taking into account each property s expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
the factors we address in determining estimated net proceeds from disposition include anticipated operating cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal capitalization rate and selling price per room 
our judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  the growth rate of the properties  the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the classification of these assets as held for sale requires the recording of these assets at our estimate of their fair value less estimated selling costs which can affect the amount of impairment recorded 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
the respective lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions made by us  including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
hotel properties and other completed real estate investments are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
while our management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels or other assets 
we have not changed the estimated useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities require us to make judgments on the nature of our derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported as a component of interest expense in the consolidated combined statements of operations or as a component of equity on the consolidated combined balance sheets 
while we believe our judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s fair value or effectiveness as a hedge could affect expenses  net income and equity 
consolidation policy 
we evaluate our variable interests in accordance with financial interpretation r to determine if they are variable interests in variable interest entities 
certain food and beverage operations at five of our owned hotels are operated under joint ventures 
we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of the entities because we absorb the majority of the restaurant ventures expected losses and residual returns 
therefore  the restaurant ventures are consolidated in our financial statements with our partner s share of the results of operations recorded as minority interest in the accompanying financial statements 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and certain food and beverage operations at two of the joint venture hotels 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net loss and distributions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
some of our outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial results of operations derivative financial instruments above  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   our total outstanding debt  including capitalized lease obligations  was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
our agreement caps libor at and expires in july at december   the libor rate was  thereby making our cap in the money 
an increase in market rates of interest will not impact our interest expense 
if market rates of interest increase by  or approximately basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  or approximately basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt would increase by million 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments and future cash flows 
these analyses do not consider the effect of a reduced level of overall economic activity 
if overall economic activity is significantly reduced  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure 
however  because we cannot determine the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
currency exchange risk as we have international operations with our two london hotels  currency exchange risk between the us dollar and the british pound arises as a normal part of our business 
we reduce this risk by transacting this business in british pounds 
we have not repatriated earnings from our london hotels because of our historical net losses in our united kingdom operations and our joint venture agreement 
as a result  any funds repatriated from the united kingdom are considered a return of capital and require court approval 
we may consider repatriating certain funds in a change in prevailing rates would have  however  an impact on the value of our equity in morgans hotel group europe limited 
the us dollar british pound currency exchange is currently the only currency exchange rate to which we are directly exposed 
generally  we do not enter into forward or option contracts to manage our exposure applicable to net operating cash flows 
we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future
