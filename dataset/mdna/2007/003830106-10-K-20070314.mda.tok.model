item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior to february  grey wolf exploration inc was a wholly owned canadian subsidiary of abraxas 
in february  grey wolf closed on an initial public offering resulting in the substantial divestiture of our capital stock in grey wolf 
as a result of the grey wolf ipo  and the significant divestiture of our interest in grey wolf  the results of operations of grey wolf are reflected in our financial statements and in this document as discontinued operations and our remaining operations are referred to in our financial statements and in this document as continuing operations or continued operations 
unless otherwise noted  all disclosures are for continuing operations 
the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of continuing operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item general we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the development  and production of natural gas and crude oil 
historically  we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploration of producing properties  principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as d seismic surveys and horizontal drilling 
as a result of these activities  we believe that we have a substantial inventory of development opportunities  which provide a basis for significant production and reserve increases 
in addition  we intend to expand upon our development activities with complementary exploration projects in our core areas of operation 
while we have attained positive net income from continuing operations in three of the last five years  there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following o the sales prices of natural gas and crude oil  o the level of total sales volumes of natural gas and crude oil  o the availability of  and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet  cash flow needs  o the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and o the level and success of exploration and development activity 
commodity prices and hedging activities 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our natural gas and crude oil production 
substantially all of our sales of natural gas and crude oil are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our natural gas and crude oil production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
significant declines in prices for natural gas and crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
recently  the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been volatile 
during the first half of  prices for natural gas and crude oil were sustained at record or near record levels 
supply and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in significant price volatility during the remainder of with both natural gas and crude oil prices weakening 
new york mercantile exchange nymex futures prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil averaged per barrel for the year  with a low price of about per barrel occurring in the fourth quarter of us natural gas pricing declined during nymex henry hub futures prices averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu during as compared to per mmbtu during the natural gas market continues to be driven by high natural gas storage inventories and mild early winter conditions for much of the country 
nymex natural gas prices ended the year at about per mmbtu 
the outlook for the commodity markets in calls for continued volatility 
we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through price floors 
in we incurred a hedging loss of  for the years ended december  and we recognized gains from hedging activities of approximately  and  respectively 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our natural gas and crude oil production  on an equivalent basis  for a rolling six month period 
we currently have the following hedges in place caption time period notional quantities price 
del april  mmbtu of production per day floor of may  mmbtu of production per day floor of june  mmbtu of production per day floor of july  mmbtu of production per day floor of august  mmbtu of production per day floor of september  mmbtu of production per day floor of del 
at december  the aggregate fair market value of our hedges was approximately  production volumes 
because our proved reserves will decline as natural gas and crude oil are produced  unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploration and development projects 
we had capital expenditures for of million and have a capital budget for ranging from to million in  the exact amount of which will depend on our success rate  production levels and commodity prices 
during  our production volumes increased by over availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  our sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under our revolving credit facility  cash on hand  and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
we currently have approximately million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we may also seek equity capital in order to fund our planned drilling expenditures 
exploration and development activity 
we believe that our high quality asset base  high degree of operational control and large inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth 
our properties are concentrated in locations that facilitate substantial economies of scale in drilling and production operations and more efficient reservoir management practices 
we operate of the properties accounting for approximately of our pv  giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures 
in addition  we have proved undeveloped projects and have identified over drilling and recompletion opportunities on our existing acreage  the successful development of which we believe could significantly increase our daily production and proved reserves 
our future natural gas and crude oil production  and therefore our success  is highly dependent upon our ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from our natural gas and crude oil properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful development and exploration activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that our exploration and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves 
for example  in  while we have had some success in pursuing these activities  we were not able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
if our proved reserves continue to decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our revolving credit facility will also decline 
in addition  approximately of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
for a more complete discussion of these risks please see risk factors we may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves  in which case our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
borrowings and interest 
we currently have indebtedness of approximately million and availability of million under the revolving credit facility 
cash interest expense was million during and based on current interest rates and our outstanding indebtedness at march   would be approximately million for this increase in cash interest expense resulted in a larger percentage of our production and cash flow from operations being used to meet our debt service requirements 
as a result  we will need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
results of operations selected operating data

comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from natural gas and crude oil sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased production volumes in as compared to offset by lower natural gas prices realized in as compared to higher production volumes contributed million to natural gas and crude oil revenue  and increased crude oil realized prices contributed million 
lower natural gas prices had a negative impact of million on natural gas and crude oil revenue during crude oil sales volumes increased from mbbls in to mbbls during the increase in crude oil production was primarily due to production from wells in wyoming and south texas that were brought onto production during natural gas sales volumes increased from bcf in to bcf in this increase was primarily due to production from a west texas well drilled and brought onto production in august this well produced bcf in as compared to bcf in the increase in production was partially offset by natural field declines and the sale of properties in live oak county  texas effective august  these properties produced mmcf in compared to mmcf in through the date of sale

average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  and o per mcf of natural gas 
lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense  or loe  increased from million in to million in the increase in loe was primarily due to a general increase in the cost of field services 
lower production taxes  due to the lower realized price for natural gas  were offset by increased advalorem taxes related to new wells

 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
in december  we elected early adoption of sfas r 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method or a modified retrospective method 
we elected to use the modified retrospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
the modified retrospective method  also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas  accordingly we have restated prior year financial statements to reflect this method 
as a result of the retrospective adoption of sfas r  the expenses previously recognized under the rules of variable accounting were reversed and a compensation expense measured according to sfas r was recorded 
as a result  we recognized stock based compensation of  during as a result of the adoption of this accounting change compared to  in  as restated 
the increase in stock based compensation in as compared to was due to new options granted during the latter part of and the first half of and the increase in the calculated fair value of these grants due to higher option prices as a result of the increase in the price of our common stock over previous option grants 
also contributing to the increase was director options grants that vest upon issuance resulting in all of the fair value of the options being recognized as stock based compensation in the current period 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon research done by us on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  we have determined that we will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  expense increased from million in to million in the increase in dd a was primarily due to increased production volumes in as well as a general increase in drilling and development cost in as compared to the increase in development cost was a result of an increase in estimated future development cost which causes an increase in the depletion base on which depletion is calculated 
our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase in the per mcfe basis was due to the increased depletion base as a result of higher estimated future development cost in as compared to which was partially offset by higher production volumes in interest expense 
interest expense increased from million to million for compared to the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest rates during income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in there was no income from discontinued operations in on february   grey wolf exploration inc completed an ipo resulting in abraxas substantially divesting itself of its investment in grey wolf 
the operations of grey wolf  previously reported as a business segment  are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and the operating results are reflected separately from the results of continuing operations 
income from discontinued operations for the period ended december  included a gain on the disposal of grey wolf of million  net of non cash income tax of million  and a loss from operations  including debt retirement costs  of million 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from natural gas and crude oil sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased commodity prices realized in as compared to  as well as an increase in natural gas production volumes 
higher commodity prices contributed million to natural gas and crude oil revenue while increased production volumes contributed million to revenue 
prior to  we were being paid on certain wells for the natural gas liquid content of the gas as a separate component as well as the value of the residue gas after processing 
in we elected to be paid for this natural gas at the wellhead 
accordingly  we did not recognize any natural gas liquids revenue in crude oil sales volumes decreased slightly from mbbls in to mbbls during the decrease was primarily due to natural field declines 
natural gas sales volumes increased from bcf in to bcf in this increase was primarily due to new production during offset by natural field declines 
new production brought on line at various times during contributed bcf to natural gas production and was partially offset by natural field decline 
average sales prices in net of hedging costs were o per bbl of crude oil  and o per mcf of natural gas

interest expense decreased from million to million for compared to the decrease in interest expense was due to decreased debt levels during while the outstanding debt at december  was slightly higher than the balance as december   the level of debt during the course of  prior to the financial restructuring that occurred in october  was significantly higher 
in addition  during most of  interest on our then outstanding secured notes was payable by the issuance of additional notes  which caused our cash interest expense in to be million 
with the issuance of the notes in october  interest became payable in cash  which led to all of the interest paid in being paid in cash 
financing costs 
financing costs in were million compared to zero in financing costs represent costs related to refinancing activities  which do not qualify for amortization over the life of the debt

income from discontinued operations for the year ended december  represents the operating results of grey wolf for the year then ended 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the natural gas and crude oil industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs o the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  o acquisition of interests in additional natural gas and crude oil properties  and o production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
our sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under our revolving credit facility  and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
we may also seek equity capital although we may not be able to complete any equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  under the terms of the notes  proceeds of optional sales of our assets that are not timely reinvested in new natural gas and crude oil assets will be required to be used to reduce indebtedness and proceeds of mandatory sales must be used to repay or redeem indebtedness 
working capital deficit 
at december  our current liabilities of approximately million exceeded our current assets of million resulting in a working capital deficit of million 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million as of december  current liabilities as of december  consisted of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties million  accrued interest of million and other accrued liabilities of million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures related to our continuing operations in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for the three years ended december  caption year ended december dollars in thousands 
del expenditure category exploration development    facilities and other total    del 
during  and  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties 
we anticipate making capital expenditures for ranging from to million which will be used primarily for the development of our current properties 
these anticipated expenditures are subject to adequate cash flow from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility 
if these sources of funding do not prove to be sufficient  we may also issue additional shares of equity securities although we may not be able to complete equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to make all of our budgeted capital expenditures will also be subject to availability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and services 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise  but we currently have no agreements  arrangements or undertakings regarding any material acquisitions 
we have no material long term capital commitments and are consequently able to adjust the level of our expenditures as circumstances dictate 
additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of natural gas and crude oil continue to decline and if our costs of operations continue to increase as a result of the scarcity of drilling rigs or if our production volumes decrease  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset natural gas and crude oil production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties  if any 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities  related to continuing operations  are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below caption year ended december  dollars in thousands 
del net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in provided by financing activities    total  del 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
expenditures in of approximately were primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties of million 
financing activities used million during  of which million was provided from long term borrowing offset by million of payments on long term debt 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
expenditures in of approximately were primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties 
financing activities provided million during  of which million was provided by a private placement of common stock  million was provided from long term borrowing offset by million of payments on long term debt 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
investing activities used million during primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties 
financing activities used million during  primarily for payments on long term debt and deferred financing fees future capital resources 
we currently have three principal sources of liquidity going forward i cash from operating activities  ii funding under our revolving credit facility  and iii if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  the sale of producing properties 
if these sources of liquidity do not prove to be sufficient  we may also issue additional shares of equity securities although we may not be able to complete equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
covenants under the indenture for the notes and the revolving credit facility restrict our use of cash from operating activities  cash on hand and any proceeds from asset sales 
under the terms of the notes  proceeds of optional sales of our assets that are not timely reinvested in new natural gas and crude oil assets will be required to be used to reduce indebtedness and proceeds of mandatory sales must be used to redeem indebtedness 
the terms of the notes and the revolving credit facility also substantially restrict our ability to o incur additional indebtedness  o grant liens  o pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments  o merge or consolidate with any other entity  or o sell  assign  transfer  lease  convey or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets 
our cash flow from operations depends heavily on the prevailing prices of natural gas and crude oil and our production volumes of natural gas and crude oil 
although we have hedged a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production and will continue this practice as required pursuant to the revolving credit facility  future natural gas and crude oil price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
falling natural gas and crude oil prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us or at all 
our cash flow from operations will also depend upon the volume of natural gas and crude oil that we produce 
unless we otherwise expand reserves  our production volumes may decline as reserves are produced 
due to sales of properties in and  the divestiture of grey wolf during the first quarter of  property sales in and restrictions on capital expenditures under the terms of our secured notes due which were refinanced in october  we now have significantly reduced reserves and production as compared with pre levels 
in the future  if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  we may sell additional properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful  exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes  however  our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or crude oil reservoirs will be found 

while we have had some success in pursuing these activities  we have not been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and property sales 
for example  during  we added approximately bcfe of proved reserves which were offset by bcfe of reserves attributable to properties we sold and bcfe of production 
if our proved reserves continue to decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently our cash flow from operations and the amount that we are able to borrow under our revolving credit facility will also decline 
the risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that of our total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
during  we expended approximately million for wells in south texas  west texas and wyoming 
these activities did not result in significant new production or reserves 
in west texas we are currently completing two wells in the bell and cherry canyon sands 
in the oates sw field of pecos county  texas  we have a well that is currently awaiting a drilling rig to drill the horizontal lateral in the devonian formation 
we continue to perform general well maintenance and work overs utilizing our own work over rigs 
in addition  approximately of our production for the year ended december  was from a single well in west texas 
if production from this well decreases  the volume of our production would also decrease which  in turn  would likely cause our cash flow from operations to decrease 
contractual obligations 
we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements o long term debt o operating leases for office facilities we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  caption payments due in contractual obligations dollars in thousands total thereafter

other obligations 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and other sources

in addition  any other subsidiary or affiliate of ours  that in the future guarantees any of our other indebtedness or of our restricted subsidiaries will be required to guarantee our obligations under the revolving credit facility 
obligations under the revolving credit facility are secured  together with the notes  by a shared first priority perfected security interest  subject to certain permitted encumbrances  in all of our and each of our restricted subsidiaries material property and assets  including substantially all of our and their natural gas and crude oil properties and all of the capital stock or in the case of an unrestricted subsidiary that is a controlled foreign corporation  up to of the outstanding capital stock in any entity  owned by us and our restricted subsidiaries 
under the revolving credit facility  we are subject to customary covenants  including certain financial covenants and reporting requirements 
the revolving credit facility requires us to maintain a minimum net cash interest coverage ratio and also requires us to enter into hedging agreements on not less than or more than of our projected natural gas and crude oil production 
in addition to the foregoing and other customary covenants  the revolving credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  restrict abraxas ability to o incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and issue certain types of preferred stock or redeemable stock  o transfer or sell assets  o create liens on assets  o pay dividends or make other distributions on capital stock or make other restricted payments  including repurchasing  redeeming or retiring capital stock or subordinated debt or making certain investments or acquisitions  o engage in transactions with affiliates  o guarantee other indebtedness  o make any change in the principal nature of our business  o prepay  redeem  purchase or otherwise acquire any of our or our restricted subsidiaries indebtedness  o permit a change of control  o directly or indirectly make or acquire any investment  o cause a restricted subsidiary to issue or sell our capital stock  and o consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of abraxas and our restricted subsidiaries

intercreditor agreement 
the holders of the notes  together with the lenders under our credit facility  are subject to an intercreditor  security and collateral agency agreement  which specifies the rights of the parties thereto to the proceeds from the collateral 
the intercreditor agreement  among other things  i creates security interests in the collateral in favor of a collateral agent for the benefit of the holders of the notes and the credit facility lenders and ii governs the priority of payments among such parties upon notice of an event of default under the indenture or the credit facility 
so long as no such event of default exists  the collateral agent will not collect payments under the new credit facility documents or the indenture governing the notes and other note documents collectively  the secured documents  and all payments will be made directly to the respective creditor under the applicable secured document 
upon notice of an event of default and for so long as an event of default exists  payments to each credit facility lender and holder of the notes from us and our current subsidiaries and proceeds from any disposition of any collateral  will  subject to limited exceptions  be collected by the collateral agent for deposit into a collateral account and then distributed as provided in the following paragraph 
upon notice of any such event of default and so long as an event of default exists  funds in the collateral account will be distributed by the collateral agent generally in the following order of priority first  to reimburse the collateral agent for expenses incurred in protecting and realizing upon the value of the collateral  second  to reimburse the credit facility administrative agent and the trustee  on a pro rata basis  for expenses incurred in protecting and realizing upon the value of the collateral while any of these parties was acting on behalf of the control party as defined below  third  to reimburse the credit facility administrative agent and the trustee  on a pro rata basis  for expenses incurred in protecting and realizing upon the value of the collateral while any of these parties was not acting on behalf of the control party  fourth  to pay all accrued and unpaid interest and then any unpaid commitment fees under the credit facility  fifth  if  the collateral coverage value of three times the outstanding obligations under the credit facility would be met after giving effect to any payment under this clause fifth  to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes  sixth  to pay all outstanding principal of and then any other unpaid amounts  including  without limitation  any fees  expenses  premiums and reimbursement obligations the credit facility  seventh  to pay all accrued and unpaid interest on the notes if not paid under clause fifth  eighth  to pay all outstanding principal of and then any other unpaid amounts  including  without limitation  any premium with respect to the notes  and ninth  to pay each credit facility lender  holder of the notes  and other secured party  on a pro rata basis  all other amounts outstanding under the credit facility and the notes

hedging activities our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
under our revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedge positions on not less than or more than of our projected oil and gas production for a six month rolling period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging sensitivity for further information 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had  subject to the limitation discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire through if not utilized 
uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance of million for deferred tax assets at december  and related party transactions abraxas has adopted a policy that transactions between abraxas and its officers  directors  principal stockholders  or affiliates of any of them  will be on terms no less favorable to abraxas than can be obtained on an arm s length basis in transactions with third parties and must be approved by the vote of at least a majority of the disinterested directors 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in natural gas and crude oil activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and crude oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and crude oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our natural gas and crude oil properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
we have experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in our natural gas and crude oil reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of natural gas and crude oil properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a pool by pool basis  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and the cost of properties not being amortized  less income taxes 
if net capitalized costs of natural gas and crude oil properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of natural gas and crude oil properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
estimates of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  o and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
hedge accounting 
from time to time  we use commodity price hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices 
results of those hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and crude oil sales 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for us on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in we elected out of hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas accordingly all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
changes in fair value of contracts are recognized in earnings in the current period 
due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of  and  respectively 
share based payments 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative under the new standard 
the company has elected early adoption of sfas r 
sfas r permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method  or a modified retrospective method 
the company has elected to use the modified retrospective method 
under the modified retrospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date  based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after that date  and based on the requirements of sfas for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
the modified retrospective method also permit entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on proforma disclosures made in accordance with sfas this standard requires the cost of all share based payments  including stock options  to be measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statement of operations 
in accordance with this standard  all periods prior to january  were restated to reflect the impact of the standard as if it had been adopted on january   the original effective date of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
also in accordance with the standard  the amounts that are reported in the statement of operations for the restated periods are the pro forma amounts previously disclosed under sfas no 
the company currently utilizes a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees 
while sfas r permits entities to continue to use such a model  the standard also permits the use of a more complex binomial  or lattice model 
based upon research done by the company on the alternative models available to value option grants  and in conjunction with the type and number of stock options expected to be issued in the future  the company has determined that it will continue to use the black scholes model for option valuation 
sfas r includes several modifications to the way that income taxes are recorded in the financial statements 
the expense for certain types of option grants is only deductible for tax purposes at the time that the taxable event takes place  which could cause variability in the company s effective tax rates recorded throughout the year 
sfas r does not allow companies to predict when these taxable events will take place 
furthermore  it requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature 
this requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after the effective date 
these future amounts cannot be estimated  because they depend on  among other things  when employees exercise stock options 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin requires an entity to evaluate its tax positions following a two step process 
the first step requires an entity to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step requires an entity to recognize in the financial statements each tax position that meets the more likely than not criterion 
each recognized tax position should be measured at the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of initially applying fin is required to be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of applying this guidance if any 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability 
additionally  it establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
we have not yet determined the impact that the implementation of sfas no 
will have on our results of operations or financial condition if any 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab requires companies to evaluate the materiality of identified unadjusted errors on each financial statement and related financial statement disclosure using both the rollover approach and the iron curtain approach  as those terms are defined in sab the rollover approach quantifies misstatements based on the amount of the error in the current year financial statement  whereas the iron curtain approach quantifies misstatements based on the effects of correcting the misstatement existing in the balance sheet at the end of the current year  irrespective of the misstatement s year s of origin 
financial statements would require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material 
correcting prior year financial statements for immaterial errors would not require previously filed reports to be amended 
if a company determines that an adjustment to prior year financial statements is required upon adoption of sab and does not elect to restate its previous financial statements  then it must recognize the cumulative effect of applying sab in fiscal beginning balances of the affected assets and liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to the fiscal opening balance in retained earnings 
sab is effective for interim periods of the first fiscal year ending after november  and was adopted by the company effective october  the adoption of sab did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent natural gas and crude oil producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for natural gas and crude oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in natural gas and crude oil  prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flow by approximately million for the year 
hedging sensitivity on january   we adopted sfas as amended by sfas and sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
in we elected not to designate derivative instruments as hedges 
accordingly the instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the market value of the derivatives being recorded in current oil and gas revenue 
under the terms of our revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedging positions with respect to not less than nor more than of our natural gas and crude oil production for a rolling six month period 
all hedge transactions are subject to our risk management policy  which has been approved by the board of directors 
we currently have the following hedges in place caption time period notional quantities price 
del april  mmbtu of production per day floor of may  mmbtu of production per day floor of june  mmbtu of production per day floor of july  mmbtu of production per day floor of august  mmbtu of production per day floor of september  mmbtu of production per day floor of del 
at december  the aggregate fair market value of our hedges was approximately  interest rate risk at december  we had million in outstanding indebtedness under the floating rate senior secured notes due the notes bear interest at a per annum rate of six month libor plus 
the rate is redetermined on june and december of each year  beginning june  the current rate on the notes is 
for every percentage point that the libor rate rises  our interest expense would increase by approximately million on an annual basis 
at december   we had million outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit facility 
interest on this facility accrues at the prime rate announced by wells fargo bank plus 
for every percentage point increase in the announced prime rate  our interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis
