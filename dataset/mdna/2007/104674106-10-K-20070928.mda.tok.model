 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
changes in existing regulatory tax laws and rates may affect the company s ability to manage successfully regulatory matters around the world  and future business results may affect the amount of deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
the company s accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can appropriately be reflected in the accounting estimates 
although the company s current estimates may be subject to change in the future  management does not believe such changes would result in a material period to period impact on the results of operations or the financial condition of the company 
goodwill and intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
in addition  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested annually for impairment 
changes in management s estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations

these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment
