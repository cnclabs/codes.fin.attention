item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed description and reconciliation of funds from operations and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to net income applicable to common shareholders 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  the overall economy and the travel industry  including lodging  continued to be strong 
we believe the lodging industry is in the midst of the fundamentally strong portion of a typical multi year up cycle  assuming a normal economic growth period 
with a strong balance sheet and high quality hotel portfolio  the company was able to take advantage of this environment  significantly increasing room revenue per available room revpar  funds from operations ffo  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the company s revenues come primarily from hotel operating revenues from its hotels 
hotel operating revenues include room  food and beverage and other ancillary revenue such as golf at two golf resorts  spa  telephone and parking revenue 
for  the company had net income applicable to common shareholders of million  or per diluted share 
ffo was million  or per diluted share unit and ebitda was million 
revpar was 
we consider revpar and ebitda to be key measures of the performance of the individual hotels 
revpar for the total portfolio increased for the revpar increase is primarily attributable to an average daily rate adr increase of to  while occupancy throughout the portfolio improved by to 
the company s ebitda increased due to the company s portion 
table of contents of the gain from selling the chicago marriott downtown  increased lodging demand  aggressive asset management and property acquisitions 
the company s hotel portfolio ebitda increased to million due to higher adr  occupancy and margin improvements 
the company measures hotel performance by evaluating financial metrics such as revpar  ffo and ebitda 
the company evaluates the hotels in its portfolio and potential acquisitions using the measures discussed above to determine each portfolio hotel s contribution or acquisition hotel s potential contribution toward reaching the company s goal of maintaining a reliable stream of income and moderate growth to shareholders 
the company invests in capital improvements throughout the portfolio to continue to increase the competitiveness of its hotels and improve their financial performance 
the company actively seeks to acquire new hotel properties that meet its investment criteria 
however  due to a high level of competitive capital resources  the company continues to face significant competition for acquisitions that meet its investment criteria 
please refer to non gaap financial measures below for a detailed discussion of the company s use of ffo and ebitda and a reconciliation of ffo and ebitda to net income  a us generally accepted accounting principles gaap measurement 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the operating partnership  lhl and the company s other consolidated subsidiaries and partnerships 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized the information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
for example  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated lease termination expense of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  related to the company s litigation with lehman brothers formerly meridien hotels  inc see item legal proceedings 
additionally  included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements is an estimated liability of million related to the company s litigation with lehman brothers see item legal proceedings  an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of million and an estimated deferred tax asset of million as of december  management believes that it is more likely than not that this deferred tax asset will be realized and has determined that no valuation allowance is required 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may determine these estimates differently  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses

investment in hotel properties upon acquisition  the company allocates the purchase price of asset classes based on the fair value of the acquired real estate  furniture  fixtures and equipment  assumed debt  and intangible assets 
the company s investments in hotel properties are carried at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings  years for building improvements  years for golf course land improvements  years for pool assets  and three to five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
renovations and or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives and classification of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company change the expected useful life or classification of particular assets  it would result in a change in depreciation expense and annual net income 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of each hotel to determine if circumstances exist indicating impairment to the carrying value of the investment in the hotel or that depreciation periods should be modified 
if facts or circumstances support the possibility of impairment  the company will prepare an estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  without interest charges  of the specific hotel and determine if the investment in such hotel is recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  an adjustment will be made to the carrying value of the hotel to reflect the hotel at fair value 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
the company does not believe that there are any facts or circumstances indicating impairment in the carrying value of any of its hotels

effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the modified prospective transition method 
among other items  sfas r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 

table of contents under the modified prospective method  compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date  and  based on the requirements of sfas  for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r 
the company has not issued any share option awards since the company recognizes compensation cost for restricted shares issued based upon the fair market value of the common shares at the grant date  adjusted for forfeitures 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most real estate industry investors consider ffo and ebitda to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 

table of contents the white paper on ffo approved by nareit in april defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by gaap as extraordinary  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred finance costs and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo consistent with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
with respect to ffo  the company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits  even though ffo does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
however  ffo may not be helpful when comparing the company to non reits 
with respect to ebitda  the company believes that excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization  and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  even though ebitda also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
neither ffo nor ebitda represents cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  cash flow from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
neither ffo nor ebitda is a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is ffo or ebitda indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
neither measurement reflects cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
to compensate for this  management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the company s operating performance

under the tax agreement  the company is required  among other things  to indemnify scg and its affiliates for certain income tax liabilities that such entities would incur if the westin copley place was transferred by the company in a taxable transaction or if the company fails to maintain a certain level of indebtedness with respect to the westin copley place or its operations 
the obligations of the company under the tax protection agreement i do not apply in the case of a foreclosure of the westin copley place  if certain specified requirements are met  ii are limited to million although a limitation of million is applicable to certain specified transactions  and iii terminates on the earlier of the th anniversary of the company s acquisition of the westin copley place or january  the company believes that the likelihood that the company will be required to pay under this tax agreement is remote  and therefore  a liability has not been recorded 

table of contents reserve funds certain of the company s agreements with its hotel managers  franchisors and lenders have provisions for the company to provide funds  generally to of hotel revenues  sufficient to cover the cost of a certain non routine repairs and maintenance to the hotels  and b replacements and renewals to the hotels furniture  fixtures and equipment 
certain agreements require that the company reserve cash 
as of december   million was available in restricted cash reserves for future capital expenditures 
the company has no other off balance sheet arrangements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of cash to meet its cash requirements  including distributions to shareholders  is its pro rata share of hotel operating cash flow distributed by lhl and the operating partnership s cash flow from the participating leases 
the company s senior unsecured credit facility contains certain financial covenants relating to debt service coverage  net worth and total funded indebtedness and contains financial covenants that  assuming no continuing defaults  allow the company to make shareholder distributions 
there are currently no other contractual or other arrangements limiting payment of distributions by the operating partnership 
similarly  lhl is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
payments to the operating partnership are required pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements between lhl and the operating partnership relating to the properties owned by the operating partnership and leased by lhl 
except for the security deposits required under the participating leases for the two hotels not leased by lhl  the lessees obligations under the participating leases are unsecured and the lessees abilities to make rent payments to the operating partnership  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  are dependent on the lessees abilities to generate sufficient cash flow from the operations of the hotels 
in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including competition from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lockouts that may impact operating performance  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares  and other expenses related to travel  which may deter traveling  terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings and military actions such as the war in iraq  and sars  pandemics or other medical events which may cause decreases in business and leisure travel  and adverse affects of weak general and local economic conditions 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues and therefore adversely affect the lessees of the company s hotels and their ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and therefore impact the company s liquidity

the company has given notice of its intent to redeem the series a preferred shares on march  sources and uses of cash at december   the company had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of restricted cash reserves 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to the distribution of available hotel operating cash by lhl and participating lease revenues  which were offset by payments for real estate taxes  personal property taxes  insurance and ground rent 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to the purchases of le parc suite hotel  house of blues hotel  westin michigan avenue  alexis hotel  hotel solamar and the graciela burbank  outflows for improvements and additions at the hotels  the funding of restricted cash reserves  offset by proceeds from restricted cash reserves

the company has considered its short term one year or less liquidity needs and the adequacy of its estimated cash flow from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs 
the company believes that its principal short term liquidity needs are to fund normal recurring expenses  debt service requirements  distributions on the preferred shares and the minimum distribution required to maintain the company s reit qualification under the code 
the company anticipates that these needs will be met with cash flows provided by operating activities and using availability under the senior unsecured credit facility 
the company also considers capital improvements and property acquisitions as short term needs that will be funded either with cash flows provided by operating activities  utilizing availability under the senior unsecured credit facility  the issuance of other indebtedness  or the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company expects to meet long term greater than one year liquidity requirements such as property acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  major renovations  expansions and other nonrecurring capital improvements utilizing availability under the senior unsecured credit facility  estimated cash flows from operations  the issuance of long term unsecured and secured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities

please refer to off balance sheet arrangements for a discussion of the reserve funds 

table of contents inflation the company s revenues come primarily from its pro rata share of the operating partnership s cash flow from the participating leases and the lhl hotel operating revenues  thus the company s revenues will vary based on changes in the underlying hotels revenues 
therefore  the company relies entirely on the performance of the hotels and the lessees abilities to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
the hotel operators can change room rates quickly  but competitive pressures may limit the lessees and hotel operators abilities to raise rates faster than inflation or even at the same rate 
the company s expenses primarily real estate taxes  property and casualty insurance  administrative expenses and lhl hotel operating expenses are subject to inflation 
these expenses are expected to grow with the general rate of inflation  except for energy costs  property and casualty insurance  liability insurance  property tax rates  employee benefits  and some wages  which are expected to increase at rates higher than inflation  and except for instances in which the properties are subject to periodic real estate tax reassessments 
derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
as of december   approximately of the company s borrowings were subject to variable rates 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposures  derivatives are used primarily to align rate movements between interest rates associated with the company s hotel operating revenue  participating lease revenue and other financial assets with interest rates on related debt  and manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company utilizes a variety of borrowings including lines of credit and medium and long term financings 
to reduce overall interest cost  the company uses interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is usually lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  the company uses a variety of methods and assumptions that are based on market conditions and risks existing as of each valuation date 
for the majority of financial instruments including most derivatives and long term debt  standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow analysis  option pricing models  replacement cost  and termination cost are used to determine fair value 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never actually be realized 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the table below provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including mortgage obligations  bonds and lines of credit 
for debt obligations  the table presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest variable rate debt weighted average interest total the table above presents the principal amount of debt maturing each year  including annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness incurred after that date 
the company s ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring the company s variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
as of december   approximately million of the company s aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate long term debt increase by  the increase in interest expense on the variable long term rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
on the other hand  if market rates of interest on the variable rate long term debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on the variable rate long term debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under the company s variable rate debt remains at million  the balance at december
