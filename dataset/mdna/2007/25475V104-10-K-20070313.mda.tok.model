item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
throughout this discussion and analysis  we discuss our two business segments for financial reporting purposes  northern and proton 
northern is our distributed generation systems business segment and proton is our hydrogen generator business segment 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on management s current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated and expressed in such forward looking statements and as a result of several factors  including the factors described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and other securities exchange act filings 
overview we provide products and services for distributed  or on site  power generation and storage 
using our systems  which produce energy at or near the place where it is used  our customers gain greater control over power quality  costs and management of their energy needs 
we design  integrate  construct and maintain power systems using a variety of technologies and energy sources both for grid connected customers and for customers who need power solutions for remote locations or require more reliable or environmentally benign alternatives to centrally distributed electricity 
we also market our hydrogen generators  which produce hydrogen from electricity and water in a clean and efficient process  to domestic and international customers for industrial  utility and research applications 
we are developing additional technologies and products for the distributed energy market  including systems that provide backup power and energy storage  hydrogen generators that produce hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles  power network architectures that link diverse power generating sources and advanced wind turbine generators 
our distributed generation systems produce electricity from conventional fuels and from cleaner  more sustainable sources such as wind  sunlight and biofuels  using reliable power generation technologies integrated with custom controls and power electronics 
we have installed over systems in more than countries during over years of operations 
our diverse customer base ranges from those who use our systems in remote applications  such as oil and gas pipelines and telecommunications facilities  to grid connected customers who use our systems for large commercial office buildings and manufacturing facilities 
our customers include petr leos mexicanos pemex  s 
c 
johnson son  inc  equity office properties trust  the timberland company and honeywell international inc our hydrogen generator systems utilize proprietary proton exchange membrane  or pem  electrochemical technology to produce hydrogen through the electrolysis of water 
our hydrogen generators have been designed to address the existing demand for industrial hydrogen in a safer and more cost effective manner than truck delivered hydrogen 
we have installed approximately hydrogen generators in more than countries over more than five years of operations 
our hydrogen generators are also being used in demonstration projects to supply fuel to fuel cell vehicles 
we are developing core pem technology to combine our hydrogen generator technology with a fuel cell power generator to create an energy device that is able to produce and store hydrogen fuel that it can later use to generate electricity  which we refer to as a regenerative fuel cell system 
in the longer term  we believe our regenerative fuel cell systems will enable renewable energy solutions by facilitating the storage of energy produced by non depleting  non polluting energy sources  such as solar  wind and hydroelectric power 
the company incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operating activities in each of the years in the three year period ended december  such circumstances raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as going concern 
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of the liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on  among other things  the company s ability to reduce its operating losses and operate profitably  to generate cash flow from operations  as well as the company s ability 
table of contents to maintain credit under its current debt agreements adequate to conduct its business 
if we became unable to continue as a going concern  we would have to liquidate our assets and we might receive significantly less than the value at which they are carried on our consolidated financial statements 
as further discussed in liquidity and capital resources management s plan  we have developed a plan to increase revenue  improve gross margin  reduce expense  potentially sell assets and raise additional capital in order to increase our cash balance 
critical accounting judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared by us in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  depreciable lives of equipment  warranty obligations and contingency accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a complete description of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our audit committee has discussed our critical accounting policies with management and our independent registered public accounting firm 
our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition product revenue all of our product revenue is derived from the operations of our proton segment 
for product sales for which adequate product warranty information exists  we record revenue when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred  sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if customer acceptance of products is not assured  revenue is recorded only upon formal customer acceptance 
customer acceptance provisions included in our product sales agreements may include written acceptance from the customer  acceptance upon servicing and installation of the equipment  and acceptance after a period of time 
revenue for product sales to distributors  for which there are no rights of return or price adjustments on unsold inventory  is recognized on a gross basis upon shipment to the distributors  as they assume title and risk of loss  subject to the deferral provisions below 
for all product sales where adequate product warranty information does not yet exist to reasonably estimate warranty costs  we defer revenue and costs until the expiration of the product warranty period 
during  we determined that we had adequate warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to our hogen h series hydrogen generators 
therefore  in the third quarter of we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of h series hydrogen generators upon shipment 
prior to the third quarter of  revenue on such h series units was recognized at the end of the warranty period  generally one year from the date of shipment 
during  we determined that we had adequate product warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to our hogen s series and our laboratory generators 
therefore  in the first quarter of  we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of laboratory generators with a two year warranty upon shipment  and in the third quarter of  we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of our hogen s series hydrogen generators upon shipment 
we also earn revenue from the rental of our hogen products 
we account for the agreements as operating leases under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for leases 
the agreements are cancelable at any time by either party without penalty 
rental revenue is recognized monthly over the term of the rental agreement 

table of contents revenue recognition contract revenue we principally generate commercial contract revenue from projects in our remote infrastructure  on site generation  and renewable energy field product lines at our northern power segment 
for projects with a duration of greater than three months where we have the ability to reasonably estimate total project costs to complete the contract  we recognize revenue utilizing the percentage of completion method as prescribed by sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  or sop  based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
where we do not have the ability to estimate costs or the contract contains restrictive provisions  such as title not transferring until the end of the contract  we use the completed contract method under sop the selection of methods under sop in some circumstances can be judgmental 
approximately  and of our contract revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively  was recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we also derive contract revenues from government sponsored research and development contracts and from commercial customers 
for government sponsored research and development contracts that are fixed price  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method under sop for fixed price incentive  or cost reimbursement contracts that do not require us to meet specific obligations  we record revenue as work is performed 
for those research and development contracts that require us to meet specified obligations  including delivery and acceptance obligations  we recognize amounts advanced as contract liabilities until such obligations are met 
once the obligations are met  we recognize the amounts as contract revenue 
for all other commercial contracts  we recognize revenue under the completed contract method 
the recognition of revenue from contracts accounted for under sop requires significant judgment to estimate the costs to complete contracts in progress  which has a significant impact on the amount and timing of recognition of revenue  cost of sales  gross margin and the recording of assets and liabilities 
contract costs may be incurred over a period of several months to several years and the long term nature and complexity of these contracts can affect our ability to estimate costs precisely 
for example  delays  changes in scope  increases in labor and material costs or other unforeseen events could result in actual costs to complete being different from our original estimates  and those differences could be material 
change orders that modify the scope of contracts are common in our business and often require significant judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty of negotiating with customers 
we base our estimates on historical experience  vendor quotes  and other projected costs we expect to incur over the term of the contract 
we review and update our cost estimates on a quarterly basis or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate 
if our estimates of the costs to complete a contract exceed anticipated revenue on a contract  we immediately recognize a loss at the time the loss becomes anticipated 
estimates of costs to complete that are too low would result in revenue being recognized too early and gross margins being too high at the onset of the contract 
our gross margin percentage for contract revenue may be affected by these changes in estimates and has fluctuated from to and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue recognition service revenue for service and repair contracts  we recognize revenue as work is performed 
for operating and maintenance contracts where we have agreed to provide routine maintenance services over a period of time for a fixed price  we recognize revenue ratably over the service period 
inventory we record inventory at the lower of cost or market value 
we determine cost by the average cost method 
this policy requires us to write down our inventory for the excess of the carrying value  which is typically the original cost  over the amount we expect to realize from the ultimate sale or other disposal of the inventory based upon on our assumptions regarding forecasted consumer demand  market conditions  inventory aging and 
table of contents technological obsolescence 
if any of our estimates are inaccurate  for example because of changes in technology that affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses or gains in excess of our established reserve  and those gains and losses could be material 
a change in our inventory reserve as of december  would have affected our pre tax loss by approximately  for the year ended december  goodwill and intangible assets we have adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these standards require the use of the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  set forth the accounting for the initial recognition of acquired intangible assets and goodwill  and describe the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill subsequent to initial recognition 
under the provisions of these standards  goodwill and certain intangible assets are deemed to have indefinite lives and are no longer subject to amortization 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis or more frequently in certain circumstances 
the performance of the test involves a two step process 
the first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair value of our reporting units with the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we generally determine the fair value of our reporting units using the expected present value of future cash flows  giving consideration to the market comparable approach 
if the carrying amount of our reporting units exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of our reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
we review goodwill and the northern power tradename for potential impairment annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or the northern power tradename might exceed their current fair value 
to assist in the process of reviewing goodwill and the northern power tradename for impairment  we obtain appraisals from an independent valuation firm 
the appraisal requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
we estimate the fair value of the northern reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model based on our most recent long range plan and compare the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
in the fourth quarter and throughout  northern s operating results were significantly less than expected due to revenue shortfalls and higher than anticipated costs 
additionally  northern s backlog also decreased since the third quarter of as work was performed on existing contracts  with no significant new contracts added to the backlog through december  in the fourth quarter we completed preparation of our operating plan and our related long term projections  which indicated lower than previously estimated revenue growth  gross margins and related operating cash flows 
these projections were used to estimate the fair value of the northern power reporting unit and it was determined that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value  which indicated goodwill impairment 
we then compared the implied fair value of the northern goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill and recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
the impairment review process involved significant judgment regarding northern s projected future cash flows and expected market conditions  and their impact on the selection of the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of northern 

table of contents intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of any impairment loss for intangible assets subject to amortization is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in the fourth quarter  we began an initiative to combine the operations of northern and proton to reduce costs and strengthen its systems sales  engineering  production  service and technology development 
in conjunction with that effort we determined that we would eliminate both the proton and northern brands  and operate in the marketplace under a single unified brand  distributed energy 
we will cease use of the northern tradename by april therefore  at december   we determined that the northern tradename had been impaired and recorded an impairment charge of  the fair value of the northern tradename was determined utilizing the income approach relief from royalty method 
we have assessed the useful lives of its other existing intangible assets  other than goodwill  and believes that estimated useful lives remain appropriate 
long lived assets we evaluate potential impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes procedures for the review of recoverability and measurement of impairment  if necessary  of long lived assets held and used by an entity 
sfas no 
requires that those assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we would be required to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of long lived assets is not recoverable based on their undiscounted cash flows 
the measurement of impairment loss is then based on the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional impairment losses that could be material to our results of operations 
northern power s results in the fourth quarter and for the year ended december  were significantly less than expected due to lower revenue and higher than anticipated costs 
additionally our annual goodwill impairment test resulted in the impairment and write off of all the goodwill relating to the northern power reporting unit 
these factors indicated that the carrying value amount of northern power s long lived assets may not be recoverable 
during the quarter ended december  we conducted an impairment review of its long lived assets  including its fixed assets and intangible assets  and concluded there was no impairment on the basis that the carrying amount of its long lived assets will be recoverable from the asset grouping s expected undiscounted cash flows 
warranty costs our warranty to customers is limited to replacement parts and services and generally expires one year from the date of shipment or contract completion  except with respect to laboratory hydrogen generators  where the warranty period is two years 
we record estimated warranty obligations in the period in which we recognize the related revenue or when a project is installed or commissioned 
we quantify and record an estimate for warranty related costs  this estimate is principally based on historical experience 
the accounting for warranties requires us to make assumptions and apply judgments when estimating product failure rates and expected material and labor costs 
we make adjustments to accruals as warranty claim data and historical experience warrant 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments used to calculate our warranty liability  because either failure rates or repair costs differ from our assumptions  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
a change in the warranty reserve at december  would have affected our pre tax loss by approximately  for the year ended december  
table of contents stock based compensation stock based compensation employee stock based awards on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases under the espp based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under apb  accounting for stock issued to employees for periods beginning in fiscal year in march  the sec issued sab providing supplemental implementation guidance for sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of operations 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method which requires the application of the accounting standard starting from january  our consolidated financial statements  as of and for the year ended december   reflect the impact of adopting sfas r 
non cash stock compensation expense for the year ended december   was  which consisted primarily of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options recognized under sfas r 
in addition  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  of  was recognized related to our espp 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense for employee stock options had been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations  because the exercise price of our stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method we used in adopting sfas r  our results of operations prior to have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the possible impact of sfas r 
additionally  under the modified prospective transition method  we were permitted to calculate a cumulative memo balance of windfall tax benefits from post years for purposes of accounting for future tax shortfalls 
we elected to apply the long form method for determining the pool of windfall tax benefits and have a pool of windfall tax benefits totaling approximately  at december  stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of stock based awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the year ended december   included compensation expense for stock based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas  and compensation expense for the stock based awards granted subsequent to december   based on the fair value on the grant date estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
compensation expense for all stock based awards granted will be recognized using the ratable single option method 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in our results for the first quarter of is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred for the purposes of pro forma information under sfas  as disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements for the related periods 
upon adoption of sfas r  we selected the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock based awards 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions which determine the fair value of stock based awards  including the option s expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
we have determined that historical volatility is most reflective of the market conditions and the best indicator of expected volatility 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
there is risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff bulletin no 
 or sab  using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses are significant to our financial statements  but these expenses are based on the option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
for this reason  and because we do not view share based compensation as related to our operational performance  we exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating the business performance of our operating segments 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
the following table highlights the impact that each of the various assumptions has on determining the fair value of an option or award when using an option pricing model impact of inputs to value of equity instrument volatility of stock higher the volatility higher the value expected term longer the term higher the value risk free rate higher the rate higher the value dividend yield lower the yield higher the value exercise price lower the exercise price a higher the value stock price fair value higher the stock price higher the value a presumes exercise is less than fair value 
table of contents stock based compensation non employee stock options we account for stock based compensation issued to non employees in accordance with sfas r and the consensus in emerging issues task force these pronouncements require the fair value of equity instruments given as consideration for services rendered to be recognized as a non cash charge to income over the shorter of the vesting or service period 
the equity instruments must be revalued on each subsequent reporting date until performance is complete with a cumulative catch up adjustment recognized for any changes in their fair value 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements on stock based compensation 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  with earlier adoption encouraged 
this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
after evaluating our tax position  we do not believe the adoption of fin will be material to our results of operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and for interim periods within those years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the related disclosure requirements 
the company does not expect that the adoption of fas will have a material impact on the financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for the first annual period ending after november  we have adopted the new bulletin and have determined that it does not have significant impact on our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years and revenues year ended net revenues december  december  increase decrease contract product service total 
table of contents the following chart provides comparative contract revenues by operating segment year ended contract revenue december  december  increase decrease northern proton total northern s on site revenue decreased approximately million in compared to due to the timing and size of the contracts for which revenue was recognized in each period 
northern s industrial infrastructure revenue decreased approximately million in from due to several projects in the full construction stage in compared to several projects being completed in without a comparable amount of new projects being started 
revenue associated with wind contracts decreased by approximately million due to a decrease in the number of contracts  offset by an increase in power distributor contracts of million as northern entered this market in northern s government contract revenue decreased approximately million due to fewer active projects in compared to the increase in proton s contract revenue is due to the recognition of approximately million related to its hydrogen fueling contract with shell hydrogen as well as an increase of approximately million over the prior year related to the increased number of active government sponsored contracts 
these increases were partially offset by the completion of contracts with the defense advanced research projects agency  e vermont fueling  and department of energy that totaled million 
the following chart provides comparative product revenues within the proton segment year ended product revenue december  december  increase decrease hydrogen generators rental and other total hogen h series revenue increased from million in to million in in the third quarter of  we determined we had adequate warranty history on hogen h series generators to recognize revenue and establish an accurate warranty provision upon shipment 
therefore  the revenue recognized in includes million of revenue recognized upon product warranty expiration related to units shipped in  and million of revenue related to units shipped in all of the revenue recognized in related to revenue recognized upon expiration of the product warranty period 
hogen s series revenue decreased from million in to million in for the twelve months ended december   we recognized million of revenue associated with our hogen s series generators upon shipment 
in the third quarter of  we determined we had adequate warranty history on hogen s series generators to recognize revenue and establish an accurate warranty provision upon shipment 
therefore  the revenue recognized in includes million of revenue recognized upon product warranty expiration related to units shipped in  and million of revenue related to units shipped in our laboratory generator revenue decreased from million in to million in for the twelve months ended december   we recognized million of revenue associated with our laboratory generator upon shipment 
in the first quarter of  we determined we had adequate warranty history and began recognizing revenue on our laboratory generators sold with a two year warranty 
the revenue recognized in 
table of contents includes previously deferred revenue of million recognized upon expiration of the warranty and million related to units shipped in the decrease in rental and other revenue relates to fewer rental units in the field 
some rental units were sold or returned in the following chart provides comparative services revenues by operating segment year ended service revenue december  december  increase decrease northern proton total northern s long term domestic operating and maintenance service revenue increased approximately million due its entry into this market in the third quarter of as well as from revenues recognized on contracts acquired from crown in this increase was offset by a million decrease in northern s international field service revenue due to the completion of commissioning on two pipelines 
the increase in service revenue associated with the proton segment relates to an increase in the number of units in the field resulting in additional spare part sales 
costs of revenue year ended cost of revenues december  december  increase decrease contract product service total the following chart provides comparative cost of contract revenues by operating segment year ended cost of revenues contract december  december  increase decrease northern proton total the decrease in northern s cost of contract revenue was due to the previously noted decrease in contract revenue 
cost of contract revenues as a percentage of contract revenues increased from in to in the decreased contract margins primarily relate to an increase in unabsorbed overhead costs 
the increase in unabsorbed overhead costs is a result of less contract activity at northern in as compared with and increased hiring in anticipation of increased contract volume 
the increase in proton s cost of contract revenue was due to the previously noted increase in contract revenue recognized for the year ended december  proton s cost of contract revenue as a percentage of 
table of contents contract revenue increased from approximately in to approximately in this decrease in gross margin relates to cost overruns on certain contracts that completed during the year and a higher proportion of lower margin contracts in the following chart provides comparative cost of product revenues within the proton segment year ended cost of revenues product december  december  increase decrease hydrogen generators rental and other total hogen h series cost of revenue increased from million in to million in in the third quarter of  we determined we had adequate warranty history on hogen h series generators to recognize revenue and establish an accurate warranty provision upon shipment 
therefore  the cost of product revenues recognized in includes million of cost of revenue recognized upon product warranty expiration related to units shipped in  million of cost of revenue related to units shipped in and million related to warranty and other costs of production 
all of the cost recognized in related to costs associated with units whose warranty period had expired 
our gross margins related to this product line increased from to in primarily due to fewer lower of cost or market adjustments  increased selling prices and favorable warranty experience 
hogen s series cost of revenue decreased from million in to million in all of the cost recognized in related to costs associated with units which had shipped and for which revenue was recognized during in the third quarter  we determined we had adequate warranty history on hogen s series generators to recognize revenue and establish an accurate warranty provision upon shipment 
therefore  the cost of product revenues recognized in includes million of cost recognized upon product warranty expiration related to units shipped in and million of cost related to units shipped in our gross margin related to this product line increased from in to in primarily due to increased selling prices and favorable warranty experience 
our laboratory generator cost of revenue decreased from million in to million in all of the cost recognized in related to costs associated with units which had shipped and for which revenue was recognized during in the first quarter of  we determined we had adequate warranty history and began recognizing revenue on our laboratory generators sold with two year warranties 
the cost of revenue recognized in includes previously deferred cost of million and million of cost related to units shipped in our gross margin associated with this product was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following chart provides comparative cost of service revenues by operating segment year ended cost of revenues service december  december  increase decrease northern proton total the increase in northern s cost of service revenue was due to the previously noted increase in active and or completed contracts 
service cost of revenue as a percentage of service revenue increased from in to in this increase in cost of service revenue was primarily attributable to a change in northern s mix 
table of contents of service contracts 
service revenues were primarily from one time higher margin international field service time and material contracts in in  revenue was derived primarily from longer term  multi year domestic operating and maintenance contracts  which tend to have lower margins 
additionally  costs include additional overhead costs associated with our growing service business 
we do not believe the negative gross margins in are indicative of loss contracts 
the increase in proton s service cost revenues relates to the increased number of hydrogen generator units in the field 
hydrogen generator units shipped the following tables present hydrogen generator unit shipment details and the revenue and costs deferred on those unit shipments for the years ended december  and hydrogen generator unit shipments december  december  increase decrease s series h series laboratory generators total revenue deferred on units shipped december  december  increase decrease s series h series laboratory generators total cost deferred on units shipped december  december  increase decrease s series h series laboratory generators total during the third quarter of  we determined that we had adequate product warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to our hogen h series products 
during  we determined that we had adequate product warranty information and experience to begin recognizing product revenue related to our hogen s series and our laboratory generators 
therefore  in the first quarter of  we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of laboratory generators with a two year warranty upon shipment  and in the third quarter of we began recognizing product revenue related to sales of our hogen s series hydrogen generators upon shipment 

table of contents research and development expenses the following chart reflects the amounts and percentage change of significant research and development costs year ended research and development december  december  increase decrease employee related project material depreciation and amortization stock based compensation other total employee related costs and project material decreased primarily due to less development effort associated with proton s hydrogen generators  offset by increased project costs at northern related to development of its power distributor products 
depreciation and amortization decreased as certain capitalized equipment reached its estimated useful life at the end of stock based compensation increased due to the adoption of fas r in january the increase in other costs was primarily due to a decrease in ccef program milestone related credits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses the following chart reflects the amounts and percentage change of significant selling  general and administrative costs year ended selling  general and administrative december  december  increase decrease employee related marketing and advertising depreciation  amortization stock based compensation legal  consulting and accounting other total the increased employee related costs were primarily due to an increase in the number of employees particularly at northern  an increase in travel related costs  as well as costs associated with the addition of our new chief executive officer in january the increase in marketing and advertising was generally due to increased new market development costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization was primarily due to increased capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of  related to our barre  vermont facility and intangible assets associated with the crown acquisition in the second quarter of stock based compensation increased due to the recognition of expense related to the adoption of fas r in january the increase in legal  consulting and accounting expenses was primarily related to increased audit related fees

the loan agreement contains a material adverse change clause allowing webster  at its option  to declare the loan immediately payable if they believe there has been a material adverse change in our financial condition  however  we consider it remote that webster will declare the loan immediately payable due to the restricted cash balance that equals the amount of the loan

northern owns of the nps condo association and has the ability to exercise significant influence over the nps condo association 
we transferred certain property and development rights under nps condo association to the central vermont economic development corporation  or cvedc 
in consideration  cvedc secured a  loan from the vermont economic development authority  or veda  to complete the facility and lease back the facility to northern 
the terms of the lease include an initial term of ten years  lease payments equal to the debt payments plus an administrative fee  and a purchase option for northern equal to the outstanding loan amount

maturities under the capital lease obligation at december  are as follows  and thereafter  in october  northern completed the purchase of a  square foot manufacturing facility in barre  vermont 
this facility  a portion of which had been leased by northern since  added capacity for northern s power systems and product business 
under the purchase  northern qualified for assistance from veda  which together with vermont s merchants bank provided financing for a substantial portion of the facility  land  and future facility improvements 
veda made available a total of  at a variable rate equal to two percentage points less than veda s prevailing rate for taxable financing with a maturity date of october   which was per annum at december  the veda debt currently requires monthly payments of  and a final balloon payment in october  as of december   northern has drawn down a total of  on this loan

we have incurred recurring operating losses and cash outflows 
as a result of these conditions  there is more than a remote chance that merchants bank may declare the loans immediately payable 
accordingly  we have classified the entire balance as a current liability 
the loan is collateralized by the barre  vermont property 
scheduled maturities under the obligation as of december  are as follows      and thereafter  in july  northern purchased a phone system for its waitsfield  vermont and barre  vermont facilities and obtained a  loan with merchants bank

maturities under the obligation as of december  are as follows  in august  we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of our office space in our wallingford  connecticut location to an unrelated party

table of contents in september  we entered into an agreement to lease approximately  square feet of commercial space at our waitsfield  vermont location to an unrelated party 
the lease has a five year term  with rent payment escalations each year of the agreement

the rental income under the terms of the lease is approximately management s plan the company incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operating activities in each of the years in the three year period ended december  such circumstances raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as going concern 
the realization of assets and the satisfaction of the liabilities in the normal course of business are dependent on  among other things  the company s ability to reduce its operating losses and operate profitably  to generate cash flow from operations  as well as the company s ability to maintain credit under its current debt agreements adequate to conduct its business 
if we became unable to continue as a going concern  we would have to liquidate our assets and we might receive significantly less than the value at which they are carried on our consolidated financial statements 
we have developed a plan to increase revenue  improve gross margin  reduce expense  potentially sell assets and raise additional capital in order to increase our cash balance 
in the fourth quarter we did not sign as many epc contracts as we had planned  our revenue at both northern and proton was lower than expected  and our contract gross margins on existing contracts was lower than planned 
as a result we incurred a larger operating loss and used more cash than planned 
as a result our cash and marketable securities on hand as of december   together with our forecasted revenues and existing backlog may not be sufficient to fund operations through december  management may need to take additional actions to further reduce operating expenses 
if additional funding is required  sufficient funds may not be available to us thereafter or on terms that we deem acceptable  if they are available at all 
management has developed a plan to increase revenue  improve gross margin  reduce expenses  potentially sell assets and raise additional capital in order to increase our cash balance 
this plan includes we announced a person approximately reduction of our workforce on january  we will take additional workforce reduction actions in the future if business conditions warrant 
we announced our plan to exit our waitsfield  vermont facility and combine our vermont operations into our barre  vermont facility 
we have engaged a commercial real estate broker to identify parties that would be interested in purchasing our connecticut facility and leasing it back to us 
such a transaction  if completed  would generate cash but not disrupt any of our manufacturing or assembly operations 
we have redesigned our sales opportunity management and contract negotiation process and with such changes expect to be more selective about the contracts we enter into 
we expect this will result in improved margins on our contracts 
as previously announced  we have introduced our new stableflow product and expect that this product will generate additional revenue and cash flow during we may seek to raise additional capital in the public markets 

table of contents we believe our plan is sufficient to provide us enough cash to meet all of our obligations as they come due throughout  however  a number of factors pose risk and uncertainty in the execution of our plan  including our ability to enter into new contracts and receive sales orders that will generate contract  product and service revenues 
our ability to achieve gross margins sufficient to cover our operating expenses and generate positive cash flow our ability to control operating expenses our ability to complete a sale leaseback transaction of our wallingford facility 
the potential acceleration of debt service payments by one of our lenders as the result of subjective acceleration clauses in our debt agreements our ability to secure additional equity capital funding or debt funding on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our ability to obtain additional funding will be subject to a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor sentiment 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of additional funding unattractive 
if we issue additional equity securities  existing stockholders may experience dilution or be subordinated to any rights  preferences or privileges granted to the new equity holders 
our independent registered public accountants have modified their report for our fiscal year ended december  with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
this modification may negatively affect our capital raising efforts or our ability to sign new contracts with customers 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis of a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
if we became unable to continue as a going concern  we would have to liquidate our assets and we might receive significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities consisting of us government and agency securities that are held by one major banking institution 
distributed energy s marketable securities portfolio of approximately million includes one callable security with a fair market value totaling approximately million 
this security generates a higher relative rate of interest for distributed energy  in return  the embedded call option gives the issuer the right to buy back the security 
interest rate risk is the major price risk facing our investment portfolio 
such exposure can subject us to economic losses due to changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
generally  as interest rates rise  prices for fixed income instruments will fall 
as rates decline the inverse is true 
we attempt to mitigate this risk by investing in high quality issues of short duration 
we do not expect any material loss from our marketable securities investments and believe that our potential interest rate exposure is not material 
the following table provides information about the distributed energy s financial instruments  stated at the fair value as of december   that are sensitive to changes in interest rates investments fixed rate investments average interest rate additionally  we are exposed to market risk due to variable interest rates under our financing arrangements 
at december   we had million outstanding under our seven year webster bank term note that is subject to a variable interest rate 
the note bears interest at one month libor plus basis points  which was per annum at december  at december   we had million outstanding under our ten year term note that is subject to a variable interest rate 
the note bears interest at a variable rate equal to two percentage points less than veda s prevailing rate for taxable financing  which was per annum at december   with a maturity date of october  if our variable interest rate were to increase or decrease by  we do not believe such a change would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
