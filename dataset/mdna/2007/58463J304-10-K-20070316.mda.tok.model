item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were incorporated in maryland on august  primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net leased healthcare facilities across the united states 
we also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants 
we have operated as a real estate investment trust reit since april   and accordingly  elected reit status upon the filing in september of our calendar year federal income tax return 
our existing tenants are  and our prospective tenants will generally be  healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations 
we offer financing for these operators real estate through lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms typically for years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers 
we also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual rate increases that in the current market range from to 
our existing portfolio escalators range from to 
most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases 
in addition to the base rent  our leases require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility 
some leases also require our tenants to pay percentage rents which are based on the level of those tenants net revenues from their operations 
we selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our taxable reit subsidiary  which they use for acquisitions and working capital 
we consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons it provides opportunities to make income earning investments that yield attractive risk adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise  and by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators  we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of  and financing sources for  healthcare facilities 
for purpose of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  we conduct business operations in one segment 
at december   we owned operating healthcare facilities and held three mortgage loans secured by three other properties 
in addition  we are developing two additional healthcare facilities that are not yet in operation 
we had one acquisition loan outstanding  the proceeds of which our tenant used for the acquisition of six hospital operating companies 
the facilities we owned and the three facilities that secured our mortgage loans were in ten states  had a carrying cost of approximately million including the balances of our mortgage loans and comprised approximately of our total assets 
our acquisition and other loans of approximately million represented approximately of our total assets 
we do not expect such loan assets at any time to exceed of our total assets 
we also had cash and temporary investments of approximately million that represented less than one percent of our assets 
our revenues are derived from rents we earn pursuant to the lease agreements with our tenants and from interest income from loans to our tenants and other facility owners 
our tenants and borrowers operate in the healthcare industry  generally providing medical  surgical and rehabilitative care to patients 
the capacity of our tenants to pay our rents and interest is dependent upon their ability to conduct their operations at profitable levels 
we believe that the business environment of the industry segments in which our tenants operate is generally positive for efficient operators 
however  our tenants operations are subject to economic  regulatory and market conditions that may affect their profitability 
accordingly  we monitor certain key factors  changes to which we believe may provide early indications of conditions that may affect the level of risk in our lease and loan portfolio 
key factors that we consider in underwriting prospective tenants and in monitoring the performance of existing tenants include the following the historical and prospective operating margins measured by a tenant s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and facility rent of each tenant and at each facility  the ratio of our tenants operating earnings both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs  including debt costs  
table of contents trends in the source of our tenants revenue  including the relative mix of medicare  medicaid medical  managed care  commercial insurance  and private pay patients  and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on our tenants profitability 
certain business factors  in addition to those described above that directly affect our tenants  will likely materially influence our future results of operations 
these factors include trends in the cost and availability of capital  including market interest rates  that our prospective tenants may use for their real estate assets instead of financing their real estate assets through lease structures  unforeseen changes in healthcare regulations that may limit the opportunities for physicians to participate in the ownership of healthcare providers and healthcare real estate  reductions in reimbursements from medicare  state healthcare programs  and commercial insurance providers that may reduce our tenants profitability and our lease rates  and competition from other financing sources 
at march   we had employees 
over the next months  we expect to add four to six additional employees 
critical accounting policies in order to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances 
we believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of lease revenues  credit losses  fair values and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets  stock compensation expense  and the effects of any derivative and hedging activities will have significant effects on our financial statements 
each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments 
we intend to rely on our experience  collect historical and current market data  and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates 
under different conditions or assumptions  materially different amounts could be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
in addition  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could materially differ from these estimates 
our accounting estimates will include the following revenue recognition 
our revenues  which are comprised largely of rental income  include rents that each tenant pays in accordance with the terms of its respective lease reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of the lease 
since some of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset  and include in revenues  straight line rent that we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  to what extent the straight line rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review each tenant s straight line rent receivable on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history  the financial condition of the tenant  business conditions in the industry in which the tenant operates  and economic conditions in the area in which the facility is located 
in the event that the collectibility of straight line rent with respect to any given tenant is in doubt  we are required to record an increase in our allowance for uncollectible accounts or record a direct write off of the specific rent receivable  which would have an adverse effect on our net income for the year in which the reserve is increased or the direct write off is recorded and would decrease our total assets and stockholders equity 
at that time  we stop accruing additional straight line rent income 
our development projects normally allow us to earn what we term construction period rent 
we record the accrued construction period rent as a receivable and as deferred revenue during the construction period 
we recognize earned revenue on the straight line method as the construction period rent is paid to us by the lessee operator  usually beginning when the lessee operator takes physical possession of the facility 
we make loans to certain tenants and from time to time may make construction or mortgage loans to facility owners or other parties 
we recognize interest income on loans as earned based upon the principal amount 
table of contents outstanding 
these loans are generally secured by interests in real estate  receivables  the equity interests of a tenant  or corporate and individual guarantees 
as with straight line rent receivables  our management must also periodically evaluate loans to determine what amounts may not be collectible 
accordingly  a provision for losses on loans receivable is recorded when it becomes probable that the loan will not be collected in full 
the provision is an amount which reduces the loan to its estimated net receivable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from the collateral  if any 
at that time  we discontinue recording interest income on the loan to the tenant 
investments in real estate 
we record investments in real estate at cost  and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset 
while our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility  to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance  we expense those costs as incurred 
we compute depreciation using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of years for buildings and improvements  five to seven years for equipment and fixtures  and the shorter of the useful life or the remaining lease term for tenant improvements and leasehold interests 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our facilities for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate improvements 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because  if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate improvements  we would depreciate these investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that the operations related to facilities that have been sold  or that we intend to sell  be presented as discontinued operations in the statement of operations for all periods presented  and facilities and related assets we intend to sell be designated as held for sale on our balance sheet 
when circumstances such as adverse market conditions indicate a possible impairment of the value of a facility  we review the recoverability of the facility s carrying value 
the review of recoverability is based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows  excluding interest charges  from the facility s use and eventual disposition 
our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income  market and other applicable trends  and residual value  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the values of our investments in real estate 
purchase price allocation 
we record above market and below market in place lease values  if any  for the facilities we own which are based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
we amortize any resulting capitalized above market lease values as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
we amortize any resulting capitalized below market lease values as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination of long term lease arrangements at market rates  we do not expect the above market and below market in place lease values to be significant for many of our anticipated transactions 
we measure the aggregate value of other intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between i the property valued with existing leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
management s estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers eg  discounted cash flow analysis 
factors considered by management in its analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing  and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  which we expect to range 
table of contents primarily from three to months  depending on specific local market conditions 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal costs  and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets to be acquired  if any  is further allocated to in place lease values and customer relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that tenant 
characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality  and expectations of lease renewals  including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement  among other factors 
we amortize the value of in place leases to expense over the initial term of the respective leases  which are typically years 
the value of customer relationship intangibles is amortized to expense over the initial term and any renewal periods in the respective leases  but in no event will the amortization period for intangible assets exceed the remaining depreciable life of the building 
should a tenant terminate its lease  the unamortized portion of the in place lease value and customer relationship intangibles would be charged to expense 
accounting for derivative financial investments and hedging activities 
we expect to account for our derivative and hedging activities  if any  using sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
 which requires all derivative instruments to be carried at fair value on the balance sheet 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to variability in expected future cash flows  or other types of forecasted transactions  are considered cash flow hedges 
we expect to formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking each hedge transaction 
we plan to review periodically the effectiveness of each hedging transaction  which involves estimating future cash flows 
cash flow hedges  if any  will be accounted for by recording the fair value of the derivative instrument on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability  with a corresponding amount recorded in other comprehensive income within stockholders equity 
amounts will be reclassified from other comprehensive income to the income statement in the period or periods the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
derivative instruments designated in a hedge relationship to mitigate exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset  liability  or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk  which we expect to affect the company primarily in the form of interest rate risk or variability of interest rates  are considered fair value hedges under sfas no 
in  we entered into derivative contracts as part of our offering of exchangeable senior notes the exchangeable notes 
the contracts are generally termed capped call or call spread contracts 
these contracts are financial instruments which are separate from the exchangeable notes themselves  but affect the overall potential number of shares which will be issued by us to satisfy the conversion feature in the exchangeable notes 
the exchangeable notes can be exchanged into shares of our common stock when our stock price exceeds per share  which is the equivalent of shares per  note 
the number of shares actually issued upon conversion will be equivalent to the amount by which our stock price exceeds times the conversion rate 
the capped call transaction allows us to effectively increase that exchange price from to 
therefore  our shareholders will not experience dilution of their shares from any settlement or conversion of the exchangeable notes until the price of our stock exceeds per share rather than per share 
when evaluating this transaction  we have followed the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
eitf no 
requires that contracts such as this capped call which meet certain conditions must be accounted for as permanent adjustments to equity rather than periodically adjusted to their fair value as assets or liabilities 
we have evaluated the terms of these contracts and have determined that this capped call must be recorded as a permanent adjustment to stockholders equity 
we have therefore shown the premium paid in this transaction as a one time adjustment in the statement of stockholders equity 
the exchangeable notes themselves also contain the conversion feature described above 
sfas no 
also states that certain embedded derivative contracts must follow the guidance of eitf no 
and be evaluated as though they also were a freestanding derivative contract 
embedded derivative contracts such the conversion 
table of contents feature in the notes should not be treated as a financial instrument separate from the note if it meets certain conditions in eitf no 
we have evaluated the conversion feature in the exchangeable notes and have determined that it should not be reported separately from the debt 
variable interest entities 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in december  the fasb issued a revision to fin  which is termed fin r 
fin r clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and provides guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  guidance on how to determine which business enterprise should consolidate such an entity  and guidance on when it should do so 
this model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
an entity meeting either of these two criteria is a variable interest entity  or vie 
a vie must be consolidated by any entity which is the primary beneficiary of the vie 
if an entity is not the primary beneficiary of the vie  the vie is not consolidated 
we periodically evaluate the terms of our relationships with our tenants and borrowers to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary and would therefore be required to consolidate any tenants or borrowers that are vies 
our evaluations of our transactions indicate that we have loans receivable from two entities which we classify as vies 
however  because we are not the primary beneficiary of these vies  we do not consolidate these entities in our financial statements 
stock based compensation 
prior to  we used the intrinsic value method to account for the issuance of stock options under our equity incentive plan in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
r became effective for our annual and interim periods beginning january   but had no material effect on the results of our operations 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  of expense for share based compensation related to grants of restricted common stock and deferred stock units 
in  we also granted performance based restricted share awards 
because these awards will vest based on the company s performance  we must evaluate and estimate the probability of achieving those performance targets 
any changes in these estimates and probabilities must be recorded in the period when they are changed 
during  we awarded  shares of restricted stock which are based solely on performance criteria over the next five years 
disclosure of contractual obligations the following table summarizes known material contractual obligations associated with investing and financing activities as of december  less than after contractual obligations year years years years total construction contracts senior notes exchangeable notes revolving credit facility operating lease commitments totals excludes the term loan of million which was paid off on january  assumes the balance and interest rates are those in effect at december  and no principal payments are made until the expiration of the facility in some of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants 

table of contents the company also has outstanding letters of credit which total million at december  and which expire in liquidity and capital resources as of march   we have approximately million in cash and temporary liquid investments 
from the time of our initial capitalization in april through completion of our february  follow on offering  we have issued approximately million shares of common stock and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
we have also issued million in fixed rate term notes and million in fixed rate exchangeable notes 
at march   we have in place a million secured revolving credit facility with an available borrowing base of approximately million 
we have substantially used this equity and debt capital to acquire and develop healthcare real estate  fund mortgage loans and fund other loans to healthcare operators 
in addition  we believe our present capitalization provides sufficient liquidity and resources to continue executing our business plan for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had remaining commitments to complete the funding of two development projects as described below in millions original cost remaining commitment incurred commitment bucks county women s hospital and medical office building portland long term acute care hospital total we expect these two developments to begin operation in the second quarter of we have no new development projects under commitment at march   which will reduce our need for cash to fund projects which produce no revenue during construction and development 
short term liquidity requirements we believe that our existing cash and temporary investments  funds available under our existing loan agreements  additional financing arrangements and cash from operations will be sufficient for us to complete the developments described above  acquire in excess of million in additional assets  provide for working capital  and make distributions to our stockholders through we expect that such additional financing arrangements will include various types of new debt and proceeds from the sale of up to million shares of common stock pursuant to forward sale agreements between us and certain investment banking firms described below 
generally  we believe we will be able to finance up to approximately of the cost of our healthcare facilities  however  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain or maintain those levels of debt on our portfolio of real estate assets on favorable terms in the future 
long term liquidity requirements we believe that cash flow from operating activities subsequent to will be sufficient to provide adequate working capital and make distributions to our stockholders in compliance with our requirements as a reit 
however  in order to continue acquisition and development of healthcare facilities during and after at our goals of million annually  we will require access to more permanent external capital  possibly including preferred and common equity capital 
if equity capital is not available at a price that we consider appropriate  we may increase our debt  utilize other forms of capital  if available  or reduce our acquisition activity 
in february  we sold million shares of common stock and realized net proceeds of million 
concurrently  the underwriters borrowed from third parties and sold million shares of our common stock in connection with forward sale agreements between us and affiliates of the underwriters 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the forward purchasers 
we expect to settle the forward sale agreements and receive proceeds  subject to certain adjustments  from the sale of those shares upon one or more future physical settlements of the forward sale agreements on a date or dates specified by us by february  the forward sale arrangements allow us to take down the proceeds as needed over the next year at a pre determined price  but without immediately diluting our existing shares 

table of contents in addition  at march   we have immediate availability under our secured revolving credit arrangement of approximately million and we may access up to approximately million pursuant to our forward sale arrangement described below prior to february  we also expect to enter into another secured credit arrangement in the near future that we expect will provide approximately million in availability 
at march   we had unused proceeds of approximately million from our sale of shares of our common stock in february investing activities during the year ended december   we made investments in eight existing healthcare facilities with an aggregate investment value of million  and net cash outlays of million  after subtracting contingent payments and facility improvement reserves 
we invested an additional million in properties owned at december  we also invested million in our development projects 
in  we made loans with a total principal value of million  and net cash outlays of million  after subtracting contingent payments and facility improvement reserves 
our primary loans in were two first mortgage loans of million 
in september  vibra reduced the principal amount of its loans by million following the repurchase of one of its properties 
in january  vibra further reduced the principal amount of its loans by million 
our expectations about future investing activities are described above under liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations we began operations during the second quarter of since then  we have substantially increased our income earning investments each year  and we expect to continue to materially add to our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we expect that future results of operations will vary materially from our historical results 
the results of operations presented below for the year ended december   have been adjusted to reflect the operations of two facilities which are recorded as discontinued operations at december  year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net income for the year ended december  was  compared to net income of  for the year ended december  a comparison of revenues for the years ended december  and is as follows change base rents straight line rents percentage rents interest from loans fee income total revenue revenue for the year ended december   was comprised of rents and interest and fee income from loans

this payment allows vibra to reduce its annual percentage rent payments to us from of net revenues to of net revenues

the increase is due primarily to approximately million of non cash share based compensation expense from restricted shares and deferred stock units granted to employees  officers and directors during we expect non cash share based compensation to increase in because shares that were awarded in but do not vest until certain performance hurdles are met must nonetheless be expensed beginning in the year of the award based on our estimate of the likelihood of achieving those performance hurdles

the increase is due primarily to approximately million of share based compensation expense of the increase in general and administrative expenses as a result of restricted shares granted to employees  officers and directors during in addition  we incurred incremental legal and professional expenses in related to our reporting and other compliance requirements as a public company 
during we also incurred additional compensation expense related to the increased number of employees in interest income other than from loans for the years ended december  and  totaled  and  respectively

interest expense in excludes interest of approximately million which has been capitalized as part of the cost of development projects under construction during discontinued operations we entered into a contract for the disposition of two assets in on october   two of our subsidiaries terminated their respective leases with stealth  lp stealth 
the leases were for the hospital and medical office building mob  respectively  operated together by stealth as houston town and county hospital in houston  texas 
the leases were originally entered into in  with the lease for the hospital scheduled to expire in and that for the mob to expire in the leases required stealth to make monthly payments of rent  including annual escalations of rent  and payments to fund repairs and improvements 
the leases also required stealth to pay all operating expenses of the facilities  including ad valorem taxes  insurance and utilities 
in  we recorded revenue of approximately million from the leases and loans with stealth 
in connection with entering into the leases with stealth  we also made working capital loans to stealth in an aggregate amount  including accrued interest and after applying offsetting credits  of approximately million 
subsequent to the lease termination  we received the full proceeds of a letter of credit issued to us by stealth in the amount of million  which was used to reduce the amount outstanding under the loans 
stealth had not obtained managed care provider contracts that we believed were necessary for profitable operation of the hospital 
accordingly  and pursuant to our rights under the leases  we terminated the leases and began negotiations directly with other hospital systems to lease or sell the facilities 
these negotiations resulted in the ultimate sale of the hospital and mob in january   for a sales price of approximately million 
during the period from the lease termination to the date of sale  the hospital was operated by a new third party operator under contract to the hospital 
we also made loans to the operating company in amount of approximately million  which we expect to recover from the net revenues which the hospital and the mob generated during the interim period 
the revenues and expenses from our leases and loans to stealth for the houston town and country hospital are shown in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures investors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations  or ffo  as a supplemental performance measure 
while we believe net income available to common stockholders  as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  is the most appropriate measure  our management considers ffo an appropriate supplemental measure given its wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts 
ffo  reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions  principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  which assume that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  ffo represents net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses on sales of real estate  plus real estate 
table of contents related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we compute ffo in accordance with the nareit definition 
ffo should not be viewed as a substitute measure of the company s operating performance since it does not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties  which are significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations 
the following table presents a reconciliation of ffo to net income for the years ended december  and for the years ended december  net income depreciation and amortization funds from operations ffo per diluted share amounts for the years ended december  net income depreciation and amortization funds from operations ffo distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit commencing with our taxable year that began on april  and ended on december  to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to our stockholders 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain such status going forward

we intend to pay to our stockholders  within the time periods prescribed by the code  all or substantially all of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it is our policy to make sufficient cash distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our status as a reit under the code and to avoid corporate income and excise taxes on undistributed income 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business plan  we expect that the primary market risk to which we will be exposed is interest rate risk 
in addition to changes in interest rates  the value of our facilities will be subject to fluctuations based on changes in local and regional economic conditions and changes in the ability of our tenants to generate profits  all of which may affect our ability to refinance our debt if necessary 
the changes in the value of our facilities would be reflected also by changes in cap rates  which is measured by the current base rent divided by the current market value of a facility 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase by  the increase in annual interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately  per year 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt decrease by  the decrease in interest expense on our variable rate debt would increase future earnings and cash flows by approximately  per year 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under our variable rate debt remains approximately million  the balance at march  we currently have no assets denominated in a foreign currency  nor do we have any assets located outside of the united states 
our exchangeable notes are exchangeable into shares of our stock for each  note 
this equates to a conversion price of per share 
this conversion price adjusts based on a formula which considers increases to our dividend subsequent to the issuance of the notes in november  our dividend declared in november   went ex dividend on december   at which time our conversion price adjusted to per share 
future changes to the conversion price will depend on our level of dividends which cannot be predicted at this time 
we have declared a dividend of 
cents per share to stockholders of record on march  any adjustments for dividend increases until the notes are settled in will affect the price of the notes and the number of shares for which they will eventually be settled 
at the time we issued the exchangeable notes  we also entered into a capped call or call spread transaction 
the effect of this transaction was to increase the conversion price from to 
as a result  our shareholders will not experience any dilution until our share price exceeds 
if our share price exceeds that price  the result would be that we would issue additional shares of common stock 
at a price of per share  we would be required to issue an additional  shares 
at per share  we would be required to issue an additional two million shares
