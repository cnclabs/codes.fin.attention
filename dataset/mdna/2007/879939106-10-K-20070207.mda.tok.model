the projections and statements contained in these forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
all statements not based on historical fact are forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act of  following are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements  including but not limited to the following our belief that we are continuing to see strong demand for our services and that sales cycles are shortening  risks associated with successfully integrating dac which we acquired on june  and achieving anticipated future revenue growth  profitability and synergies  estimated revenue from new  renewed and expanded client business as volumes may not materialize as forecasted or be sufficient to achieve our business outlook  achieving continued profit improvement in our international bpo operations  the ability to close and ramp new business opportunities that are currently being pursued or that are in the final stages with existing and or potential clients in order to achieve our business outlook  our ability to execute our growth plans  including sales of new products such as ondemand  our ability to achieve our year end financial goals  including those set forth in our business outlook  the possibility of our database marketing and consulting segment not increasing revenue  lowering costs  or returning to profitability resulting in an impairment of its million of goodwill  the possibility of lower revenue or price pressure from our clients experiencing a business downturn or merger in their business  greater than anticipated competition in the bpo services market  causing adverse pricing and more stringent contractual terms  risks associated with losing or not renewing client relationships  particularly large client agreements  or early termination of a client agreement  the risk of losing clients due to consolidation in the industries we serve  consumers concerns or adverse publicity regarding our clients products  our ability to find cost effective locations  obtain favorable lease terms and build or retrofit facilities in a timely and economic manner  risks associated with business interruption due to weather  pandemic  or terrorist related events  risks associated with attracting and retaining cost effective labor at our delivery centers  the possibility of additional asset impairments and restructuring charges  risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  economic or political changes affecting the countries in which we operate  changes in accounting policies and practices promulgated by standard setting bodies  and new legislation or government regulation that impacts the bpo and customer management industry 
executive overview we serve our clients through two primary businesses  bpo and database marketing and consulting 
our bpo business provides outsourced business process  customer management and marketing services for a variety of industries through delivery centers throughout the world and represents approximately of total revenue 
when we begin operations in a new country  we determine whether the country is intended to primarily serve us based clients  in which case we include the country in our north american bpo segment  or if the country is intended to serve both domestic clients from that country and us based clients  in which case we include the country in our international bpo segment 
this is consistent with our management of the business  internal financial reporting structure and operating focus 
operations for each segment of our bpo business are conducted in the following countries north american bpo international bpo united states argentina canada australia india brazil philippines china england germany malaysia mexico new zealand northern ireland scotland singapore spain on june   we acquired percent of the outstanding common shares of dac 
dac is a provider of outsourced direct marketing services to third parties in the us and its acquisition is consistent with our strategy to grow and focus on providing outsourced marketing  sales and bpo solutions to large multinational clients 
dac is included in our north american bpo segment 
the acquisition of dac contributed approximately million of revenue and was slightly accretive to earnings during the last six months of  which were the first six months of combined operations 
database marketing and consulting provides outsourced database management  direct marketing and related customer acquisition and retention services for automobile dealerships and manufacturers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our preparation of segment information 
bpo services the bpo business generates revenue based primarily on the amount of time our associates devote to a client s program 
we primarily focus on large global corporations in the following industries  automotive  communications and media  financial services  healthcare  government  logistics  retail  technology and travel 
revenue is recognized as services are provided 
the majority of our revenue is from multi year contracts and we expect it will continue to be 
however  we do provide certain client programs on a short term basis 
we have historically experienced annual attrition of existing client programs of approximately to of our revenue 
attrition of existing client programs during was  excluding the short term contract with the us government during the third and fourth quarters of however  during  we experienced net attrition of existing client programs of attrition of existing client programs was greater than the expansion of existing client programs whereas during  excluding the short term contract with the us government  we experienced net growth of existing client programs of as expansion of existing client programs exceeded attrition of existing client programs 
we believe this trend is attributable to our investment in an account management and operations team focused on client service 
our invoice terms with clients typically range from to days  with longer terms in europe 
the bpo industry is highly competitive 
we compete primarily with the in house business processing operations of our current and potential clients 
we also compete with certain companies that provide bpo on an outsourced basis 
our ability to sell our existing services or gain acceptance for new products or services is challenged by the competitive nature of the industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to sell services to new clients  renew relationships with existing clients  or gain client acceptance of our new products 
we have improved our revenue and profitability in both the north american and the international bpo segments by selling new business to existing clients  securing new clients  continuing to focus sales efforts on large  complex  multi center bpo opportunities  differentiating our products and services from those of our competitors by developing and offering new solutions to clients  exploring merger and acquisition opportunities  expansion of off shore capabilities to support client growth  increasing sales to absorb unused capacity in existing global delivery centers  reducing costs and continued focus on cost controls  and managing the workforce in our delivery centers in a cost effective manner 
our ability to enter into new or renew multi year contracts  particularly large complex opportunities  is dependent upon the macroeconomic environment in general and the specific industry environments in which our clients operate 
a weakening of the us or the global economy could lengthen sales cycles or cause delays in closing new business opportunities 
our potential clients typically obtain bids from multiple vendors and evaluate many factors in selecting a service provider including  among other factors  the scope of services offered  the service record of the vendor and price 
we generally price our bids with a long term view of profitability and  accordingly  we consider all of our fixed and variable costs in developing our bids 
we believe that our competitors  at times  may bid business based upon a short term view  as opposed to our longer term view  resulting in a lower price bid 
while we believe our clients perceptions of the value we provide results in our being successful in certain competitive bid situations  there are often situations where a potential client may prefer a lower cost 
our industry is labor intensive and the majority of our operating costs relate to wages  employee benefits and employment taxes 
an improvement in the local or global economies where our delivery centers are located could lead to increased labor related costs 
in addition  our industry experiences high personnel turnover and the length of training time required to implement new programs continues to increase due to increased complexities of our clients businesses 
this may create challenges if we obtain several significant new clients or implement several new  large scale programs and need to recruit  hire and train qualified personnel at an accelerated rate 
as discussed above  our profitability is influenced  in part  by the number of new or expanded client programs 
we defer revenue for the initial training that occurs upon commencement of a new client contract start up training if that training is billed separately to the client 
accordingly  the corresponding training costs  consisting primarily of labor and related expenses  are also deferred 
in these circumstances  both the training revenue and costs are amortized straight line over the life of the contract 
in situations where start up training is not billed separately  but rather included in the production rates paid by the client over the life of the contract  no deferral is necessary as the revenue is recognized over the life of the contract and the associated training expenses are expensed as incurred 
for the year ended december   we incurred million of training expenses for client programs for which we did not separately bill start up training 
the following summarizes the impact of the deferred start up training for the years ended december   and amounts in thousands year ended december  income income income from from from revenue operations revenue operations revenue operations amounts deferred due to new business amortization of prior period deferrals net increase decrease for the period as of december   we had million of net deferred start up training that will be amortized straight line over the remaining life of the corresponding client contracts approximately months 
we may have difficulties managing the timeliness of launching new or expanded client programs and the associated internal allocation of personnel and resources 
this could cause a decline or delay in recognition of revenues and an increase in costs  either of which could adversely affect our operating results 
in the event we do not successfully expand our capacity or launch new or expanded client programs  we may be unable to achieve the revenue and profitability targets set forth in the business outlook section below 
quarterly  we review our capacity utilization and projected demand for future capacity 
in conjunction with these reviews  we may decide to consolidate or close under performing delivery centers  including those impacted by the loss of a major client program  in order to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
in addition  because clients may request that we serve their customers from international delivery centers with lower prevailing labor rates  in the future we may decide to close one or more of our delivery centers  even though it is generating positive cash flow  because we believe the future profits from conducting such work outside the current delivery center may more than compensate for the one time charges related to closing the facility 
our profitability is significantly influenced by our ability to increase capacity utilization in our delivery centers 
we attempt to minimize the financial impact resulting from idle capacity when planning the development and opening of new delivery centers or the expansion of existing delivery centers 
as such  management considers numerous factors that affect capacity utilization  including anticipated expirations  reductions  terminations  or expansions of existing programs and the potential size and timing of new client contracts that we expect to obtain 
we continue to win new business with both new and existing clients 
as a result  we expanded our capacity in by approximately  workstations in argentina  canada and the philippines 
to respond more rapidly to changing market demands  to implement new programs and to expand existing programs  we may be required to commit to additional capacity prior to the contracting of additional business  which may result in idle capacity 
this is largely due to the significant time required to negotiate and execute a client contract as we concentrate our marketing efforts toward obtaining large  complex bpo programs 
we internally target capacity utilization in our delivery centers at to of our available workstations 
as of december   the overall capacity utilization in our multi client centers was 
the table below presents workstation data for our multi client centers as of december  and dedicated and managed centers  workstations are excluded from the workstation data as unused workstations in these facilities are not available for sale 
our utilization percentage is defined as the total number of utilized production workstations compared to the total number of available production workstations 
we may change the designation of shared or dedicated centers based on the normal changes in our business environment and client needs 
december  december  total total production in production in workstations in use use workstations in use use north american bpo international bpo total as shown above  there was a significant increase in the total production workstations resulting from our growth plans see discussion under bpo above  a corresponding increase in the number of production workstations in use and an increase in the utilization percentage 
database marketing and consulting the revenue from this segment is generated utilizing a database and contact system to promote the sales and service business of automobile dealership customers using targeted marketing solutions through the phone  mail  e mail and the web 
as of december   our database marketing and consulting segment had relationships with more than  automobile dealers representing different automotive brand names 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from month to month to months 
for a few major automotive manufacturers  the automotive manufacturer collects from the individual automobile dealers on our behalf 
our average collection period is to days 
a combination of factors contributed to this segment generating a loss from operations of approximately million after corporate allocations for the year ended december  for  we modified our agreement with ford whose dealers represented approximately of the revenue of our database marketing and consulting segment for the year ended december   to provide services to ford s automotive dealerships on a preferred basis  rather than on an exclusive basis 
the new agreement gives us flexibility to customize service offerings and the ability to contract directly with ford s dealerships under our defined terms and conditions 
primarily due to ford offering a competing product  our dealer attrition rate has exceeded our new account growth in  resulting in a significant decrease in revenue from the prior year 
the clients of our database marketing and consulting segment  as well as our joint venture with ford  come from the automotive industry 
the us automotive industry is currently reporting declining earnings  which may result in client losses  lower volumes  or additional pricing pressures on our operations 
as we work to implement the plans outlined above to return this segment to profitability  we anticipate this segment will incur a loss from operations in the first quarter of in the range of million to million 
in  we plan to continue our focus on the following to return this segment to profitability diversifying our client base by establishing relations with new automotive manufacturers and dealer groups  reducing our client attrition rate by improving customer service and increasing customer contact  and continuing to manage costs through operational efficiencies 
overall as shown in the results of operations we have improved income from operations for our north american and international bpo segments 
the increases are attributable to a variety of factors such as expansion of work on certain client programs  our multi phased cost reduction plan  transitioning work on certain client programs to lower cost operating centers  increased capacity utilization and improving individual client program profit margins and or eliminating such programs 
as we pursue merger and acquisition opportunities  it is possible that the contemplated benefits of any future acquisitions may not materialize within the expected time periods or to the extent anticipated 
critical to the success of our acquisition strategy in the future is the orderly  effective integration of acquired businesses into our organization 
if this integration is unsuccessful  our business may be adversely impacted 
there is also the risk that our valuation assumptions and models for an acquisition may be overly optimistic or incorrect 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition for each client arrangement  we determine whether evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of our service has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
if all criteria are met  we recognize revenue at the time services are performed 
if any of these criteria are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as all of the criteria are met 
our bpo segments recognize revenue under three models production rate revenue is recognized based on the billable time or transactions of each associate  as defined in the client contract 
the rate per billable time or transaction is based on a predetermined contractual rate 
this contractual rate can fluctuate based on our performance against certain pre determined criteria related to quality and performance 
performance based under performance based arrangements  we are paid by our clients based on achievement of certain levels of sales or other client determined criteria specified in the client contract 
we recognize performance based revenue by measuring our actual results against the performance criteria specified in the contracts 
amounts collected from clients prior to the performance of services are recorded as customer advances 
hybrid under hybrid models we are paid a fixed fee or production element as well as a performance based element 
certain client programs provide for increases or decreases to monthly billings based upon whether we meet or exceed certain performance criteria as set forth in the contract 
increases or decreases to monthly billings arising from such contract terms are reflected in revenue as earned or incurred 
our database marketing and consulting segment recognizes revenue when services are rendered 
most agreements require the billing of predetermined monthly rates 
where the contractual billing periods do not coincide with the periods over which services are provided  we recognize revenue straight line over the life of the contract typically six to months 
from time to time  we make certain expenditures related to acquiring contracts recorded as contract acquisition costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
those expenditures are capitalized and amortized in proportion to the initial expected future revenue from the contract  which in most cases results in straight line amortization over the life of the contract 
amortization of these costs is recorded as a reduction of revenue 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future income tax consequences of transactions that have been included in the consolidated financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future projected taxable income 
as required by sfas  we continually review the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in future tax periods under the more likely than not criteria 
in making this judgment sfas requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  should be considered to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
as of december   we had million of deferred tax assets after an million valuation allowance and net deferred tax assets after deferred tax liabilities of million related to the us and international tax jurisdictions whose recoverability is dependent upon future profitability 
in the future  our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
our effective tax rate is affected by the proportion of revenues and income before taxes in the various domestic and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
further  we are subject to changing tax laws  regulations and interpretations in multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  as well as the requirements  pronouncements and rulings of certain tax  regulatory and accounting organizations 
we estimate our annual effective tax rate each quarter based on a combination of actual and forecasted results of subsequent quarters 
consequently  significant changes in our actual quarterly or forecasted results may impact the effective tax rate for the current or future periods 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas fin will be effective for our fiscal year 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of the impact fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts to reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
each quarter  management reviews the receivables on an account by account basis and assigns a probability of collection 
management s judgment is used in assessing the probability of collection 
factors considered in making this judgment include  among other things  the age of the identified receivable  client financial condition  previous client payment history and any recent communications with the client 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of our individual delivery centers in accordance with sfas sfas requires that a long lived asset group be reviewed for impairment only when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group may not be recoverable 
when the operating results of a delivery center have deteriorated to the point it is likely that losses will continue for the foreseeable future  or we expect that a delivery center will be closed or otherwise disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life  we select the delivery center for further review 
for delivery centers selected for further review  we estimate the probability weighted future cash flows  using ebitda see presentation of non gaap measurements as a surrogate for cash flows  resulting from operating the delivery center over its useful life 
significant judgment is involved in projecting future capacity utilization  pricing  labor costs and the estimated useful life of the delivery center 
we do not subject to the same test delivery centers that have been operated for less than two years or those delivery centers that have been impaired within the past two years the two year rule because we believe sufficient time is necessary to establish a market presence and build a client base for such new or modified delivery centers in order to adequately assess recoverability 
however  such delivery centers are nonetheless evaluated in case other factors would indicate an impairment had occurred 
for impaired delivery centers  we write the assets down to their estimated fair market value 
if the assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove insufficient  the fair market value estimate of the delivery centers may be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed fair market value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis of the impairment evaluation assuming that the future results were less than the two year forecasted ebitda for all physical delivery centers containing company assets excluding india  which was impaired during 
as shown in the table below  the analysis indicates that an impairment of approximately million an increase of million from the third quarter of would arise 
however  for the delivery centers tested  the current probability weighted projection scenarios indicated that impairment had not occurred as of december  amounts in thousands  except number of delivery centers additional impairment number of under net book delivery sensitivity value centers test delivery centers tested based on the two year rule positive cash flow in the period negative cash flow in the period subtotal delivery centers not tested based on the two year rule positive cash flow in the period negative cash flow in the period subtotal total positive cash flow in the period negative cash flow in the period grand total we also assess the realizable value of capitalized software development costs on a quarterly basis based upon current estimates of future cash flows from services utilizing the underlying software principally utilized by our database marketing and consulting segment 
no impairment had occurred as of december  goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the segment level for the database marketing and consulting segment which consists of one subsidiary company and for reporting units one level below the segment level for the other two segments in accordance with sfas impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales  or valuations of other similar businesses 
our policy is to test goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year unless an indicator of impairment arises during a prior period 
the most significant assumptions used in these analyses are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our internal forecasting model such as projected capacity utilization  projected changes in the prices we charge for our services and projected labor costs 
we then use a discount rate we consider appropriate for the country where the business unit is providing services 
if actual results are less than the assumptions used in performing the impairment test  the fair value of the reporting units may be significantly lower  causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
based on the analyses performed in the fourth quarter of  there was no impairment to the december  goodwill balance of our north american and international bpo segments of million and million  respectively 
if projected revenue used in the analysis of goodwill was less than forecast the projections assumed revenue growth rates ranging from to per annum over a three year period  there would still be no impairment to goodwill 
our database marketing and consulting segment has experienced operating losses 
we have plans to improve the future profitability of this segment 
the goodwill for our database marketing and consulting segment is million as of december  as a result of this segment s financial performance in the year ended december   we updated our cash flow analyses which assume annual revenue increases approximately percent per annum  calculated on a smaller revenue base than our historical revenue base and following our planned efforts to sell business to non ford dealers 
our analyses indicated that an impairment in goodwill had not occurred as of december  in addition  we engaged an independent appraisal firm to assess the fair value of this segment 
the independent firm also indicated that no impairment of goodwill had occurred as of december  however  a sensitivity analysis of the forecast indicated that  without considering corresponding reductions in future operating expenses that we would implement in the event of a further revenue decline  it would not take a material change in the revenue forecast for an impairment to arise 
restructuring liability we routinely assess the profitability and utilization of our delivery centers and existing markets 
in some cases  we have chosen to close under performing delivery centers and complete reductions in workforce to enhance future profitability 
we follow sfas  which specifies that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than upon commitment to a plan 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing delivery centers is the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant centers  which we determine based on a third party broker s assessment of our ability to successfully negotiate early termination agreements with landlords and or our ability to sublease the facility 
if our assumptions regarding early termination and the timing and amounts of sublease payments prove to be inaccurate  we may be required to record additional losses  or conversely  a future gain 
adoption of sfas no 
r and equity based compensation expense during the first quarter of  we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r applying the modified prospective method 
sfas r requires all equity based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income based on the grant date fair value of the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for equity based awards under the intrinsic value method  which followed recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and equity based compensation was included as pro forma disclosure within the notes to the financial statements 
we did not modify the terms of any previously granted options in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r 
income from operations for the year ended december  was adversely affected by the impact of equity based compensation due to the implementation of sfas r 
for the year ended december   we recorded expense of million for equity based compensation 
we expect that equity based compensation expense for fiscal and from existing awards will be approximately million and million  respectively 
however  any future significant awards granted or required changes in the estimated forfeiture rates may impact this estimate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
contingencies we record a liability in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies for pending litigation and claims where losses are both probable and reasonably estimable 
each quarter  management  with the advice of legal counsel  reviews all litigation and claims on a case by case basis and assigns probability of loss and range of loss based upon the assessments of in house counsel and outside counsel  as appropriate 
explanation of key metrics and other items cost of services cost of services principally include costs incurred in connection with our bpo operations and database marketing services  including direct labor  telecommunications  printing  postage  sales and use tax and certain fixed costs associated with delivery centers 
in addition  cost of services includes income related to grants we may receive from time to time from local or state governments as an incentive to locate delivery centers in their jurisdictions which reduce the cost of services for those facilities 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses primarily include costs associated with administrative services such as sales  marketing  product development  legal settlements  legal  information systems including core technology and telephony infrastructure and accounting and finance 
it also includes equity based compensation expense  outside professional fees ie legal and accounting services  building maintenance expense for non delivery center facilities and other items associated with general business administration 
restructuring charges  net restructuring charges  net primarily include costs incurred in conjunction with reductions in force or decisions to exit facilities  including termination benefits and lease liabilities  net of expected sublease rentals 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense and amortization of debt issuance costs associated with our grants  debt and capitalized lease obligations 
other income the main components of other income are miscellaneous receipts not directly related to our operating activities  such as foreign exchange transaction gains and corporate legal settlements 
other expenses the main components of other expenses are expenditures not directly related to our operating activities  such as corporate legal settlements and foreign exchange transaction losses 
presentation of non gaap measurements free cash flow free cash flow is a non gaap liquidity measurement 
we believe that free cash flow is useful to our investors because it measures  during a given period  the amount of cash generated that is available for debt obligations and investments other than purchases of property  plant and equipment 
free cash flow is not a measure determined by gaap and should not be considered a substitute for income from operations  net income  net cash provided by operating activities  or any other measure determined in accordance with gaap 
we believe this non gaap liquidity measure is useful  in addition to the most directly comparable gaap measure of net cash provided by operating activities  because free cash flow includes investments in operational assets 
free cash flow does not represent residual cash available for discretionary expenditures  since it includes cash required for debt service 
free cash flow also excludes cash that may be necessary for acquisitions  investments and other needs that may arise 
the following table reconciles free cash flow to net cash provided by operating activities for our consolidated results amounts in thousands year ended december  free cash flow purchases of property  plant and equipment net cash provided by operating activities we discuss factors affecting free cash flow between periods in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
ebit and ebitda ebit is defined as net income before interest and taxes 
ebitda is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization for the period to ebit 
ebit and ebitda are not defined gaap measures and should not be considered alternatives to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of operating performance  nor an alternative to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity 
because others may not calculate ebit and ebitda in the same manner as teletech  the ebit and ebitda information presented below may not be comparable to similar presentations by others 
however  we believe that ebit and ebitda provide investors and management with a valuable and alternative method for assessing our operating results 
management evaluates the performance of our subsidiaries and operating segments based on ebit and believes that ebit is useful to investors to demonstrate the operational profitability of our business segments by excluding interest and taxes  which are generally accounted for across the entire company on a consolidated basis 
ebit is also one of the measures management uses to determine resource allocations and incentive compensation 
further  we use ebitda to evaluate the profitability and cash flow of our delivery centers when testing the impairment of long lived assets 
the following table reconciles net income to ebit and ebitda for our consolidated results amounts in thousands years ended december  net income interest income interest expense provision for income taxes ebit depreciation and amortization ebitda results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following tables are presented to facilitate management s discussion and analysis

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during were existing cash balances  cash generated from operations and borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
we expect that our future working capital  capital expenditures and debt service requirements will be satisfied primarily from existing cash balances and cash generated from operations 
our ability to generate positive future operating and net cash flows is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to sell new business  expand existing client relationships and efficiently manage our operating costs 
the amount of capital required in will also depend on our levels of investment in infrastructure necessary to maintain  upgrade  or replace existing assets 
our working capital and capital expenditure requirements could increase materially in the event of acquisitions or joint ventures  among other factors 
these factors could require that we raise additional capital in the future 
the following discussion highlights our cash flow activities during the years ended december   and cash and cash equivalents we consider all liquid investments purchased within days of their maturity to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities we reinvest our cash flows from operating activities in our business or in the purchases of treasury stock 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by operating activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase from to resulted from increased net income as well as changes in working capital accounts 
the decrease from to resulted from changes in working capital accounts  primarily due to increased accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable primarily resulted from the ramp up of the short term us government program discussed previously and other new or expanded clients that ramped in the fourth quarter of cash flows from investing activities we reinvest cash in our business primarily to grow our client base and to expand our infrastructure 
for the years  and  we reported net cash flows used in investing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase from to resulted from the acquisition of dac and expanded capital expenditures for our embedded client base as well as new client contracts 
the amount from to remained relatively consistent 
cash flows from financing activities for the years  and  we reported net cash flows provided by used in financing activities of million  million and million  respectively 
the change from to resulted from a decrease in the purchase of treasury stock and increased exercises of stock options 
the change from to relates primarily to the fact that in we restructured our debt and there was no such transaction in free cash flow free cash flow see presentation of non gaap measurements for definition of free cash flow was million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
the increase from to primarily resulted from higher cash flows from operations  which outpaced the increase in capital expenditures 
the decrease from to resulted from lower cash flows from operations due to increased accounts receivable balances from the ramp up of the short term government program discussed above 
obligations and future capital requirements future maturities of our outstanding debt and contractual obligations are summarized as follows less than to to over year years years years total line of credit grant advances purchase obligations operating lease commitments total reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets purchase obligations occasionally we contract with certain of our communications clients which currently represents approximately of our annual revenue to provide us with telecommunication services 
we believe these contracts are negotiated on an arms length basis and may be negotiated at different times and with different legal entities 
future capital requirements we expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
of the expected capital expenditures in are related to the opening and or expansion of delivery centers and relates to the maintenance capital required for existing assets and internal technology projects 
the anticipated level of capital expenditures is primarily dependent upon new client contracts and the corresponding requirements for additional delivery center capacity as well as enhancements to our technological infrastructure 
we may consider restructurings  dispositions  mergers  acquisitions and other similar transactions 
such transactions could include the transfer  sale or acquisition of significant assets  businesses or interests  including joint ventures  or the incurrence  assumption  or refinancing of indebtedness and could be material to the consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of our operations 
the launch of large client contracts may result in negative working capital because of the time period between incurring the costs for training and launching the program and the beginning of the accounts receivable collection process 
as a result  periodically we may generate negative cash flows from operating activities 
debt instruments and related covenants we discuss debt instruments and related covenants in note to the consolidated financial statements 
client concentration our five largest clients accounted for  and of our revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  these five clients accounted for an even greater proportional share of our consolidated earnings 
the profitability of services provided to these clients varies greatly based upon the specific contract terms with any particular client 
in addition  clients may adjust business volumes served by us based on their business requirements 
the relative contribution of any single client to consolidated earnings is not always proportional to the relative revenue contribution on a consolidated basis 
we believe the risk of this concentration is mitigated  in part  by the long term contracts we have with our largest clients 
although certain client contracts may be terminated for convenience by either party  this risk is mitigated  in part  by the service level disruptions that would arise for our clients 
the contracts with our five largest clients expire between and additionally  a particular client can have multiple contracts with different expiration dates 
we have historically renewed most of our contracts with our largest clients 
however  there is no assurance that future contracts will be renewed  or if renewed  will be on terms as favorable as the existing contracts 
recently issued accounting pronouncements we discuss the potential impact of recent accounting pronouncements in note and note to the consolidated financial statements 
business outlook for  we estimate that revenue will grow approximately percent over as we focus on achieving our previously stated goal of reaching a billion revenue run rate by the fourth quarter furthermore  we believe that fourth quarter operating margin will increase to percent  excluding unusual charges  if any 
for  we believe that revenue will grow between and and operating margin will improve by approximately basis points over item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  consolidated results of operations  or consolidated cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in us interest rates  libor and foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
as of december   we had entered into financial hedge instruments with several financial institutions to manage and reduce the impact of changes  principally the us canadian dollar exchange rates 
interest rate risk the interest rate on our credit facility is variable based upon the prime rate and libor and  therefore  is affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of december   there was a million outstanding balance under the credit facility 
if the prime rate or libor increased basis points  there would not be a material impact to our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency risk we have operations in argentina  australia  brazil  canada  china  england  germany  india  malaysia  mexico  new zealand  northern ireland  the philippines  scotland  singapore and spain 
the expenses from these operations and in some cases the revenue  are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposures to changes in exchange rates 
as a result  we may experience substantial foreign currency translation gains or losses due to the volatility of other currencies compared to the us dollar  which may positively or negatively affect our results of operations attributed to these subsidiaries 
for the years ended december  and  revenue from non us countries represented and of our consolidated revenue  respectively 
a global business strategy for us is to serve certain clients from delivery centers located in other foreign countries  including argentina  brazil  canada  india  malaysia  mexico and the philippines  in order to leverage lower operating costs in these foreign countries 
in order to mitigate the risk of these foreign currencies from strengthening against the functional currency of the contracting subsidiary  which thereby decreases the economic benefit of performing work in these countries  we may hedge a portion  though not  of the foreign currency exposure related to client programs served from these foreign countries 
while our hedging strategy can protect us from adverse changes in foreign currency rates in the short term  an overall strengthening of the foreign currencies would adversely impact margins in the segments of the contracting subsidiary over the long term 
the majority of this exposure is related to work performed from delivery centers located in canada and the philippines 
during the years ended december   and  the canadian dollar appreciated against the us dollar by  and  respectively 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our canadian subsidiary to acquire a total of million canadian dollars through june at a fixed price in us dollars not to exceed million 
however  certain contracts  representing million in canadian dollars  give us the right but not obligation to purchase the canadian dollars 
if the canadian dollar depreciates relative to the contracted exchange rate  we will elect to purchase the canadian dollars at the then beneficial market exchange rate 
during the years ended december  and  the philippine peso appreciated against the us dollar by and  respectively  and during the year ended december   the philippine peso depreciated by 
we have contracted with several financial institutions on behalf of our philippine subsidiary to acquire a total of billion philippine pesos through october at a fixed price of million us dollars 
as of december   we had total derivative assets and liabilities associated with foreign exchange contracts of million and million  respectively 
the canadian dollar derivative assets and liabilities represented million and million  respectively of the consolidated balance 
further  of the asset value and of the liability balance  settles within the next twelve months 
the philippine peso derivative assets represented million of the consolidated balance 
further  of the asset value settles within the next twelve months 
if the us canadian dollar or us dollar philippine peso exchange rate were to increase or decrease by from current period end levels  we would incur a material gain or loss on the contracts 
however  any gain or loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains or losses in our underlying exposures 
other than the transactions hedged as discussed above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the majority of the transactions of our us and foreign operations are denominated in the respective local currency while some transactions are denominated in other currencies 
for example  the intercompany transactions that are expected to be settled are denominated in the local currency of the billing subsidiary 
since the accounting records of our foreign operations are kept in the respective local currency  any transactions denominated in other currencies are accounted for in the respective local currency at the time of the transaction 
upon settlement of such a transaction  any foreign currency gain or loss results in an adjustment to income 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities related to these types of foreign currency risks because we believe them to be insignificant as we endeavor to settle these accounts on a timely basis 
fair value of debt and equity securities we did not have any investments in debt or equity securities as of december
