executive overview this executive overview only includes what management considers to be the most important information and analysis for evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
it provides the context for the discussion and analysis of the financial statements which follows and does not disclose every item bearing on our financial condition and operating performance 
general we are the leading provider of helicopter services to the worldwide offshore energy industry based on the number of aircraft operated 
we are one of two helicopter service providers to the offshore energy industry with global operations 
we have major operations in the us gulf of mexico and the north sea  and operations in most of the other major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including alaska  australia  mexico  nigeria  russia and trinidad 
we have a long history in the helicopter services industry  with our two principal legacy companies  bristow helicopters ltd 
and offshore logistics  inc  having been founded in and  respectively 
we conduct our business in two segments helicopter services and production management services 
the helicopter services segment operations are conducted through three divisions  western hemisphere  eastern hemisphere and global training  and through eight business units within those divisions western hemisphere north america south and central america eastern hemisphere europe west africa southeast asia other international eh centralized operations global training bristow academy we provide helicopter services to a broad base of major  independent  international and national energy companies 
customers charter our helicopters to transport personnel between onshore bases and offshore platforms  drilling rigs and installations 
a majority of our helicopter revenue is attributable to oil and gas production activities  which have historically provided a more stable source of revenue than exploration and development related activities 
as of march   we operated aircraft including aircraft owned  leased aircraft and aircraft operated for one of our customers  of the owned aircraft are held for sale and our unconsolidated affiliates operated an additional aircraft in addition to those aircraft leased from us 
in fiscal year  our helicopter services segment contributed approximately of our gross revenue 
on april   we acquired all of the common equity of hai  a leading flight training provider with operations located in titusville  florida  and concord  california  for million in cash 
we also assumed million in debt as part of this transaction 
upon purchase  hai was renamed bristow academy  which  with our existing training facilities in norwich  england  formed a central core of our new global training division within the helicopter services segment beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year bristow academy operates aircraft including owned and leased aircraft and employs people  including flight instructors and is the only school approved to provide helicopter flight training to the commercial pilot level both by the faa and the european joint aviation authority 
the global training division will support  coordinate  standardize  and in the case of the bristow academy schools  directly manage all flight and maintenance training activities within the helicopter services segment 
we are also a leading provider of production management services for oil and gas production facilities in the us gulf of mexico 
our services include furnishing specialized production operations personnel  engineering services  production operating services  paramedic services and providing marine and helicopter transportation of personnel and supplies between onshore bases and offshore facilities 
in connection with these activities  our production management services segment uses our helicopter services 
we also handle regulatory and production reporting for some of our customers 
as of march   we managed or had personnel assigned to production facilities in the us gulf of mexico 
the chart below presents the number of helicopters in our fleet and their distribution among the business units of our helicopter services segment as of march   the number of helicopters which we had on order or under option as of march   and the percentage of gross revenues which each of our segments and business units provided during fiscal year for additional information regarding our commitments and options to acquire aircraft  see liquidity and capital resources future cash requirements capital commitments included elsewhere in this annual report 
aircraft in fleet percentage of fiscal year revenues helicopters small medium large fixed wing total helicopter services north america south and central america europe west africa southeast asia other international eh centralized operations production management total aircraft not currently in fleet on order under option we expect that the additional aircraft on order and any aircraft we acquire pursuant to options will generally be deployed evenly across our global business units  but with a bias towards those units where we expect higher growth  such as our other international and southeast asia units 
the following chart presents an analysis of our aircraft orders and options during the last three fiscal years three months ended june  september  december  march  orders options orders options orders options orders options beginning of quarter aircraft delivered aircraft ordered new options orders converted to options expired options end of quarter our operating revenue depends on the demand for our services and the pricing terms of our contracts 
we measure the demand for our helicopter services in flight hours 
demand for our services depends on the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
we believe that our customers exploration and development activities are influenced by actual and expected trends in commodity prices for oil and gas 
exploration and development activities generally use medium size and larger aircraft on which we typically earn higher margins 
we believe that production related activities are less sensitive to variances in commodity prices  and accordingly  provide more stable activity levels and revenue streams 
we estimate that a majority of our operating revenue from helicopter services is related to the production activities of the oil and gas companies 
helicopter services are seasonal in nature  as our flight activities are influenced by the length of daylight hours and weather conditions 
the worst of these conditions typically occurs during the winter months when our ability to safely fly and our customers ability to safely conduct their operations  is inhibited 
accordingly  our flight activity is generally lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our helicopter contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
generally  our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics 
in addition  our standard rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally charged to the customer 
we also derive revenue from reimbursements for third party out of pocket costs such as certain landing and navigation costs  consultant salaries  travel and accommodation costs  and dispatcher charges 
the costs incurred that are rebilled to our customers are presented as reimbursable expense and the related revenue is presented as reimbursable revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
our helicopter contracts generally provide that the customer will reimburse us for cost increases associated with the contract and are cancelable by the customer with notice of generally days in the us gulf of mexico  to days in europe and days in west africa 
in north america  we generally enter into short term contracts for twelve months or less  although we occasionally enter into longer term contracts 
in europe  contracts are longer term  generally between two and five years 
in south and central america  west africa  southeast asia and other international  contract length generally ranges from three to five years 
at the expiration of a contract  our customers often negotiate renewal terms with us for the next contract period 
in other instances  customers solicit new bids at the expiration of a contract 
contracts are generally awarded based on a number of factors  including price  quality of service  equipment and record of safety 
incumbent operators typically have a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on their relationship with the customer  knowledge of the site characteristics and understanding of the cost structure for the operations 
maintenance and repair expenses  training costs  employee wages and insurance premiums represent a significant portion of our overall expenses 
our production management costs also include contracted transportation services 
we expense maintenance and repair costs  including major aircraft component overhaul costs  as the costs are incurred 
as a result  our earnings in any given period are directly impacted by the amount of our maintenance and repair expenses for that period 
in certain instances  major aircraft components  primarily engines and transmissions  are maintained by third party vendors under contractual arrangements 
under these agreements  we are charged an agreed amount per hour of flying time 
as a result of local laws limiting foreign ownership of aviation companies  we conduct helicopter services in certain foreign countries through interests in affiliates  some of which are unconsolidated 
generally  we realize revenue from foreign operations by leasing aircraft and providing services and technical support to unconsolidated affiliates and non affiliated entities 
we also receive dividend income from the earnings of some of these entities 
for additional information about these unconsolidated affiliates  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
our strategy our goal is to advance our position as the leading helicopter services provider to the offshore energy industry 
we intend to employ the following strategies to achieve this goal strategically position our company as the preferred provider of helicopter services 
we position our company as the preferred provider of helicopter services by maintaining strong relationships with our customers and providing high quality service 
we focus on maintaining relationships with our customers local and corporate management 
we believe that this focus helps us to provide our customers with the right aircraft in the right place at the right time and to better anticipate customer needs  which in turn allows us to better manage our fleet 
we also leverage our close relationships with our customers to establish mutually beneficial operating practices and safety standards worldwide 
by applying standard operating and safety practices across our global operations  we are able to provide our customers with consistent  high quality service in each of their areas of operation 
by better understanding our customers needs and by virtue of our global operations and safety standards  we have effectively competed against other helicopter service providers based on customer service  safety and reliability  and not just price 
integrate our operations 
in fiscal year  we completed a number of changes in our business to integrate our global organization  and we intend to continue to identify and implement further integration opportunities 
these changes include changes in our senior management team  the integration of our operations among previously independently managed businesses  improvements in global asset allocation and other changes in our corporate operations 
we anticipate that these improvements will result in revenue growth  and may also generate cost savings 
grow our business internationally 
we plan to grow our business in most of the markets in which we operate 
we expect this growth to be particularly strong in international markets outside our three largest markets us gulf of mexico  north sea and nigeria  which represented of our fiscal year revenues 
although we have a footprint in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world  we have the opportunity to expand and deepen our presence in many of these markets  for example southeast asia 
we anticipate this growth to result primarily from the deployment of new aircraft into markets where we expect they will be most profitably employed  as well as by executing opportunistic acquisitions 
our acquisition related growth may include increasing our role and participation with existing unconsolidated affiliates and may include increasing our position in existing markets or expanding into new markets 
consistent with our desire to maintain a conservative use of leverage to fund growth  we raised million capital through the sale of equity securities in the offering of preferred stock completed in september and october as of march   we had commitments to purchase large  medium and small aircraft and options to purchase an additional large aircraft and an additional medium aircraft 
depending on market conditions  we may exercise these options to purchase aircraft or elect to expand our business through acquisition  including acquisitions under consideration or negotiation 
these strategic decisions would require us to access additional sources of capital 
our decision to use equity  debt or a combination of the two would depend on our financial position and market conditions at that time  but we currently expect to use debt financing 
market outlook we are currently experiencing significant demand for our helicopter services 
based on our current contract level and discussions with our customers about their needs for aircraft related to their oil and gas production and exploration plans  we anticipate the demand for aircraft services will continue at a very high level for the near term 
further  based on the projects planned by our customers in the markets in which we currently operate  we anticipate global demand for our services will grow in the long term and exceed the transportation capacity of the aircraft we and our competitors currently have in our fleets and on order 
in addition  this high level of demand has allowed us to increase the rates we charge for our services over the past several years 
we expect to see growth in demand for additional helicopter services  particularly in north and south america  west africa and southeast asia 
we also expect that the relative importance of our southeast asia and other international business units will continue to increase as the major oil and gas companies increasingly focus on prospects outside of north america and the north sea 
this growth will provide us with opportunities to add new aircraft to our fleet  as well as opportunities to redeploy aircraft from weaker markets into markets that will sustain higher rates for our services 
currently  helicopter manufacturers are indicating very limited supply availability during the next three years 
we expect that this tightness in aircraft availability from the manufacturers and the lack of suitable aircraft in the secondary market  coupled with the increase in demand for helicopter services  will result in upward pressure on the rates we charge for our services 
at the same time  we believe that our recent aircraft acquisitions and commitments position us to capture a portion of the upside created by the current market conditions 
we have made and are in the process of making a number of changes in our west africa business unit operations in nigeria 
this reorganization as well as periodic disruption to our operations related to civil unrest and violence have made and are expected to continue to make our operating results from nigeria unpredictable through at least the end of calendar year there has been a trend of major oil and gas companies outsourcing certain activities and transferring reserves located in the us gulf of mexico to smaller  independent oil and gas producers 
these trends have generated  and are expected to continue to generate  additional demand for our production management services  as smaller producers are more likely to require the operational and manpower support that our production management services segment provides

fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross revenue increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in gross revenue relates to an increase in gross revenue for our helicopter services segment  with improvements in revenue across all of our business units  most significantly for north america primarily resulting from increases in rates for certain contracts and an increase in utilization of our small aircraft in this market  europe primarily resulting from aircraft added to the market during fiscal year and west africa primarily resulting from an increase in rates under certain contracts and three new contracts 
the increase in gross revenue was also attributable to an increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers reimbursable revenue of million 
our operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
operating expense increased as a result of the increase in operating activity and the increase in out of pocket expense associated with reimbursable revenue  but also as a result of a higher level of maintenance activity on our aircraft and compensation costs driven by higher labor rates and additional personnel 
these additional operating expense items resulted in a decline in operating income for our north america business unit and a decline in operating margin for our north america and europe business units 
however  improved margins for most of our other business units and significant gains on asset dispositions in fiscal year compared to only a small gain on asset dispositions in fiscal year resulted in increases in our operating income and operating margin for fiscal year to million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  for fiscal year net income for the fiscal year of million represents a million increase from fiscal year this increase in net income was driven by the increase in operating income discussed above  increased earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  an increase in interest income and a decrease in interest expense  which was partially offset by foreign exchange losses of million in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange gains of million in fiscal year  and an increase in the provision for income taxes due to the additional tax expense related to the turbo engines  inc turbo asset sale see business unit operating results fiscal year compared to fiscal year helicopter services north america below  the increase in income during fiscal year and from an increase in the overall effective tax rate 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year our gross revenue increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase in gross revenue was noted in both our helicopter services segment and our production management services segment 
helicopter services contributed to most of the increase with improvements for north america resulting from an increase in flight hours and rates and improvements in europe resulting from higher rates and new contracts 
our operating expenses for fiscal year increased to million from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
the increase was primarily a result of higher costs associated with higher activity levels  higher labor costs  higher fuel rates which are generally recovered from our customers and higher professional fees related to the sec and doj investigations 
in addition  we had a gain on disposal of assets of million for fiscal year compared to a gain on disposal of assets of million for fiscal year as a result of the higher professional fees and lower gains on disposals of assets  our operating income and operating margin for fiscal year decreased to million and  respectively  compared to million and  respectively  for fiscal year net income for fiscal year of million represents a million increase from fiscal year this increase primarily resulted from the decrease in the overall effective tax rate from to  primarily due to the resolution of tax contingencies in fiscal year and foreign exchange gains of million in fiscal year compared to foreign exchange losses of million in fiscal year business unit operating results the following tables set forth certain operating information  which forms the basis for discussion of our helicopter services and production management services segments  and for the seven business units comprising our helicopter services segment 
beginning with this annual report  we have made changes to the manner in which intercompany lease charges and depreciation are presented within our segments 
intercompany lease revenues and expenses have been eliminated from our segment reporting  and depreciation expense of aircraft is presented in the segment that operates the aircraft 
intercompany lease revenue was previously included in gross revenue for the segment leasing the aircraft to other segments with the related lease and operating expenses being included in the segment operating the aircraft during the period 
also  depreciation expense associated with aircraft was previously included within operating expense of the segment leasing the aircraft to other segments versus the segment operating the aircraft

fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of the results of operations of our segments and business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under executive overview overview of operating results above 
helicopter services gross revenue for helicopter services increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of  and operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  an increase of 
this resulted in an operating margin of for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year helicopter services results are further explained below by business unit 
north america gross revenue for north america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  and flight activity increased by 
this increase in gross revenue is due to a rate increase in may of which was phased in during fiscal year  an additional rate increase for certain contracts which was phased in beginning in march  and an increase in the number of aircraft on month to month contracts for fiscal year although less of an impact in fiscal year  another increase became effective in march  which will be phased in during fiscal year operating expense for north america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to increased maintenance expense largely associated with the complete refurbishment of several aircraft in fiscal year  higher labor costs associated with the increase in flight activity and from the adoption of the new equity compensation accounting standard in fiscal year  and higher fuel costs associated with both the increase in flight activity and a higher average cost per gallon which we are generally able to recover from our customers 
our operating margin for north america decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year primarily due to the increase in maintenance and labor costs  and a high level of utilization of aircraft under contracts opposed to ad hoc work which earns higher margins 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  on november   we completed a sale of certain of the assets of our aircraft engine overhaul business  turbo  to timken alcor aerospace technologies  inc timken for approximately million million of which was received in cash upon closing of the transaction and million of which was received in cash in march  including estimated post closing adjustments 
turbo represented of our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal year south and central america gross revenue for south and central america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher revenue recognized in fiscal year upon receipt of cash from our joint venture in mexico and an increase in the number of aircraft operating in trinidad over fiscal year in mexico  a contract with pemex concluded in february as a result  our owned unconsolidated affiliate  hc  experienced difficulties during fiscal year in meeting its obligation to make lease rental payments to us and to another one of our unconsolidated affiliates  rlr 
as a result of uncertainties as to collectibility  lease revenues from hc are recognized as they are collected 
as of march   million of revenues billed but not collected from hc have not been recognized in our results  and our share of the equity in earnings of rlr has been reduced by million for revenues billed but not collected from hc 
during fiscal year  we recognized revenue of million upon receipt of payment from hc for amounts billed in fiscal year and recorded equity earnings from rlr of million related to the receipt of payment by rlr from hc for amounts billed in fiscal year operating expense for south and central america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to operating expense increases in trinidad as a result of additional aircraft in that market  which was almost fully offset by lower operating expense in other markets 
the largest of these decreases was noted in mexico  where overall flight activity has declined due to the conclusion of the pemex contract in february as a result of the increase in gross revenue while operating expense was substantially unchanged  the operating margin for this business unit increased significantly to for fiscal year from for fiscal year since the conclusion of the pemex contract in february  we took several actions to improve the financial condition and profitability of hc  including relocating several aircraft to other markets  restructuring our profit sharing arrangement with our partner  and completing a recapitalization of heliservicio on august  in june  heliservicio began providing and operating three medium helicopters in support of pemex s oil and gas operations under a two year contract 
we will continue to evaluate the improving results for hc to determine if and when we will change our accounting for this joint venture from the cash to accrual basis 
in march  we sold our ownership interest in a joint venture that operates in brazil to our partners in the joint venture  resulting in a pre tax gain of approximately million 
we anticipate that once our existing agreements expire that we will evaluate the alternatives for these aircraft  which include leasing to other customers in brazil  selling or relocating the aircraft 
therefore  we expect to experience a substantial reduction in business activity in brazil in future periods 
europe gross revenue for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the million increase in gross revenue for europe includes a million increase relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in gross revenue primarily relates to a increase in flight activity and an million increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers 
the majority of the increase in flight hours relates to new contracts within the north sea and an increase in our utilization per airframe 
operating expense for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the million increase in operating expense for europe includes a million increase relating to foreign exchange effects for fiscal year excluding this effect  the increase in operating expense primarily relates to an increase in activity in the north sea  increased maintenance costs  higher fuel rates  the impact of additions in personnel and salary increases  and the increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we are generally able to recover fuel cost increases from our customers 
as a result of the increases in maintenance costs and salaries and a higher level of utilization of aircraft under contracts opposed to ad hoc work which earns higher margins  operating margin for europe decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year we are currently involved in negotiations with unions representing our pilots and engineers in this market and we currently expect that labor rates under our existing contracts could increase starting in july through june we expect to be able to pass these costs on to our customers through rate increases as customer contracts come up for renewal 
in october  we were awarded an amendment and extension of our existing contract in the north sea with integrated aviation consortium for the provision of helicopter transportation services to offshore facilities both east and west of the shetland islands 
the amendment extends the contract until june and calls for the provision of five new sikorsky s helicopters to be delivered in the second and third quarters of fiscal year to replace the six asl super puma helicopters currently under contract  which we intend to re deploy to other markets 
in december  the provision for a sixth sikorsky s was confirmed and a related aircraft option was exercised 
in december  we were informed that we were not awarded the contract extension that would have commenced in mid to provide search and rescue services using seven s aircraft and operate four helicopter bases for the mca 
the mca has the option to extend our agreement through july we expect that the transition of work will take place  one base at a time  over a period of at least one year starting from july at the end of the agreement and any transition period  we expect that we will either be able to employ these aircraft for other customers  trade the aircraft in as partial consideration towards the purchase of new aircraft or sell the aircraft 
in fiscal years and  we had million and million  respectively  in operating revenues associated with this contract 
in july  we entered into a partnership with fbh and a third party  serco limited  through which we will seek to obtain the future uk wide search and rescue contract  including the provision of a significant number of aircraft  anticipated to start in west africa gross revenue for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity in nigeria from fiscal year resulting from the addition of three new contracts in fiscal year  an increase in rates under our contract with a major customer in nigeria beginning october   increases in certain of our standard monthly rates for other contracts  and a million increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers 
operating expense for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million in fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of higher salary expense and maintenance costs associated with the increase in activity  increases in freight charges on spare parts  higher travel and security costs  increased valve added tax expense and the increase in out of pocket expenses rebilled to our customers 
we are currently involved in negotiations with the unions in nigeria and anticipate that we will increase certain benefits for union personnel as a result of these negotiations 
we do not expect these benefit increases to have a material impact on our results of operations 
operating margin for west africa increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year as a result of the increase in gross revenue 
in april  we extended our contract with a major customer to march   under which we will provide and operate two large and two medium helicopters 
the contract is not cancelable by the customer during the first months and days cancellation notice is required in the second months 
in december  we reached an agreement with a major customer in nigeria to increase rates beginning october  in the second quarter of fiscal year  we commenced a reorganization of our nigerian operations  including increased security  consolidation of two former operating businesses  expansion of several hangar facilities  integration of finance and administrative functions  and repositioning of major maintenance operations into our two largest operating facilities 
this reorganization as well as periodic disruption to our operations related to civil unrest and violence have made and are expected to continue to make our operating results from nigeria unpredictable through at least the end of calendar year southeast asia gross revenue for southeast asia increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher revenue in australia 
australia s flight activity and revenue increased and  respectively  from fiscal year  primarily due to the utilization of an additional large aircraft  increases in certain rates and the billing of contract escalations 
operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year primarily as a result of an increase in salary  maintenance and fuel costs related to the increase in activity compared to fiscal year as a result of higher gross revenue during fiscal year  operating margin increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year we are currently involved in discussions with the pilot s union in australia  and we currently expect that the labor rates on our existing contracts could increase starting in fiscal year other international gross revenue for other international increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in flight activity in russia  the billing of escalation charges on contracts in both russia million in gross revenue and mauritania million in gross revenue  the commencement of flight operations in kenya  and additional revenue in egypt resulting from an additional large aircraft leased to our unconsolidated affiliate in that country  which commenced in december operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in operating expense is primarily due to increased operational costs associated with the increases in flight activity discussed above and increased general and administrative costs associated with higher salaries  travel expenses  and overhead cost allocations 
as a result of the increase in general and administrative costs discussed above  our operating margin for other international decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year eh centralized operations our eh centralized operations business unit is comprised of our technical services business  other non flight services business eg  provision of maintenance and supply chain parts and services to other eastern hemisphere business units in the eastern hemisphere and division level expenses for our eastern hemisphere businesses 
operating expense reflects costs associated with other non flight services net of the related charge to the other eastern hemisphere business units 
gross revenue for eh centralized operations increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a result of increased parts sales  increased intercompany charges to other business units for overhead costs and increased out of pocket costs rebilled to our customers in fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating expense decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to lower unrecovered maintenance costs  higher maintenance costs in fiscal year for a large aircraft that was being prepared for deployment to malaysia and lower professional fees incurred in fiscal year  partially offset by increased salaries for additional personnel and increased costs of materials 
in march  an unconsolidated affiliate of ours  fbh  was awarded a million extension to its contract to provide helicopters and support to british forces cyprus and the sovereign base areas administration until march  under the contract  fbh provides four highly modified civil owned military registered bell ep helicopters together with associated engineering and logistics support 
production management services gross revenue for our production management services segment decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  a decrease of  primarily due to the previously announced reduction of the scope of our services under a contract with a significant customer beginning in october  which was partially offset by labor revenue associated with the addition of several new contracts 
we also had additional billings to an existing customer beginning in june for an additional helicopter provided to them under contract 
operating expense decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to the decrease in costs associated with the reduction in work with a significant customer  which also resulted in a decrease in our operating margin to for fiscal year from in fiscal year as discussed above  in september  a significant customer of the production management services segment advised us that the scope of work under our services contract would be substantially reduced beginning in october this work represented and of our consolidated gross revenue for fiscal years and  respectively

excluding the tax recorded as a result of the turbo asset sale  our effective tax rate for fiscal year was 
during fiscal year  we benefited from the resolution of tax contingencies of million 
our effective tax rate was also reduced by the permanent reinvestment outside the us of foreign earnings  upon which no us tax has been provided  and by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
the significant variance between the us federal statutory rate and the effective rate for fiscal year was due primarily to the resolution of tax contingencies of million during that period  as a result of our evaluation of the need for such reserves in light of the expiration of the related statutes of limitations

capital commitments as shown in the table below  we expect to make additional capital expenditures over the next six fiscal years to purchase additional aircraft 
as of march   we had aircraft on order and options to acquire an additional aircraft

the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by uk legislation within three years and funded within years 
in may  the pensions regulator tpr in the uk published a statement on regulating the funding of defined benefit schemes 
in this statement  tpr focused on a number of items including the use of triggers to determine the level of funding of the schemes 
in order to meet our funding requirements  we will increase the contributions to the schemes to million million per year beginning in fiscal year nevertheless  regulatory agencies in the uk may require us to further increase the contributions 
tax payments during fiscal year  we expect to make additional payments for underreported payroll taxes in nigeria in the range of million to million  which were accrued in prior periods 
contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments  interest payments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the table below

the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of march  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report payments due by period fiscal year ending march  total and beyond in thousands contractual obligations long term debt and short term borrowings principal interest aircraft operating leases other operating leases pension obligations aircraft purchase obligations other purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments debt guarantees other guarantees letters of credit total other commercial commitments represents nine aircraft that we sold on december  for million in aggregate to a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation and then leased back under separate operating leases with terms of ten years expiring in january a deferred gain on the sale of the aircraft was recorded in the amount of approximately million in aggregate  which is being amortized over the lease term 
represents minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 
represents expected funding for pension benefits in future periods 
these amounts are undiscounted and are based on the expectation that the pension will be fully funded in approximately years 
as of december   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability associated with this obligation 
also  the timing of the funding is dependent on actuarial valuations and resulting negotiations with the plan trustees 
other purchase obligations primarily represent unfilled purchase orders for aircraft parts  commitments associated with upgrading facilities at our bases and amounts committed under a supply agreement see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs and million of the debt of rlr  both unconsolidated affiliates

in january  a letter of credit was issued against the revolving credit facility for million in conjunction with the additional collateral for the sale and leaseback financing discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the annual report 
the letter of credit expires january  we do not expect the guarantees shown in the table above to become obligations that we will have to fund 
financial condition and sources of liquidity our future cash requirements include the contractual obligations discussed in the previous section and our normal operations 
normally our operating cash flows are sufficient to fund our cash needs 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that our existing cash  future cash flows from operations and borrowing capacity under the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the foreseeable future based on existing commitments 
however  the expansion of our business through purchases of additional aircraft and increases in flight hours from our existing aircraft fleet may require additional cash in the future to fund new aircraft purchases and working capital requirements 
consistent with our desire to maintain a conservative use of leverage to fund growth  we raised capital through the sale of the preferred stock in september and october as of march   we had options to acquire an additional large aircraft and an additional medium aircraft 
depending on market conditions  we expect to exercise some or all of these additional options to acquire aircraft  purchase other aircraft or may elect to expand our business through acquisition  including acquisitions under consideration or negotiation 
these strategic decisions would require us to access additional sources of capital 
we currently expect to use debt financing 
see item a 
risk factors in order to grow our business  we may require additional capital in the future  which may not be available to us included elsewhere in this annual report 
cash and cash equivalents were million and million  as of march  and  respectively 
working capital as of march  and  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital during fiscal year was primarily a result of the million increase in cash and cash equivalents

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk below 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  professional advice and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oilfield service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market condition in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
the expenses reported for these taxes  including our annual tax provision  include the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal years  and  we had net reversals of reserves for estimated income tax exposures of million  million and million  respectively 
these reversals were made in the periods in which the statute of limitations for the related exposures expired 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  primarily us foreign tax credit carry forwards was million 
we decreased the valuation allowance as of march  to million 
if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are permanently reinvested of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
additionally  our management periodically makes strategic decisions related to our fleet that involve the possible removal of all or a substantial portion of specific aircraft types from our fleet  at which time these aircraft are reclassified to held for sale and subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
revenue recognition in general  we recognize revenue when it is both realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when the following conditions exist the persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally a customer contract  the services or products have been performed or delivered to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable within the contract  and collection is probable 
more specifically  revenue from helicopter services is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
the charges under these contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
these contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the contract before the end of the term 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than other helicopter contracts 
in order to offset potential increases in operating costs  our long term contracts may provide for periodic increases in the contractual rates charged for our services 
we recognize the impact of these rate increases when the criteria outlined above have been met 
this generally includes written recognition from our customers that they are in agreement with the amount of the rate escalation 
in addition  our standard rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are generally reimbursed by the customer 
revenue from production management is recognized based on contractual rates as the related services are performed 
contracts are generally evergreen with a yearly review 
each party has a thirty day cancellation clause 
the rates charged to the customer are either monthly  based on services specified in the contract  or hourly if outside the scope of the contract 
typically hourly rates are charged for services provided beyond the basic level contemplated in the contract 
services provided include personnel and transportation 
any escalation in rates is agreed to in writing by the customer 
with respect to both our helicopter services and production management services segments  cost reimbursements from customers are recorded as revenue 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
three of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the mortality rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
we base mortality rates utilized on actuarial research on these rates  which are adjusted to allow for expected mortality within our industry segment 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these reserves  we consider our historical experience  changes in our customer s financial position  restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with customers regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to international oil companies and government owned or government controlled oil companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
during fiscal years  and  we increased the allowance account through charges to expense of million  million and million  respectively  and decreased the allowance for write offs and recoveries of specifically identified uncollectible accounts by million  million and million  respectively 
additionally  during fiscal years and  we reduced revenue for reserves of million and million  respectively  against invoices billed to our unconsolidated affiliate in mexico  which have not been recognized in our results  and during fiscal year we recognized revenue and decreased our reserves for million collected from this affiliate  including million related to amounts billed in fiscal year see discussion in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
inventory reserve we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
parts related to aircraft types that our management has determined will no longer be included in our fleet or will be substantially reduced in our fleet in future periods are specifically reviewed 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
during fiscal years  and we increased the valuation reserve through charges to expenses of million  million and million  respectively  for excess and obsolete inventory 
during fiscal years  and  we decreased the valuation reserve for disposals and write offs of identified obsolete and excess inventory by million  million and million  respectively 
insurance we are self insured for our group medical insurance plans in the us in addition  we have several medical plans covering certain non us employee groups 
we must make estimates to record the expenses related to these plans 
we also have workers compensation programs in the us for work related injuries 
in addition  we have insurance for work related injuries covering certain non us employee groups 
we estimate the expenses related to the retained portion of that risk 
if actual experience under any of our insurance plans is greater than our original estimates  we may have to record charges to income when we identify the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if actual costs are lower than our estimates or return premiums are larger than originally projected  we may have to record credits to income 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
income for each reporting period includes revisions to contingent liability reserves resulting from different facts or information which becomes known or circumstances which change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
such revisions are based on information which becomes known after the reporting date for the previous period through the reporting date of the current period 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required to be recognized 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected flight hours and rates 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 
in addition to the annual review  we also test for impairment should an event occur or circumstances change that may indicate a reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
stock based compensation we have historically compensated our executives and employees through the awarding of stock based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units 
based on the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  which we adopted on april   we have begun to account for stock based compensation awards in fiscal year using a fair value based method  resulting in compensation expense for stock option awards being recorded in our condensed consolidated statements of income 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards under sfas no 
r  which is the same valuation technique we previously used for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including the risk free interest rate  volatility  dividend yield and the expected term of the options  in order to determine the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
additionally  the service period over which compensation expense associated with awards of restricted stock units are recorded in our statements of income involve certain assumptions as to the expected vesting of the restricted stock units  which is based on factors relating to the future performance of our stock 
as the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options and the service period for restricted stock units are critical estimates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the option 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of shares of our common stock  which has not been adjusted for any expectation of future volatility given uncertainty related to the future performance of our common stock at this time 
we also use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options within the option pricing model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
for a detail of the assumptions used for fiscal year  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal year and was adopted in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our net income or comprehensive income 
the primary impact is the reflection of a net accrued pension liability million as of march  versus the prior presentation of showing the prepaid pension costs separately from the accrued pension liabilities 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements will be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy ie  levels   and  as defined 
companies are required to provide enhanced disclosure regarding fair value measurements in the level category recurring fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs  including a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances separately for each major category of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal year and interim periods therein 
we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact of sfas no 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
provides guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year financial statement misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
prior practice allowed the evaluation of materiality on the basis of either the error quantified as the amount by which the current year income statement was misstated rollover method or the error quantified as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet was misstated iron curtain method 
reliance on either method in prior years could have resulted in misstatement of the financial statements 
sab no 
requires both methods to be used in evaluating materiality 
immaterial prior year errors may be corrected with the first filing of prior year financial statements after adoption 
the cumulative effect of the correction would be reflected in the opening balance sheet with appropriate disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error corrected in the cumulative adjustment  as well as a disclosure of the cause of the error and that the error had been deemed to be immaterial in the past 
sab no 
is effective for fiscal year and was adopted in the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
the adoption of this bulletin had no impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in september  the fasb approved fasb staff position aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities  which prohibits the accruing as a liability the future costs of periodic major overhauls and maintenance of plant and equipment 
other previously acceptable methods of accounting for planned major overhauls and maintenance continue to be permitted 
the new requirements apply to our fiscal year and must be retrospectively applied 
the adoption of this staff position will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position upon adoption 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin no 
requires enterprises to evaluate tax positions using a two step process consisting of recognition and measurement 
the effects of a tax position will be recognized in the period in which the enterprise determines that it is more likely than not defined as a more than likelihood that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being recognized upon ultimate settlement 
fin no 
is effective for our fiscal year we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact that the adoption of this interpretation will have on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion and disclosure made in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r on april  internal review and governmental investigations internal review in february  we voluntarily advised the staff of the sec that the audit committee of our board of directors had engaged special outside counsel to undertake a review of certain payments made by two of our affiliated entities in a foreign country 
the review of these payments  which initially focused on foreign corrupt practices act matters  was subsequently expanded by such special outside counsel to cover operations in other countries and other issues 
in connection with this review  special outside counsel to the audit committee retained forensic accountants 
as a result of the findings of the internal review which was completed in late  our quarter ended december  and prior financial statements were restated 
we also provided the sec with documentation resulting from the internal review  which eventually resulted in a formal sec investigation 
for further information on the restatements  see our fiscal year annual report 
for additional discussion of the sec investigation  the internal review  and related proceedings  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have communicated the audit committee s conclusions with respect to the findings of the internal review to regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which the relevant activities took place where appropriate 
until final resolution of all of these issues  such disclosure may result in legal and administrative proceedings  the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us and or current or former employees  officers and or directors who are within the jurisdictions of such authorities  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  including precluding us from participating in business operations in their countries 
to the extent that violations of the law may have occurred in countries in which we operate  related proceedings could also result in sanctions requiring us to curtail our business operations in one or more such countries for a period of time and affect or limit our ability to export our aircraft from such countries 
although we recorded an accrual of million for the expected outcome  we cannot predict the ultimate outcome of the sec investigation  nor can we predict whether other applicable us and foreign governmental authorities will initiate separate investigations 
the outcome of the sec investigation and any related legal and administrative proceedings could include the institution of administrative  civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us and or current or former employees  officers and or directors  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  modifications to business practices and compliance programs and or referral to other governmental agencies for other appropriate actions 
it is not possible to accurately predict at this time when matters relating to the sec investigation will be completed  the final outcome of the sec investigation  what if any actions may be taken by the sec or by other governmental agencies in the us or in foreign jurisdictions  or the effect that such actions may have on our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the disclosure and remediation of a number of activities identified in the internal review  we may encounter difficulties conducting business in certain foreign countries and retaining and attracting additional business with certain customers 
we cannot predict the extent of these difficulties  however  our ability to continue conducting business in these countries and with these customers and through agents may be significantly impacted 
it is also possible that we may become subject to claims by third parties  possibly resulting in litigation 
the matters identified in the internal review and their effects could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as we continue to respond to the sec investigation and other governmental authorities and take other actions relating to improper activities that have been identified in connection with the internal review  there can be no assurance that restatements  in addition to those reflected in our fiscal year annual report  will not be required or that our historical financial statements included in this annual report will not change or require further amendment 
in addition  as we continue to operate our compliance program  other situations involving foreign operations  similar to those matters disclosed to the sec in february and described above  could arise that warrant further investigation and subsequent disclosures 
as a result  new issues may be identified that may impact our financial statements and the scope of the restatements described above and lead us to take other remedial actions or otherwise adversely impact us 
during fiscal years  and  we incurred approximately million  million and million  respectively  in legal and other professional costs in connection with the internal review 
document subpoena from us department of justice in june  one of our subsidiaries received a document subpoena from the doj 
the subpoena related to a grand jury investigation of potential antitrust violations among providers of helicopter transportation services in the us gulf of mexico 
the subpoena focused on activities during the period from january  to june  we believe we have submitted to the doj substantially all documents responsive to the subpoena 
we have had discussions with the doj and provided documents related to our operations in the us as well as internationally 
we intend to continue to provide additional information as required by the doj in connection with the investigation 
there is no assurance that  after review of any information furnished by us or by third parties  the doj will not ultimately conclude that violations of us antitrust laws have occurred 
the period of time necessary to resolve the doj investigation is uncertain  and this matter could require significant management and financial resources that could otherwise be devoted to the operation of our business 
the outcome of the doj investigation and any related legal proceedings in other countries could include civil injunctive or criminal proceedings involving us or our current or former officers  directors or employees  the imposition of fines and other penalties  remedies and or sanctions  including potential disbarments  and referrals to other governmental agencies 
in addition  in cases where anti competitive conduct is found by the government  there is a greater likelihood for civil litigation to be brought by third parties seeking recovery 
any such civil litigation could have serious consequences for our company  including the costs of the litigation and potential orders to pay restitution or other damages or penalties  including potentially treble damages  to any parties that were determined to be injured as a result of any impermissible anti competitive conduct 
any of these adverse consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the doj investigation  any related proceedings in other countries and any third party litigation  as well as any negative outcome that may result from the investigation  proceedings or litigation  could also negatively impact our relationships with customers and our ability to generate revenue 
in connection with this matter  we incurred million and million in legal and other professional fees in fiscal years and  respectively  and significant expenditures may continue to be incurred in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we may be exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk  and interest rates as discussed below 
foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are in british pounds sterling 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 
because we maintain our financial statements in us dollars  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar and between other foreign currencies and the us dollar 
in preparing our financial statements  we must convert all non us dollar currencies to non us dollars 
the effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in a component of stockholders investment and foreign currency transaction gains or losses and translation of currency amounts not deemed permanently reinvested are credited or charged to income and reflected in other income expense 
in the past three fiscal years our stockholders investment has increased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
the british pound sterling is the currency in which most of bristow aviation s revenue and expenses are paid 
approximately of our gross revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pounds sterling into us dollars 
in addition  we receive other revenue that is not in us dollars or british pounds sterling  such as australian dollars  euros  nigerian naira  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from the effect of changes in exchange rates on transactions denominated in currencies other than a company s functional currency  including transactions between consolidated companies 
an exception is made where an intercompany loan or advance is deemed to be of a long term investment nature  in which instance the foreign currency transaction gains and losses are included with cumulative translation gains and losses and are reported in stockholders investment as accumulated other comprehensive gains or losses 
balance sheet information is presented based on the exchange rate as of the balance sheet date  and income statement information is presented based on the average conversion rate for the period 
the various components of equity are presented at their historical average exchange rates 
the resulting difference after applying the different exchange rates is the cumulative translation adjustment 
as a result of the changes in exchange rates during fiscal years and  we recorded foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily related to the british pound sterling  compared to foreign currency transaction gains of approximately million during fiscal year these gains and losses arose primarily from the following us dollar denominated transactions entered into by bristow aviation whose functional currency is the british pound sterling cash and cash equivalents held in us dollar denominated accounts 
beginning in july  we reduced a portion of bristow aviation s us dollar denominated cash balances 
us dollar denominated intercompany loans and us dollar denominated receivables 
on august   we entered into a derivative contract to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
this derivative contract provided us with a call option on million and a put option on million  with a strike price of us dollars per british pound sterling  and was exercised by us prior to the scheduled expiration on november   resulting in a net loss of million 
on november   we entered into another derivative contract for the same amount and strike price that expired on may  the fair value of this contract  which totaled million as of march   is recorded as a derivative asset within other assets on our balance sheet 
the change in fair value of this contract from november  to march  resulted in a gain of million  which served to offset a portion of the foreign currency transaction losses recorded during fiscal year this contract expired on may   resulting in a cumulative gain of million  of which million related to the period subsequent to march  on april   primarily as a result of changes in the manner in which certain of our consolidated subsidiaries create and manage intercompany balances  we changed the functional currency of two of our consolidated subsidiaries  bristow helicopters international ltd 
and caledonia helicopters ltd  from the british pound sterling to the us dollar 
as a result of this change  our exposure to us dollar denominated intercompany loans and advances across our organization has been significantly reduced 
euro and nigerian naira denominated intercompany loans 
the economic effect of the foreign currency transaction losses during fiscal year was offset by a corresponding benefit during those periods reflected as a cumulative translation adjustment in stockholders investment on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  in april we significantly reduced our euro denominated intercompany loans  thereby reducing our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates for this foreign currency 
we are evaluating alternatives to further mitigate these remaining foreign currency exchange exposures 
the following table presents the applicable exchange rates of one british pound sterling into us dollars for the indicated periods fiscal year ended march  high average low as of march   and the exchange rate was  and  respectively 
we occasionally use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage risks associated with our operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  we will use forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
we have historically used these instruments primarily in the buying and selling of spare parts  maintenance services and equipment 
as of march   we did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding 
as discussed above  we had a derivative contract outstanding as of march   which served to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our us dollar denominated intercompany loans 
a hypothetical decrease in the value of the foreign currencies in which our business is denominated relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk the market for our services and products is primarily the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated international oil companies and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments in minimal 
interest rate risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  none of which carries a variable rate of interest 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates
