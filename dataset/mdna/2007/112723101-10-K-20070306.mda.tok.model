item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read along with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion includes forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance and that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results  performance or achievements could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and item a risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  construct and market single family and multi family homes primarily to move up and luxury homebuyers and develop land for sale to other homebuilders 
we operate in the following geographic regions which are presented as our reportable segments northern california san francisco bay area and sacramento  southland los angeles  san diego riverside and washington dc area 
our other operations that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate disclosure are included in corporate and other 
our goal is to maximize the total return on our common stockholders equity over the long term 
we plan to achieve this by actively managing our assets and creating value on the lots we own or control 
the  lots that we control   of which we own directly or through joint ventures  provide a strong foundation for our future homebuilding business and visibility on our future cash flow and earnings 
we believe we add value to the lots we control through entitlements  development and the construction of homes 
in allocating capital to our operations we generally limit our risk on unentitled land through optioning such land positions in all our markets thereby mitigating our capital at risk 
option contracts for the purchase of land permits us to control lots for an extended period of time 
we have controlled our  lots since the following specified years total year of lots owned optioned controlled lots pre the united states housing industry experienced an industry wide softening of demand  mainly due to a significant negative shift in homebuyer sentiment that continued through we believe this shift in sentiment was a result of a number of factors  including the impact of higher home prices on consumer confidence and increases in short term interest rates 
in addition  as price appreciation slowed  the impact of investors and speculators on the markets became more evident  particularly for us in san diego and the washington dc area 
the resulting impact of these buyers canceling their sales contracts or listing their investment homes for sale was a substantial increase in new and resale home inventories 
these market conditions negatively impacted our operations resulting in lower home sales per community  an increase in home cancellation rates  increases in homebuyer incentives and a decrease in lots sold to other builders 
homebuilding is our primary source of revenue and has represented approximately of our total revenue since our operations are positioned to close up to  homes annually 
operating in markets with higher price points and catering to move up and luxury buyers  our average sales price in of  was well in excess of the national average sales price 
we also sell serviced and unserviced lots to other homebuilders  generally on an opportunistic basis where we can redeploy capital to an asset providing higher returns or reduce risk in a market 
in  we sold lots  the majority of which were bulk sales of raw or undeveloped land in our southland and san diego operations 
in addition to our housing and land inventory and investments in housing and land joint ventures  which together comprised of our total assets as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in other assets 
other assets consist of homebuyer receivables of million  deferred income taxes of million  and mortgages and other receivables of million 
homebuyer receivables consist primarily of proceeds due from homebuyers on the closing of homes 
since  we have generated over million in operating cash flow that was used mainly to return cash to stockholders through the repurchase of shares and the payment of dividends 
at the same time  despite the current slowdown in the united states housing market  we believe our business is positioned to create further shareholder value through the selective control of a significant number of strategic projects and the overall level of lots controlled 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements of our company  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our most critical accounting policies are those that we believe are the most important in portraying our financial condition and results of operations  and require the most subjectivity and estimates by our management 
a summary of our significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  is provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our company included elsewhere in this form k 
carrying values the housing and land inventory that we own directly and through joint ventures is reviewed for recoverability on a regular basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
to arrive at this amount  we estimate the cash flow for the life of each project 
these projections take into account the specific business plans for each project  and our estimate of the most probable set of economic conditions anticipated to prevail in the market area 
if these assets are considered to be impaired  they are then written down to the fair value less estimated selling costs 
the ultimate fair values for our housing and land inventory are dependent upon future market and economic conditions 
if our estimate of future cash flows is significantly different from our actual cash flows  we may prematurely impair the value of the asset  we may underestimate the value of the calculated impairment or we may fail to record an impairment 
in these cases  our housing and land inventory would be represented on our balance sheet at other than its cost or fair value  which could have an effect on our gross margin in future periods as we develop and sell the assets 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of impairment charges related to housing and land we directly own which is included in our direct cost of sales 
the million in impairment charges are related to finished lots acquired in in addition  we wrote off million  primarily related to lot options on unentitled land that expired 
capitalized costs our housing and land inventory on our consolidated balance sheet includes the costs of acquiring land  development and construction costs  interest  property taxes and overhead directly related to the development of the land and housing 
direct costs are capitalized to individual homes and lots and other costs are allocated to each lot in proportion to our anticipated revenue 
estimates of costs to complete homes and lots sold are recorded at the time of closing 
these estimates are prepared on an individual home and lot basis and take into account the specific cost components of each individual home and lot 
the estimation process to allocate costs to homes and lots is dependent on project budgets that are based on various assumptions  including construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
these estimates are reviewed for accuracy based on actual payments made after closing and adjustments are made if necessary 
if the estimates of costs are significantly different from our actual results  our housing and land inventory may be over or under stated on our balance sheet  and accordingly gross margins in a particular period may be over or under stated 
revenue recognition revenues from the sale of homes are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  wherein all proceeds are received or collectability is evident 
land sales are recognized when title passes to the purchaser upon closing  all material conditions of the sales contract have been met and a significant cash down payment or appropriate security is received  and collectability is evident

cash flows for each of our communities depend upon the applicable stage of the development cycle and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  site approvals and entitlements  construction of model homes  roads  certain utilities and other amenities and general landscaping 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during such early stages may significantly exceed cash flows 
later  cash flows can significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales include charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs

deferred tax our company was formed in the course of a reorganization in by brookfield properties of its united states homebuilding operations and was withdrawn from the brookfield properties consolidated tax group 
the tax provisions that apply in connection with the reorganization  including the departure of a member from a consolidated group  are detailed and complex and are therefore subject to uncertainty 
our accounts payable and other liabilities include million related to the uncertainties in tax attributes which were recorded when we left the brookfield properties consolidated tax group with million of net operating losses 
in addition  if any member of the consolidated group were reassessed for taxation years prior to  this could have a direct impact on the net operating losses available to the company on the spin off 
there is also a million liability included in accounts payable and other liabilities and a million valuation allowance in deferred taxes that relates to the tax cost of properties in excess of the fair value of properties at the time of reorganization of the company which may not be realized 
the exact amount of these tax liabilities will be determined at the earlier of a review of the spin off transaction by taxation authorities or a further liability of million has been recorded in respect of tax positions taken

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company s fiscal year beginning january   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently reviewing the impact of this statement on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with fasb  accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently reviewing the effect of this interpretation on our consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly information we have historically experienced variability in results of operations from quarter to quarter due to the seasonal nature of the homebuilding business and the timing of new community openings and the closing out of projects 
we typically experience the highest rate of orders for new homes in the first six months of the calendar year 
new home deliveries trail new home orders by several months  therefore we normally have a greater percentage of new home deliveries in the second half of our fiscal year 
as a result  our revenues from deliveries of homes are generally higher in the second half of the year

therefore  the sum of per share amounts for the quarters may not agree with per share amounts for the year
