item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollars in thousands  except per share amounts overview we are a holding company for a number of businesses 
we are engaged principally in the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the united states through our subsidiary liggett group inc  the development and marketing of the low nicotine and nicotine free quest cigarette products and the development of reduced risk cigarette products through our subsidiary vector tobacco inc  and the real estate business through our subsidiary  new valley llc  which is seeking to acquire additional operating companies and real estate properties 
new valley owns of douglas elliman realty  llc  which operates the largest residential brokerage company in the new york metropolitan area 
in recent years  we have undertaken a number of initiatives to streamline the cost structure of our tobacco business and improve operating efficiency and long term earnings 
during  the sales and marketing functions  along with certain support functions  of our liggett and vector tobacco subsidiaries were combined into a new entity  liggett vector brands inc this company coordinates and executes the sales and marketing efforts for our tobacco operations 
effective year end  we closed vector tobacco s timberlake  north carolina cigarette manufacturing facility in order to reduce excess cigarette production capacity and improve operating efficiencies company wide 
production of quest and vector tobacco s other cigarette brands was transferred to liggett s manufacturing facility in mebane  north carolina 
in july  we completed the sale of the timberlake facility and equipment 
in april  we eliminated a number of positions in our tobacco operations and subleased excess office space 
in october  we announced a plan to restructure the operations of liggett vector brands 
liggett vector brands has realigned its sales force and adjusted its business model to more efficiently serve its chain and independent customers nationwide 
in connection with the restructuring  we eliminated approximately full time positions and part time positions as of december  we may consider various additional opportunities to further improve efficiencies and reduce costs 
these prior and current initiatives have involved material restructuring and impairment charges  and any further actions taken are likely to involve material charges as well 
although management may estimate that substantial cost savings will be associated with these restructuring actions  there is a risk that these actions could have a serious negative impact on our tobacco operations and that any estimated increases in profitability cannot be achieved 
in december  we completed an exchange offer and a subsequent short form merger whereby we acquired the remaining of the common shares of new valley that we did not already own 
as a result of these transactions  new valley became our wholly owned subsidiary and each outstanding new valley common share was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
a total of approximately million of our common shares were issued to the new valley shareholders in the transactions 
all of liggett s unit sales volume in and was in the discount segment  which liggett s management believes has been the primary growth segment in the industry for over a decade 
the significant discounting of premium cigarettes in recent years has led to brands  such as eve  that were traditionally considered premium brands to become more appropriately categorized as discount  following list price reductions 
effective february   liggett reduced the eve list price from the premium price level to the branded discount level 

table of contents liggett s cigarettes are produced in approximately combinations of length  style and packaging 
liggett s current brand portfolio includes liggett select the third largest brand in the deep discount category  grand prix a rapidly growing brand in the deep discount segment  eve a leading brand of millimeter cigarettes in the branded discount category  pyramid the industry s first deep discount product with a brand identity  and usa and various partner brands and private label brands 
in  liggett introduced liggett select  one of the leading brands in the deep discount category 
liggett select is now the largest seller in liggett s family of brands  comprising of liggett s unit volume in  in and in in september  liggett repositioned grand prix to distributors and retailers nationwide 
grand prix is marketed as the lowest price fighter to specifically compete with brands which are priced at the lowest level of the deep discount segment 
under the master settlement agreement reached in november with states and various territories  the three largest cigarette manufacturers must make settlement payments to the states and territories based on how many cigarettes they sell annually 
liggett  however  is not required to make any payments unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us cigarette market 
additionally  as a result of the medallion acquisition  vector tobacco likewise has no payment obligation unless its market share exceeds approximately of the us market 
we believe that liggett has gained a sustainable cost advantage over its competitors as a result of the settlement 
the discount segment is highly competitive  with consumers having less brand loyalty and placing greater emphasis on price 
while the three major manufacturers all compete with liggett in the discount segment of the market  the strongest competition for market share has recently come from a group of small manufacturers and importers  most of which sell low quality  deep discount cigarettes 
in january  vector tobacco introduced quest  its brand of low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products 
quest is designed for adult smokers who are interested in reducing their levels of nicotine intake and is currently available in both menthol and non menthol styles 
each quest style regular and menthol offers three different packagings  with decreasing amounts of nicotine quest  and quest  the low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the extra low nicotine variety  contains milligrams of nicotine 
quest  the nicotine free variety  contains only trace levels of nicotine no more than milligrams of nicotine per cigarette 
quest cigarettes utilize proprietary processes and materials that enables the production of cigarettes with nicotine free tobacco that tastes and smokes like tobacco in conventional cigarettes 
all six quest varieties are being sold in box style packs and are priced comparably to other premium brands 
quest is primarily available in new york  new jersey  pennsylvania  ohio  indiana  illinois  michigan and arizona 
these eight states account for approximately of all cigarette sales in the united states 
the brand is supported by point of purchase awareness campaigns 
during the second quarter  we recognized a non cash charge of  to adjust the carrying value of excess leaf tobacco inventory for the quest product  based on estimates of future demand and market conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash charge of to adjust the carrying value of excess leaf inventory for the quest product 
quest brand cigarettes are currently marketed solely to permit adult smokers  who wish to continue smoking  to gradually reduce their intake of nicotine 
the products are not labeled or advertised for smoking cessation or as a safer form of smoking 
in october  we announced that jed e 
rose  phd  director of duke university medical center s nicotine research program and co inventor of the nicotine patch  had conducted a study at duke university medical center to provide preliminary evaluation of the use of the quest technology as a smoking cessation 
table of contents aid 
in the preliminary study on quest  of quest smokers were able to achieve four week continuous abstinence 
in march  vector tobacco concluded a randomized  multi center phase ii clinical trial to further evaluate quest technology as an effective alternative to conventional smoking cessation aids 
in july  we participated in an end of phase ii meeting with the food and drug administration fda where we received significant guidance and feedback from the agency with regard to further development of the quest technology 
in november  our board of directors determined to discontinue the genetics operation of our subsidiary  vector research ltd  and  not to pursue  at this time  fda approval of quest as a smoking cessation aid  due to the projected significant additional time and expense involved in seeking such approval 
in connection with this decision  we eliminated full time positions effective december  in addition  we terminated certain license agreements associated with the genetics operations 
notwithstanding the foregoing  vector tobacco is continuing its dialogue with the fda with respect to the prospects for phase iii trials 
vector tobacco will continue to evaluate whether to proceed with phase iii trials 
as a result of these actions  we currently expect to realize annual cost savings in excess of  beginning in we recognized pre tax restructuring and inventory impairment charges of approximately  primarily during the fourth quarter of the restructuring charges include approximately relating to employee severance and benefit costs  for contract termination and other associated costs  approximately for asset impairment and in inventory write offs 
approximately  of these charges represent non cash items 
recent developments issuance of new convertible debentures 
in july  we sold  principal amount of our variable interest senior convertible debentures due june  in a private offering to qualified institutional investors in accordance with rule a under the securities act 
we used the net proceeds of the offering to redeem our remaining convertible subordinated notes due july  and for general corporate purposes

phillip frost and an investment entity affiliated with carl c 
icahn converted a total of  principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes due into  shares of our common stock in accordance with the terms of the notes 
in connection with the conversion of the notes  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock to these holders and paid these holders  of accrued interest 
the additional shares and accrued interest were issued and paid as an inducement to these holders to convert the notes 
we recognized a non cash expense of  in connection with these transactions in the second quarter of tax settlement 
on july   we entered into a settlement with the internal revenue service with respect to the philip morris brand transaction where a subsidiary of liggett contributed three of its premium cigarette brands to trademarks llc  a newly formed limited liability company 
in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest for a day period commencing in march the company deferred  for income tax purposes  a portion of the gain on the transaction until such time as the options were exercised 
in connection with an examination of our and federal income tax returns  the internal revenue service issued to us in september a notice of proposed adjustment 
the notice asserted that  for tax reporting purposes  the entire gain should have been recognized in and in the additional amounts of  and  respectively  rather than upon the exercise of the options during either of the day periods commencing in december or in march as part of the settlement  we agreed that  of our gain on the transaction would be recognized by us as income for tax purposes in and that the balance of the remaining gain  net of previously capitalized expenses of   will be recognized by us as income in or upon 
table of contents exercise of the options 
we paid during the third and fourth quarters of approximately  including interest  with respect to the gain recognized in as a result of the settlement  we reduced  during the third quarter of  the excess portion  of a previously established reserve in our consolidated financial statements  which resulted in a decrease in such amount in reported tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
new valley exchange offer 
in december  we completed an exchange offer and subsequent short form merger whereby we acquired the remaining of the common shares of new valley corporation that we did not already own 
as result of these transactions  new valley corporation became our wholly owned subsidiary and each outstanding new valley corporation common share was exchanged for shares of our common stock 
a total of approximately million of our common shares were issued to the new valley corporation shareholders in the transactions 
the surviving corporation in the short form merger was subsequently merged into a new delaware limited liability company named new valley llc  which conducts the business of the former new valley corporation 
prior to these transactions  new valley corporation was registered under the securities exchange act of and filed periodic reports and other information with the sec 
tobacco settlement agreements 
in october  the independent auditor notified liggett and all other participating manufacturers that their payment obligations under the master settlement agreement  dating from the agreement s execution in late  were going to be recalculated utilizing net unit amounts  rather than gross unit amounts which have been utilized since 
the change in the method of calculation could  among other things  require additional payments by liggett under the master settlement agreement of approximately  for the periods through  and require liggett to pay an additional amount of approximately  in and in future periods by lowering liggett s market share exemption under the master settlement agreement 
liggett has objected to this retroactive change and has disputed the change in methodology 
no amounts have been accrued in our consolidated financial statements for any potential liability relating to the gross versus net dispute 
in  the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement calculated that liggett owed  for its sales 
in april  liggett paid  and disputed the balance  as permitted by the master settlement agreement 
liggett subsequently paid an additional  of the disputed amount although liggett continues to dispute that this amount is owed 
this  relates to an adjustment to its payment obligation claimed by liggett for the market share loss to non participating manufacturers  which is known as the npm adjustment 
at december   included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheet was a receivable of  relating to such amount 
the remaining balance in dispute of  which has been withheld from payment  is comprised of  claimed for a npm adjustment and  relating to the independent auditor s retroactive change from gross to net units in calculating master settlement agreement payments  which liggett contends is improper  as discussed above 
from its april payment  liggett withheld approximately  claimed for the npm adjustment and  relating to the retroactive change from gross to net units 
the following amounts have not been accrued in our consolidated financial statements as they relate to liggett s claims for npm adjustments  for   for and for in march  an independent economic consulting firm selected pursuant to the master settlement agreement rendered its final and non appealable decision that the master settlement agreement was a significant factor contributing to the loss of market share of participating manufacturers for in february  this firm rendered the same decision with respect to as a result  the manufacturers are entitled to potential npm adjustments to their and master settlement agreement payments 
a settling state that has diligently enforced its qualifying escrow statute in the year in question may be able to avoid application of the npm adjustment to the payments made by the manufacturers for the benefit of that state or territory 
since april  notwithstanding provisions in the master settlement agreement requiring arbitration  litigation has been commenced in settling states over the issue of whether the application of the npm adjustment for is to be determined through litigation or arbitration 
these actions relate to the potential 
table of contents npm adjustment for  which the independent auditor under the master settlement agreement previously determined to be as much as  to date  of courts that have decided the issue have ruled that the npm adjustment dispute is arbitrable 
many of the decisions compelling arbitration have been appealed 
the participating manufacturers have appealed the decision of the north dakota court that the dispute is not arbitrable 
there can be no assurance that the participating manufacturers will receive any adjustment as a result of these proceedings 
in  in order to resolve any potential issues with minnesota as to liggett s settlement obligations  liggett negotiated a a year payment to minnesota  to be paid any year cigarettes manufactured by liggett are sold in that state 
in  the attorneys general for each of florida  mississippi and texas advised liggett that they believed that liggett has failed to make all required payments under the respective settlement agreements with these states for the period through and that additional payments may be due for and subsequent years 
liggett believes these allegations are without merit  based  among other things  on the language of the most favored nation provisions of the settlement agreements 
in december  florida offered to settle all amounts allegedly owed by liggett for the period through for the sum of  in march  florida reaffirmed its december offer to settle and provided liggett with a day notice to cure the alleged defaults 
liggett offered florida  in a lump sum to settle all alleged obligations through december  and per year thereafter in any year in which cigarettes manufactured by liggett are sold in florida  to resolve all alleged future obligations under the settlement agreement

no specific monetary demand has been made by texas 
liggett has met with representatives of mississippi and texas to discuss the issues relating to the alleged defaults  although no resolution has been reached 
except for  accrued for the year ended december  and an additional accrued during  in connection with the foregoing matters  no other amounts have been accrued in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for any additional amounts that may be payable by liggett under the settlement agreements with florida  mississippi and texas

recent developments in legislation  regulation and tobacco related litigation the cigarette industry continues to be challenged on numerous fronts 
new cases continue to be commenced against liggett and other cigarette manufacturers 
as of december   there were approximately individual suits excluding approximately individual smoker cases pending in west virginia state court as a consolidated action  liggett has been severed from the trial of the consolidated action  purported class actions and nine governmental and other third party payor health care reimbursement actions pending in the united states in which liggett was a named defendant 
a civil lawsuit was filed by the united states federal government seeking disgorgement of approximately  from various cigarette manufacturers  including liggett 
in august  the trial court entered a final judgment and remedial order against each of the cigarette manufacturing defendants  except liggett 
the final judgment  among other things  ordered the following relief against the non liggett defendants i the defendants are enjoined from committing any act of racketeering concerning the manufacturing  marketing  promotion  health consequences or sale of cigarettes in the united states  ii the defendants are enjoined from making any material false  misleading  or deceptive statement or representation concerning cigarettes that persuades people to purchase cigarettes  iii the defendants are permanently enjoined from utilizing lights  low tar  ultra lights  mild  or natural descriptors  or conveying any other express or implied health messages in connection with the marketing or sale of cigarettes as of january   iv the defendants must make corrective statements on their websites  and in television and print media advertisements  v the defendants must maintain internet document websites until with access to smoking and health related documents  vi the defendants must disclose all disaggregated marketing data to the government on a confidential basis  vii the defendants are not permitted to sell or otherwise transfer any of their cigarette brands  product formulas or businesses to any person or entity for domestic use without a court order  and unless the acquiring person or entity will be bound by the terms of the final judgment  and viii the defendants must pay the appropriate costs of the government in prosecuting the action  in an amount to be determined by the trial court 
it is unclear what impact  if any  the final judgment will have on the cigarette industry as a whole 
while liggett was excluded from the final judgment  to the extent that it leads to a decline in industry wide shipments of cigarettes in the united states  liggett s sales volume  operating income and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
class action suits have been filed in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers  alleging  among other things  that the use of the terms light and ultralight constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices 
one such suit schwab v 
philip morris  pending in federal court in new york against the cigarette manufacturers  seeks to create a nationwide class of light cigarette smokers and includes liggett as a defendant 
the action asserts claims under the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act rico 
the proposed class is seeking as much as  in damages  which could be trebled under rico 
in november  the court ruled that if the class is certified  the plaintiffs would be permitted to calculate damages on an aggregate basis and use fluid recovery theories to allocate them among class members 
fluid recovery would permit potential damages to be paid out in ways other than merely giving cash directly to plaintiffs  such as establishing a pool of money that could be used for public purposes 
on september   the court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification 
on november   the united states court of appeals for the second circuit issued a permanent stay of the case  pending appeal 
there are currently four individual tobacco related actions pending where liggett is the only tobacco company defendant 
in april  in one of these cases  a jury in a florida state court action awarded compensatory damages of against liggett 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of liggett has appealed both the verdict and the award of legal fees 
in march  in another case in florida state court in which liggett is the only defendant  the court granted liggett s motion for summary judgment 
the plaintiff appealed and  in june  a florida intermediate appellate court reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the case back to the trial court 
trial has been scheduled in missouri state court for may in another case 

table of contents in may  florida s third district court of appeal reversed a  punitive damages award against liggett and decertified the engle smoking and health class action 
in july  the florida supreme court affirmed in part and reversed in part the may intermediate appellate court decision 
among other things  the florida supreme court affirmed the decision decertifying the class and the order vacating the punitive damages award  but preserved several of the trial court s phase i findings including that i smoking causes lung cancer  among other diseases  ii nicotine in cigarettes is addictive  iii defendants placed cigarettes on the market that were defective and unreasonably dangerous  iv the defendants concealed material information  v the defendants agreed to misrepresent information relating to the health effects of cigarettes with the intention that the public would rely on this information to its detriment  vi all defendants sold or supplied cigarettes that were defective  and vii all defendants were negligent and allowed plaintiffs to proceed to trial on individual liability issues utilizing the above findings and compensatory and punitive damage issues  provided they commence their individual lawsuits within one year of the date the court s decision became final on january  all parties moved for reconsideration and or clarification 
in december  the florida supreme court denied the motions  except that the court vacated the determination of a finding as to fraud and misrepresentation by defendants  and  therefore  the conspiracy to misrepresent finding was also vacated 
the florida supreme court issued its mandate on that decision on january  the decision could result in the filing of a large number of individual personal injury cases in florida which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in june  the jury in lukacs v 
r 
j 
reynolds tobacco company  an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case  awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
the plaintiff has recently moved for the trial court to enter final judgment in this matter and to tax costs and attorneys fees 
liggett may be required to bond the amount of the judgment against it to perfect its appeal 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
we cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
in recent years  there have been a number of proposed restrictive regulatory actions from various federal administrative bodies  including the united states environmental protection agency and the fda 
there have also been adverse political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry  including the commencement and certification of class actions and the commencement of third party payor actions 
recently  legislation was reintroduced in congress providing for the regulation of cigarettes by the fda 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
we are not able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation  but our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any tobacco related litigation 
critical accounting policies general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
significant estimates subject to material changes in the near term include restructuring and impairment charges  inventory valuation  deferred tax assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  promotional accruals  sales returns and allowances  actuarial assumptions of pension plans  embedded derivative liability  the tobacco quota buyout  settlement accruals and litigation and defense costs 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
during the fourth quarter of  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
revenues from sales of cigarettes are recognized upon the shipment of finished goods when title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sale price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we provide an allowance for expected sales returns  net of any related inventory cost recoveries 
in accordance with the eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes should be presented in the income statement gross versus net  our accounting policy is to include federal excise taxes in revenues and cost of goods sold 
such revenues and cost of sales totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
since our primary line of business is tobacco  our financial position and our results of operations and cash flows have been and could continue to be materially adversely affected by significant unit sales volume declines  litigation and defense costs  increased tobacco costs or reductions in the selling price of cigarettes in the near term 
marketing costs 
we record marketing costs as an expense in the period to which such costs relate 
we do not defer the recognition of any amounts on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to marketing costs 
we expense advertising costs as incurred  which is the period in which the related advertisement initially appears 
we record consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as a reduction in revenue in the period in which these programs are offered  based on estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
restructuring and asset impairment charges 
we have recorded charges related to employee severance and benefits  asset impairments  contract termination and other associated exit costs during  and the calculation of severance pay requires management to identify employees to be terminated and the timing of their severance from employment 
the calculation of benefits charges requires actuarial assumptions including determination of discount rates 
as discussed further below  the asset impairments were recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires management to estimate the fair value of assets to be disposed of 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
charges related to restructuring activities initiated after this date were recorded when incurred 
prior to this date  charges were recorded at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
these restructuring charges are based on management s best estimate at the time of restructuring 
the status of the restructuring activities is reviewed on a quarterly basis and any adjustments to the reserve  which could differ materially from previous estimates  are recorded as an adjustment to operating income 
purchase accounting 
we account for business combination transactions  including the exchange offer and merger with new valley  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that we allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their fair values as of the acquisition date 
estimates of fair values for the non consolidated real estate businesses of new valley are generally based on independent appraisals and other accounts are based on management s best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable 
the determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment  including developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for the non consolidated real estate businesses 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate our long lived assets for possible impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset  or related group of assets  may not be fully recoverable 
examples of such events or changes in circumstances include a significant adverse charge in the manner in which a long lived asset  or group of assets  is being used or a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset  or group of assets  will be disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
the estimate of fair value of our long lived assets is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets and the results of using other valuation techniques 
since judgment is involved in determining the fair value of long lived assets  there is a risk that the carrying value of our long lived assets may be overstated or understated 

table of contents contingencies 
we record liggett s product liability legal expenses and other litigation costs as operating  selling  general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements and above under the heading recent developments in legislation  regulation and litigation  legal proceedings covering a wide range of matters are pending or threatened in various jurisdictions against liggett 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate with respect to the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending tobacco related litigation or the costs of defending such cases  and we have not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
you should not infer from the absence of any such reserve in our consolidated financial statements that liggett will not be subject to significant tobacco related liabilities in the future 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation 
settlement agreements 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  liggett and vector tobacco are participants in the master settlement agreement  the agreement to settle governmental healthcare cost recovery actions brought by various states 
liggett and vector tobacco have no payment obligations under the master settlement agreement except to the extent their market shares exceed approximately and  respectively  of total cigarettes sold in the united states 
their obligations  and the related expense charges under the master settlement agreement  are subject to adjustments based upon  among other things  the volume of cigarettes sold by liggett and vector tobacco  their relative market shares and inflation 
since relative market shares are based on cigarette shipments  the best estimate of the allocation of charges under the master settlement agreement is recorded in cost of goods sold as the products are shipped 
settlement expenses under the master settlement agreement recorded in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations were  for   for and  for adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
derivatives  beneficial conversion feature 
we measure all derivatives  including certain derivatives embedded in other contracts  at fair value and recognize them in the consolidated balance sheet as an asset or a liability  depending on our rights and obligations under the applicable derivative contract 
in  and  we issued variable interest senior convertible debt in a series of private placements where a portion of the total interest payable on the debt is computed by reference to the cash dividends paid on our common stock 
this portion of the interest payment is considered an embedded derivative within the convertible debt  which we are required to separately value 
as a result  we have bifurcated this embedded derivative and  based on a valuation by a third party  estimated the fair value of the embedded derivative liability 
the resulting discount created by allocating a portion of the issuance proceeds to the embedded derivative is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest method 
at december  and  the fair value of derivative liabilities was estimated at  and  respectively 
changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations as change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
we recognized a gain of in  a gain of  in and a loss of in  due to changes in the fair value of the embedded derivative  which were reported as change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
after giving effect to the recording of embedded derivative liabilities as a discount to the convertible debt  our common stock had a fair value at the issuance date of the notes in excess of the conversion price  resulting in a beneficial conversion feature 
the intrinsic value of the beneficial conversion feature was recorded as additional paid in capital and as a discount on the debt 
the discount is then amortized to interest expense over the term of the debt using the effective interest rate method 
we recognized non cash interest expense of   and for the years ended december   and  respectively  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the embedded 
table of contents derivatives and  in   in and in  due to the amortization of the debt discount attributable to the beneficial conversion feature 
inventories 
tobacco inventories are stated at lower of cost or market and are determined primarily by the last in  first out lifo method at liggett and the first in  first out fifo method at vector tobacco 
although portions of leaf tobacco inventories may not be used or sold within one year because of time required for aging  they are included in current assets  which is common practice in the industry 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
at december   approximately of our leaf inventory was associated with vector tobacco s quest product 
during the second quarter of  we recognized a non cash charge of  to adjust the carrying value of excess leaf tobacco inventory for the quest product  based on estimates of future demand and market conditions 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a non cash charge of to adjust the carrying value of the remaining excess inventory 
stock based compensation 
in january  we adopted sfas no 
 share based payment  under which share based transactions are accounted for using a fair value based method to recognize non cash compensation expense 
prior to adoption  our stock based compensation plans were accounted for in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees with the intrinsic value based method permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation as amended by sfas no

 we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation cost for those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
upon adoption  there was no cumulative adjustment for the impact of the change in accounting principles because the assumed forfeiture rate did not differ significantly from prior periods 
we recognized compensation expense of for the year ended december  as a result of adopting sfas no 

in addition  effective january   as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 payments of dividend equivalent rights on the unexercised portion of stock options are accounted for as reductions in additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet  for the year ended december  
prior to january   in accordance with apb opinion no 
 we accounted for these dividend equivalent rights as additional compensation expense  and  net of taxes  for the years ended december  and  respectively

see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the adoption of this standard 
employee benefit plans 
the determination of our net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense is dependent on our selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
we determine discount rates by using a quantitative analysis that considers the prevailing prices of investment grade bonds and the anticipated cash flow from our two qualified defined benefit plans and our postretirement medical and life insurance plans 
these analyses construct a hypothetical bond portfolio whose cash flow from coupons and maturities match the annual projected cash flows from our pension and retiree health plans 
as of december   our benefit obligations and service cost were computed assuming a discount rate of and  respectively 
in determining our expected rate of return on plan assets we consider input from our external advisors and historical returns based on the expected long term rate of return is the weighted average of the target asset allocation of each individual asset class 
our actual year annual rate of return on our pension plan assets was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we assumed an annual rate of return on our pension plan assets at december  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect our recognized income or expense in such future periods 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences 
table of contents in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our future net pension and other postretirement benefit income or expense 
net pension expense for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit expense aggregated approximately  for  and we currently anticipate such expense will be approximately  for in contrast  our funding obligations under the pension plans are governed by erisa 
to comply with erisa s minimum funding requirements  we do not currently anticipate that we will be required to make any funding to the pension plans for the pension plan year beginning on january  and ending on december  any additional funding obligation that we may have for subsequent years is contingent on several factors and is not reasonably estimable at this time 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of their benefit plans as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur as a component of other comprehensive income 
the funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and its benefit obligation 
in addition  sfas no 
requires an employer to measure benefit plan assets and obligations that determine the funded status of a plan as of the end of its fiscal year 
we presently measure the funded status of its plans at september and the new measurement date requirements become effective for us on december  the prospective requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and to provide the required disclosures became effective for us on december  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in a  reduction of prepaid pension costs  which is classified in other assets  a decrease in an intangible asset of  an increase of  in deferred income taxes  which is also included in other assets  an increase of other accrued current liabilities of  a decrease of non current employee benefits of  which is comprised of a decrease in non current pension liabilities and  in non current postretirement liabilities  and an  increase  net of income taxes to accumulated other comprehensive loss  which is included in stockholders equity

liggett and other united states cigarette manufacturers have been named as defendants in a number of direct and third party actions and purported class actions predicated on the theory that they should be liable for damages from cancer and other adverse health effects alleged to have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to so called secondary smoke from cigarettes 
we believe  and have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that liggett has a number of valid defenses to claims asserted against it 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties 
in june  the jury in an individual case brought under the third phase of the engle case awarded  subsequently reduced by the court to  of compensatory damages against liggett and two other defendants and found liggett responsible for the damages 
plaintiff has recently moved the court to enter final judgment and to tax costs and attorneys fees 
liggett may be required to bond the amount of the judgment against it to perfect its appeal 
in april  a florida state court jury awarded compensatory damages of against liggett in an individual action 
in addition  plaintiff s counsel was awarded legal fees of liggett has appealed the verdict 
it is possible that additional cases could be decided unfavorably and that there could be further adverse developments in the engle case 
liggett may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
management cannot predict the cash requirements related to any future settlements and judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  and there is a risk that those requirements will not be able to be met 
an unfavorable outcome of a pending smoking and health case could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation 
in recent years  there have been a number of adverse regulatory  political and other developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments generally receive widespread media attention 
neither we nor liggett are able to evaluate the effect of these developing matters on pending litigation or the possible commencement of additional litigation or regulation 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and legislation and regulation below for a description of legislation  regulation and litigation 
management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of the cases pending against liggett or the costs of defending such cases 
it is possible that our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome in any such tobacco related litigation

on july   we entered into a settlement with the internal revenue service with respect to the philip morris brand transaction where a subsidiary of liggett contributed three of its premium cigarette brands to trademarks llc  a newly formed limited liability company 
in such transaction  philip morris acquired an option to purchase the remaining interest in trademarks for a day period commencing in december  and we have an option to require philip morris to purchase the remaining interest for a day period commencing in march the company deferred for income tax purposes  a portion of the gain on the transaction until such time as the options were exercised 
in connection with an examination of our and federal income tax returns  the internal revenue service issued to us in september a notice of proposed adjustment 
the notice asserted that  for tax reporting purposes  the entire gain should have been recognized in and in in the additional amounts of  and  respectively  rather than upon the exercise of the options during the day periods commencing in december or in march as part of the settlement  we agreed that  of the gain on the transaction would be recognized by us as income for tax purposes in and that the balance of the remaining gain  net of previously capitalized expenses of   will be recognized by us as income in or upon exercise of the options 

table of contents we paid during the third and fourth quarters of approximately  including interest  with respect to the gain recognized in as a result of the settlement  we reduced  during the third quarter of  the excess portion  of a previously established reserve in our consolidated financial statements  which resulted in a decrease in such amount in reported income tax expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
our consolidated balance sheets include deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which represent temporary differences in the application of accounting rules established by generally accepted accounting principles and income tax laws 
as of december   our deferred income tax liabilities exceeded our deferred income tax assets by  the largest component of our deferred tax liabilities exists because of differences that resulted from the philip morris brand transaction discussed above

payments under the master settlement agreement  discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  and the federal tobacco quota legislation  discussed in legislation and regulation below  are excluded from the table above  as the payments are subject to adjustment for several factors  including inflation  overall industry volume  our market share and the market share of non participating manufacturers 
off balance sheet arrangements we have various agreements in which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters 
generally  these indemnification clauses are included in contracts arising in the normal course of business under which we customarily agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations related to such matters as title to assets sold and licensed or certain intellectual 
table of contents property rights 
payment by us under such indemnification clauses is generally conditioned on the other party making a claim that is subject to challenge by us and dispute resolution procedures specified in the particular contract 
further  our obligations under these arrangements may be limited in terms of time and or amount  and in some instances  we may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by us 
it is not possible to predict the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements due to the conditional nature of our obligations and the unique facts of each particular agreement 
historically  payments made by us under these agreements have not been material 
as of december   we were not aware of any indemnification agreements that would or are reasonably expected to have a current or future material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  in connection with the philip morris brand transaction  eve holdings inc  a subsidiary of liggett  guaranteed a  bank loan to trademarks llc 
the loan is secured by trademarks three premium cigarette brands and trademarks interest in the exclusive license of the three brands by philip morris 
the license provides for a minimum annual royalty payment equal to the annual debt service on the loan plus  we believe that the fair value of eve s guarantee was negligible at december  in december  new valley s subsidiary  western realty development llc  sold all the membership interests in western realty investments llc to andante limited 
in august  andante submitted an indemnification claim to western realty development alleging losses of  from breaches of various representations made in the purchase agreement

in february  liggett vector brands and another cigarette manufacturer entered into a five year agreement with a subsidiary of the american wholesale marketers association to support a program to permit tobacco distributors to secure  on reasonable terms  tax stamp bonds required by state and local governments for the distribution of cigarettes 
under the agreement  liggett vector brands has agreed to pay a portion of losses  if any  incurred by the surety under the bond program  with a maximum loss exposure of for liggett vector brands 
to secure its potential obligations under the agreement  liggett vector brands has delivered to the subsidiary of the association a letter of credit and agreed to fund up to an additional liggett vector brands has incurred no losses to date under this agreement  and we believe the fair value of liggett vector brands obligation under the agreement was immaterial at december  at december   we had outstanding approximately  of letters of credit  collateralized by certificates of deposit 
the letters of credit have been issued as security deposits for leases of office space  to secure the performance of our subsidiaries under various insurance programs and to provide collateral for various subsidiary borrowing and capital lease arrangements 
as of december   new valley has committed to fund up to to a non consolidated real estate business and up to to an investment partnership in which it is an investor 
we have agreed  under certain circumstances  to guarantee up to  of debt of another non consolidated real estate business 
we believe the fair value of our guarantee was negligible at december  market risk we are exposed to market risks principally from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we seek to minimize these risks through our regular operating and financing activities and our long term investment strategy 
our market risk management procedures cover all market risk sensitive financial instruments 
as of december   approximately  of our outstanding debt at face value had variable interest rates determined by various interest rate indices  which increases the risk of fluctuating interest rates 
our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our variable rate borrowings  which could adversely affect our cash flows 
as of december   we had no interest rate caps or swaps 

table of contents based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual interest expense could increase or decrease by approximately in addition  as of december   approximately   principal amount of outstanding debt had a variable interest rate determined by the amount of the dividends on our common stock 
included in the difference between the stated value of the debt and carrying value are embedded derivatives  which were estimated at  at december  changes to the fair value of these embedded derivatives are reflected quarterly within the company s statements of operations as change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt 
the value of the embedded derivative is contingent on changes in interest rates of debt instruments maturing over the duration of the convertible debt as well as projections of future cash and stock dividends over the term of the debt 
based on a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  our annual change in fair value of derivatives embedded within convertible debt could increase or decrease by approximately  with approximately resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our variable interest senior convertible notes due and the remaining  resulting from the embedded derivative associated with our variable interest senior convertible debentures due an increase in our quarterly dividend rate by per share would increase interest expense by approximately  per year

legislation and regulation reports with respect to the alleged harmful physical effects of cigarette smoking have been publicized for many years and  in the opinion of liggett s management  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales 
since  the surgeon general of the united states and the secretary of health and human services have released a number of reports which state that cigarette smoking is a causative factor with respect to a variety of health hazards  including cancer  heart disease and lung disease  and have recommended various government actions to reduce the incidence of smoking 
in  liggett publicly 
table of contents acknowledged that  as the surgeon general and respected medical researchers have found  smoking causes health problems  including lung cancer  heart and vascular disease  and emphysema 
since  federal law has required that cigarettes manufactured  packaged or imported for sale or distribution in the united states include specific health warnings on their packaging 
since  liggett and the other cigarette manufacturers have included the federally required warning statements in print advertising and on certain categories of point of sale display materials relating to cigarettes 
the federal cigarette labeling and advertising act fcla act requires that packages of cigarettes distributed in the united states and cigarette advertisements in the united states bear one of the following four warning statements surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy  surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health  surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight  and surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
the law also requires that each person who manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
annual reports to the united states congress are also required from the secretary of health and human services as to current information on the health consequences of smoking and from the federal trade commission ftc on the effectiveness of cigarette labeling and current practices and methods of cigarette advertising and promotion 
both federal agencies are also required annually to make such recommendations as they deem appropriate with regard to further legislation 
it is possible that proposed legislation providing for regulation of cigarettes by the food and drug administration fda  if enacted  could significantly change the warning requirements currently mandated by the fcla act 
in addition  since  liggett has included the warning smoking is addictive on its cigarette packages 
in january  the environmental protection agency epa released a report on the respiratory effect of secondary smoke which concludes that secondary smoke is a known human lung carcinogen in adults and in children  causes increased respiratory tract disease and middle ear disorders and increases the severity and frequency of asthma 
in june  the two largest of the major domestic cigarette manufacturers  together with other segments of the tobacco and distribution industries  commenced a lawsuit against the epa seeking a determination that the epa did not have the statutory authority to regulate secondary smoke  and that given the scientific evidence and the epa s failure to follow its own guidelines in making the determination  the epa s classification of secondary smoke was arbitrary and capricious 
in july  a federal district court vacated those sections of the report relating to lung cancer  finding that the epa may have reached different conclusions had it complied with relevant statutory requirements 
the federal government appealed the court s ruling 
in december  the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit rejected the industry challenge to the epa report ruling that it was not subject to court review 
issuance of the report may encourage efforts to limit smoking in public areas 
in august  the fda filed in the federal register a final rule classifying tobacco as a drug or medical device  asserting jurisdiction over the manufacture and marketing of tobacco products and imposing restrictions on the sale  advertising and promotion of tobacco products 
litigation was commenced challenging the legal authority of the fda to assert such jurisdiction  as well as challenging the constitutionality of the rule 
in march  the united states supreme court ruled that the fda does not have the power to regulate tobacco 
liggett supported the fda rule and began to phase in compliance with certain of the proposed fda regulations 
since the supreme court decision  various proposals and recommendations have been made for additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers 
congressional advocates of fda regulations have introduced legislation that would give the fda authority to regulate the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health  thereby allowing the fda to reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional regulations 
in october  the senate passed a bill  which did not become law  providing for fda regulation of tobacco products 
a substantially similar bill was reintroduced in congress in february the ultimate outcome of these proposals cannot be predicted  but fda regulation of tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents in august  massachusetts enacted legislation requiring tobacco companies to publish information regarding the ingredients in cigarettes and other tobacco products sold in that state 
in december  the united states court of appeals for the first circuit ruled that the ingredients disclosure provisions violated the constitutional prohibition against unlawful seizure of property by forcing firms to reveal trade secrets 
liggett began voluntarily complying with this legislation in december by providing ingredient information to the massachusetts department of public health and  notwithstanding the appellate court s ruling  has continued to provide ingredient disclosure 
liggett and vector tobacco also provide ingredient information annually  as required by law  to the states of texas and minnesota 
several other states are considering ingredient disclosure legislation  and the senate bill providing for fda regulation also calls for  among other things  ingredient disclosure 
in october  the fair and equitable tobacco reform act of fetra was signed into law 
fetra provides for the elimination of the federal tobacco quota and price support program through an industry funded buyout of tobacco growers and quota holders 
pursuant to the legislation  manufacturers of tobacco products will be assessed  over a ten year period to compensate tobacco growers and quota holders for the elimination of their quota rights 
cigarette manufacturers will initially be responsible for of the assessment subject to adjustment in the future  which will be allocated based on relative unit volume of domestic cigarette shipments 
management currently estimates that liggett s and vector tobacco s assessment will be approximately  for the third year of the program which began january  the relative cost of the legislation to the three largest cigarette manufacturers will likely be less than the cost to smaller manufacturers  including liggett and vector tobacco  because one effect of the legislation is that the three largest manufacturers will no longer be obligated to make certain contractual payments  commonly known as phase ii payments  that they agreed in to make to tobacco producing states 
the ultimate impact of this legislation cannot be determined  but there is a risk that smaller manufacturers  such as liggett and vector tobacco  will be disproportionately affected by the legislation  which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing federal  state and local excise taxes 
the federal excise tax on cigarettes is currently per pack 
state and local sales and excise taxes vary considerably and  when combined with sales taxes  local taxes and the current federal excise tax  may currently exceed per pack 
in  eight states enacted increases in excise taxes 
further increases from other states are expected 
congress has considered and is currently considering significant increases in the federal excise tax or other payments from tobacco manufacturers  and various states and other jurisdictions have currently under consideration or pending legislation proposing further state excise tax increases 
management believes increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse effect on sales of cigarettes 
various states have adopted or are considering legislation establishing reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes 
compliance with this legislation could be burdensome and costly 
in june  the new york state legislature passed legislation charging the state s office of fire prevention and control with developing standards for self extinguishing or reduced ignition propensity cigarettes 
all cigarettes manufactured for sale in new york state must be manufactured to specific reduced ignition propensity standards set forth in the regulations 
liggett and vector tobacco are in compliance with the new york reduced ignition propensity regulatory requirements 
since the passage of the new york law  the states of vermont  california  new hampshire and illinois have passed similar laws utilizing the same technical standards  effective on may   january   october  and january   respectively 
massachusetts has also recently enacted reduced ignition propensity standards for cigarettes  although currently there is no effective date for the legislation 
similar legislation is being considered by other state governments and at the federal level 
compliance with such legislation could harm the business of liggett and vector tobacco  particularly if there were to be varying standards from state to state 
federal or state regulators may object to vector tobacco s low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products and reduced risk cigarette products it may develop as unlawful or allege they bear deceptive or unsubstantiated product claims  and seek the removal of the products from the marketplace or significant changes to advertising 
various concerns regarding vector tobacco s advertising practices have been expressed to vector tobacco by certain state attorneys general 
vector tobacco has previously engaged in 
table of contents discussions in an effort to resolve these concerns and vector tobacco has  in the interim  suspended all print advertising for its quest brand 
if vector tobacco is ultimately unable to advertise its quest brand  it could have a material adverse effect on sales of quest 
allegations by federal or state regulators  public health organizations and other tobacco manufacturers that vector tobacco s products are unlawful  or that its public statements or advertising contain misleading or unsubstantiated health claims or product comparisons  may result in litigation or governmental proceedings 
vector tobacco s business may become subject to extensive domestic and international governmental regulation 
various proposals have been made for federal  state and international legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers generally  and reduced constituent cigarettes specifically 
it is possible that laws and regulations may be adopted covering issues like the manufacture  sale  distribution  advertising and labeling of tobacco products as well as any express or implied health claims associated with reduced risk  low nicotine and nicotine free cigarette products and the use of genetically modified tobacco 
a system of regulation by agencies such as the fda  the ftc or the united states department of agriculture may be established 
the ftc has expressed interest in the regulation of tobacco products which bear reduced carcinogen claims 
the ultimate outcome of any of the foregoing cannot be predicted  but any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
a wide variety of federal  state and local laws limit the advertising  sale and use of cigarettes  and these laws have proliferated in recent years 
for example  many local laws prohibit smoking in restaurants and other public places  and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace 
there are various other legislative efforts pending on the federal and state level which seek to  among other things  eliminate smoking in public places  further restrict displays and advertising of cigarettes  require additional warnings  including graphic warnings  on cigarette packaging and advertising  ban vending machine sales and curtail affirmative defenses of tobacco companies in product liability litigation 
this trend has had  and is likely to continue to have  an adverse effect on us 
in addition to the foregoing  there have been a number of other restrictive regulatory actions  adverse legislative and political decisions and other unfavorable developments concerning cigarette smoking and the tobacco industry 
these developments may negatively affect the perception of potential triers of fact with respect to the tobacco industry  possibly to the detriment of certain pending litigation  and may prompt the commencement of additional similar litigation or legislation
