item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statement this report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private litigation reform act of some of the forward looking statements can be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  approximately  intends  plans  estimates  projects  strategy  or anticipates  or the negative of those words or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements  including those factors described in risk factors under item a in this form k 
some factors include changes in governmental  legislative and environmental restrictions  catastrophic losses from fires  floods  windstorms  earthquakes  volcanic eruptions  insect infestations or diseases  as well as changes in economic conditions and competition in our domestic and export markets and other factors described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
in addition  factors that could cause our actual results to differ from those contemplated by our projected  forecasted  estimated or budgeted results as reflected in forward looking statements relating to our operations and business include  but are not limited to the failure to meet our expectations with respect to our likely future performance  an unanticipated reduction in the demand for timber products and or an unanticipated increase in supply of timber products  an unanticipated reduction in demand for higher and better use timberlands or non strategic timberlands  our failure to make strategic acquisitions or to integrate any such acquisitions effectively or  conversely  our failure to make strategic divestitures  and our failure to qualify as a real estate investment trust  or reit 
it is likely that if one or more of the risks materializes  or if one or more assumptions prove to be incorrect  the current expectations of plum creek and its management will not be realized 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date made  and neither plum creek nor its management undertakes any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements 
overview operating performance compared to operating income increased by million to million in this increase was due primarily to the one time gain of million in connection with the settlement of the canadian lumber dispute 
see note of the notes to financial statements  other operating income operating income in our northern resources segment increased by million to million in this increase was due primarily to million of operating income associated with our november acquisition of  acres of timberlands in michigan  offset in part by lower sawlog prices and higher per ton log and haul rates 
operating income in our southern resources segment decreased by million  or  to million 
this decrease was due primarily to a weaker product mix  lower sawlog prices and higher per ton log and haul rates 
during  we substantially completed the conversion of numerous natural stands to plantations  and therefore  the percentage of large diameter sawlogs harvested in decreased and the percentage of small diameter sawlogs and pulpwood increased 
operating income decreased by million as a result of this conversion 
operating income from our real estate segment increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was due primarily to our expanding real estate development business and selling a higher percentage of high value properties and a lower percentage of low value properties 
during  operating income associated with our real estate development business was million compared to an operating loss of million during k 
table of contents operating income for our manufactured products segment decreased by million to million 
this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber prices  higher plywood manufacturing costs and higher mdf raw material costs  offset in part by higher mdf prices 
our operating income in and has been significantly impacted by higher per ton log and haul rates 
in our northern resources segment  operating income was negatively impacted by million in compared to and by an additional million in compared to additionally  in our southern resources segment  operating income was negatively impacted by million in compared to and by an additional million in compared to the per ton increase in log and haul rates is due primarily to higher fuel costs and longer hauling distances 
our earnings were also impacted by higher interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million 
this increase was due primarily to the issuance of million senior notes due in connection with our acquisition of timberlands in michigan for million in november and our repurchase of approximately million shares of our common stock for million during key economic factors impacting our business our operating performance is impacted primarily by the supply and demand for logs and wood products in the united states 
the short term supply of logs is impacted primarily by weather and the level of harvesting activities 
the demand for logs in the united states is impacted by housing starts  repair and remodeling activities and the amount of imported lumber  primarily from canada 
during and  housing starts were million and million  respectively 
we believe housing starts in and were at unsustainable levels due to low interest rates and speculative buying 
housing starts during decreased by to million starts and are expected to decline further in the further decline is due in part to higher interest rates  increased inventory of unsold homes and higher vacancy rates 
thirty year fixed rate interest rates increased from during to during at the end of  there was over a six month supply of new homes for sale compared to a four and one half month supply at the end of during  the demand for sawlogs weakened due to mill shutdowns and curtailments as a result of the slowdown in home construction and repair and remodeling activity 
repair and remodeling activities decreased during and are expected to decline further during due to the decline in home sales and lower home price appreciation 
the demand for sawlogs in is expected to remain weak until housing starts improve 
currency exchange rates  tariffs and quotas  availability and cost of transportation  and the relative cost of manufacturing wood products impact imports of lumber and other wood products into the united states 
canadian imports into the us capture a significant share approximately of the us lumber market 
a us industry coalition believes the canadian government  which owns most of the timberlands in canada  provides unfair subsidies by selling timber at below market prices 
prior to  a trade agreement with canada limited imports of lumber into the united states 
since may  the us has imposed duties on canadian imports 
near the end of  the us and canadian governments reached a negotiated settlement 
under the terms of the settlement  approximately billion of the previously collected billion in duties were refunded to canadian lumber producers 
furthermore  the previously imposed duties were replaced with a system of tiered taxes and or volume restrictions 
it is too early to tell if the new system of excise taxes and volume restrictions will significantly impact lumber imports from canada and therefore favorably impact the demand for sawlogs 
real estate sales and development properties we estimate that included in our million acres of timberlands are approximately million acres of higher and better use timberlands and about  acres of non strategic timberlands 
the higher and better use timberlands are expected to be sold over the next years for residential  recreational or conservation purposes 
the non strategic timberlands are expected to be sold over the next five years 
included within the million acres of higher and better use timberlands are approximately  acres that will be developed either internally or through joint ventures 
during  we sold approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands and approximately  acres of higher and better use recreational properties 
we expect to significantly increase the number of acres we sell in in both of these categories 
sales are expected to remain at this higher level in future years  however  the mix between non strategic timberland k 
table of contents sales and higher and better use recreational property sales could change 
furthermore  in our average price per acre for non strategic timberlands is likely to be lower than the price per acre we realized during also  due to mix considerations  our average price per acre for higher and better use recreational property sales are expected to be lower than the price per acre we realized during we continued to grow our land development business during we have identified  acres with an estimated properties that we expect to develop internally over the next years 
at december   we had internal development properties entitled and an additional in the planning process 
revenue from sales of development properties was million during  which included revenue of million from one sale we had been working on for several years 
we are continuing to build a portfolio of internal development projects we can bring to the market and expect to reach our level of sustained sales either in the second half of or our development business is conducted through our wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries 
additionally  we have identified  acres that we expect to develop through joint ventures 
we have entered into six joint venture arrangements covering approximately  acres 
we do not expect significant revenues from these joint venture arrangements during we are the minority partner in each of these joint ventures  and our involvement is limited to selling and or contributing land and exercising certain protective rights 
we expect to enter into additional joint venture arrangements during harvest levels the volume of trees we harvest each year and the percentage of sawlogs and pulpwood included in our annual harvest also impact our operating performance 
during  we harvested a total of million tons compared to a total of million tons during the increase in harvest levels is due primarily to our november acquisition of  acres of timberlands in michigan and a temporary increase in harvest levels to capture favorable log prices  especially during the first half of we expect harvest levels during to range between and million tons 
however  future harvest levels may vary from historic levels due to weak markets  to take advantage of favorable prices or due to factors outside of our control  such as weather and fires 
future harvest levels may also be impacted by our sale of timberlands and the extent to which proceeds are reinvested in core timberlands 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition timber sales revenues are recognized when legal ownership and the risk of loss transfer to the purchaser and the quantity sold is determinable 
we sell timber under delivered log agreements and through sales of standing timber or stumpage using pay as cut contracts and lump sum sale agreements 
delivered log sales 
under a delivered log sale agreement  we harvest the timber and deliver it to the buyer 
revenue is recognized when the log is delivered as risk of loss and title transfer to the buyer 
with delivered log sales  we incur the cost of logging and hauling 
pay as cut contracts 
pay as cut contracts are agreements in which the buyer agrees to harvest all of the timber on a tract of land for an agreed upon price for each type of tree over the term of the contract usually to months 
in some cases  an advance is received in connection with pay as cut contracts 
in other cases  the buyer agrees to harvest only certain trees on a tract of land 
under pay as cut contracts  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
revenue is recognized when the timber is harvested  as title and risk of loss has transferred to the buyer 
total revenue recognized under a pay as cut contract is the total volume of wood removed multiplied by the unit price for each type of tree 
k 
table of contents lump sum sale agreements 
under a lump sum sale agreement  the buyer and seller agree to a total lump sum price for all the timber available for harvest on a tract of land 
generally  the lump sum price is paid when the contract is signed 
title to the timber and risk of loss transfers to the buyer as the timber is harvested 
lump sum sales are generally marketed and sold to the highest bidder 
bids are typically based on a timber cruise  which is an estimate of the total volume of timber on a tract of land broken down by the various types of trees such as softwood sawlogs  hardwood pulpwood  etc under a lump sum sale  the buyer is responsible for all logging and hauling costs 
total revenue recognized under a lump sum sale contract usually to months is the amount of the highest bid  and is not dependent upon the volume or type of trees actually harvested 
since revenue is recognized under a lump sum sale agreement as the timber is cut  we estimate the amount of revenue to recognize each month based on actual harvested volume compared to the total volume available for harvest according to the timber cruise 
we generally receive weekly information from the buyer reporting how much volume has been harvested 
additionally  we gather information by observing the tract to estimate the timber volume harvested 
in most cases  the total volume harvested from a tract of land is different than the volume estimated in the timber cruise 
if the total volume harvested is greater than the cruise estimated volume  we will stop recognizing revenue once the total revenue recognized is equal to the total lump sum contract price 
no revenue will be recognized for volumes harvested in excess of the cruise estimated volume 
if the total volume removed is less than the cruise estimated volume  an adjustment will be recorded in the month in which we learn of the difference 
the adjustment is an increase in revenue equal to the difference between the total revenue recognized to date and the total lump sum contract price 
finally  for our larger lump sum contracts  which cover multiple tracts  we adjust revenues at the end of each accounting period for any known trends in the tracts that have been completely harvested 
for lump sum contracts completed during the past twelve quarters  our largest quarterly adjustment to record the difference between estimated lump sum revenues and actual revenues has been million 
the following table summarizes amounts recognized under each method from sales to external customers in the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december in millions revenues from delivered log sales pay as cut sales lump sum sales substantially all of our timber sales in the northern resources segment are under delivered log sale agreements 
in our southern resources segment  approximately one third of our timber sales consists of either pay as cut contracts or lump sum sales 
since under both pay as cut contracts and lump sum sales the buyer is responsible for the logging and hauling costs  the operating profit as a percentage of revenue is significantly higher in our southern resources segment 
real estate sales 
we estimate that included in the company s approximately million acres of timberlands are about million acres of higher and better use timberlands  which are expected to be sold and or developed over the next years for residential  recreational or conservation purposes 
in addition  the company has approximately  acres of non strategic timberlands  which are expected to be sold over the next five years 
in the meantime  these timberlands continue to be used productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the availability of government and not for profit funding  the general state of the economy  the ability to obtain entitlements  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation and the timing of harvesting activities 
as a result  the timing of our real estate sales may materially impact our reported operating income and net income 
during  the real estate segment reported an operating profit percentage of approximately 
we estimate our real estate segment s annual operating profit percentage could range from to of revenues 
the operating profit percentage depends on the nature of the interest sold and how much the market value of the property has risen over its book value 
for example  the sale of conservation easements will have an operating profit percentage of close to because no book basis is allocated to this type of revenue 
sales of recently acquired properties will generally have relatively lower operating profit percentages while sales of properties held for a long time will tend to have relatively higher operating profit percentages 
sales of timberlands owned by plum creek prior to the timber company merger  which  for accounting purposes  were deemed acquired as of the merger date  will thus have lower operating profit percentages since these properties were recorded at appraised value as of october k 
table of contents in connection with major timberland acquisitions we are generally not able to identify our future real estate sales 
however  while our purchase price allocation and related appraisals reflected greater values for real estate which may be sold in the future for uses which have a higher value than timber production  we are generally not able to identify specific properties 
therefore  in connection with our purchase price allocation for timberland acquisitions  the greater values for real estate are allocated proportionately among all the acres acquired  except when we can specifically identify properties 
in general  however  timberlands are acquired primarily for long term use in our timber operations and specific properties cannot be identified in advance because their value is dependent upon numerous factors  most of which are not known at the acquisition date  including current and future zoning restrictions  current and future environmental restrictions  future changes in demographics  future changes in the economy  current and future plans of adjacent landowners  and current and future funding of government and not for profit conservation and recreation programs 
we believe that current and future results of operations could be materially different under different purchase price allocation assumptions  and generally  when we acquire properties  we do not have the ability  with any level of precision  to estimate which of the acquired properties will someday sell for more than their underlying timber production value 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our ability to recover the net investment in long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets used in a business when the carrying value net book value of the assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to those assets over their expected useful life 
impairment losses are measured by the extent to which the carrying value of a group of assets exceeds the fair value of such assets at a given point in time 
when the fair values of the assets are not available  we estimate the fair values by using the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the assets 
the cash flows are discounted at the risk free rates of interest 
future cash flow estimates are based on probability weighted projections for a range of possible outcomes 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires recognition of an impairment loss in connection with long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of the assets exceeds an amount equal to their fair value less selling costs 
we have grown substantially through acquisitions in recent years 
the purchase price of these acquisitions has been allocated to our timber and timberlands including assets held for sale and real estate development properties and property  plant and equipment 
the allocation of the purchase price in a business combination is highly subjective 
management is required to estimate the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date 
subsequent to the original allocation  these assets are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable through future operations 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets be grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are independent cash flows 
we track cash flows for our million acres of timberlands by grouping them into eight geographic areas in the northern resources segment and eight geographic areas in the southern resources segment 
additionally  we track cash flows for each of our ten manufacturing facilities 
timber and timberlands used in our business 
sfas no 
provides that for assets used in a business  an impairment loss is recorded only when the carrying value of those assets is not recoverable through future operations 
the recoverability test is based on undiscounted future cash flows over the expected life of the assets 
we use one harvest cycle which ranges between and years for evaluating the recoverability of our timber and timberlands 
because of the inherently long life of timber and timberlands  we do not expect to incur an impairment loss in the future for the timber and timberlands used in our business 
timber and timberlands held for sale 
sfas no 
provides that an impairment loss is recognized for long lived assets held for sale when the carrying value of those assets exceeds an amount equal to its fair value less selling costs 
an asset is generally considered to be held for sale when we have committed to a plan to sell the asset  the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition  we have initiated an active program to locate a buyer  and the sale is expected to close within one year 
during  the above criteria were met by a number of our timberland properties  and we recognized impairment losses of million 
similarly  we recognized impairment losses of million in and million during in connection with timberlands held for sale see note of the notes to financial statements 
we expect to continue to sell or exchange non strategic timberlands to other forest products companies or non industrial investors  and it is probable that we will recognize  in accordance with sfas no 
 additional impairment losses in the future in connection with sales of non strategic timberlands 
k 
table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 an impairment loss is generally not recorded until management has concluded that it is probable ie  likely that timberlands will be sold within the next months 
for many properties that are currently being actively marketed  it is difficult to conclude whether they will be sold within one year and estimate the price 
nevertheless  management performs a probability assessment for all properties that are being actively marketed and records an impairment loss to the extent the property s book basis exceeds its estimated fair value net of selling cost in the quarter in which management has concluded it is likely the property will be sold within months based on its best estimate of fair value 
property  plant and equipment 
the carrying value of property  plant and equipment represents primarily the net book value of our ten manufacturing facilities 
each manufacturing facility is tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable through future operations 
the estimated future cash flows over the remaining useful life of a manufacturing facility is highly subjective and is dependent upon estimates for future product pricing  raw material costs  volumes of product sold  and residual value of the facility 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million in connection with one of our lumber mills due to a declining supply of logs 
the availability of logs in close proximity to our mills has been declining and is expected to decline further in the future 
we currently estimate that the carrying value for our ten manufacturing facilities is recoverable through future operations and that our estimate of future cash flows is reasonable 
however  if wood product prices were to remain weak at current levels for an extended period of time  or if log or raw material availability declines more than expected  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for one or more of its manufacturing facilities in a future period 
depletion depletion  or costs attributed to timber harvested  is recorded as trees are harvested 
depletion rates for each region are adjusted at least annually 
depletion rates are computed by dividing a the sum of the original cost of the timber less previously recorded depletion plus estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation  that are expected to be incurred over the next harvest cycle  by b the total timber volume that is estimated to be harvested over the harvest cycle 
the harvest cycle can be as short as years in the south to as long as years in the north 
the estimate of future silviculture costs is limited to the expenditures that are expected to impact growth rates over the harvest cycle 
the depletion rate calculations do not include an estimate for either future reforestation costs associated with a stand s final harvest or future volume in connection with the replanting of a stand subsequent to its final harvest 
k 
table of contents the following table summarizes depletion expense recognized in the company s financial statements  key assumptions and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december dollars in millions  except per ton amounts depletion expense northern resources segment southern resources segment a total depletion expense average depletion rates per ton northern resources segment southern resources segment assumptions used to determine the average depletion rates estimated future silviculture costs  including the impact of inflation northern resources segment southern resources segment b estimated future volume in million tons northern resources segment southern resources segment c sensitivity of results to changes in key assumptions increase in depletion expense for a increase in estimated future silviculture costs d northern resources segment southern resources segment decrease in estimated future volume e northern resources segment southern resources segment a depletion expense for includes a million loss  representing the book basis of timber volume destroyed as a result of severe winds from hurricane katrina 
b reflects an increase in our estimates of future costs associated with fertilization treatments due to higher chemical and application costs and more acres treated 
c decrease in estimated future volumes from is due primarily to the timing of replanting timber stands following final harvest 
d assumes future timber volumes do not change 
e assumes future silviculture costs do not change 
significant estimates and judgments are required to determine both future silviculture costs and the volume of timber available for harvest over the harvest cycle 
some of the factors impacting the estimates are changes in weather patterns  inflation rates  the cost of fertilizers and chemicals  the cost of capital  the actual and estimated increase in growth rates from fertilizer applications  the relative price of sawlogs and pulpwood  the actual and expected real price appreciation of timber  the scientific advancement in seedling and growing technology  and changes in harvest cycles 
we have invested in technology that enables us to predict our current standing inventory of trees  future growth rates  and the benefits of scientific advancements in connection with seedlings  planting techniques and fertilizer applications 
therefore  while estimates with respect to depletion computations will be revised at least annually  we do not expect the depletion rates will change materially from year to year 
deferred income taxes plum creek has elected to be taxed as a reit under sections of the united states internal revenue code 
a reit is generally not subject to corporate level income tax if it distributes of its taxable income to shareholders and satisfies other organizational and operational requirements as set forth in the internal revenue code 
if a company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  it will be subject to federal income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
k 
table of contents as a consequence of the october  merger with the timber company  which involved merging a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level tax built in gains tax if the company makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the merger with the timber company within the ten year period following the merger date 
the built in gains tax applies to gains from such asset sales to the extent that the fair value of the property exceeds its tax basis at the merger date 
built in gains tax is generally not payable on dispositions of property to the extent the proceeds from such dispositions are reinvested in qualifying like kind replacement property 
the built in gains tax does not apply to income generated from the harvesting and sale of timber 
in connection with our merger with the timber company  we wrote off all of the timber company s deferred income tax liability related to timber and timberlands except for million 
the million deferred income tax liability relates to the book tax basis difference of timber and timberlands that were expected to be sold  and subject to  the built in gains tax during the ten year period ending october  during the period october  to december   the million deferred income tax liability was reduced by million due to the payment of tax in connection with sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  we remeasure the amount of deferred income taxes needed in connection with expected sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax each quarterly reporting period 
in  we reduced the deferred tax liability to million and correspondingly recorded a deferred tax benefit of million 
based on projected timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax for the period december  to october   and our ability to successfully reinvest proceeds in like kind properties  we estimate we need a deferred tax liability of million 
as a result  no adjustment to the deferred tax liability associated with expected sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax was made in it is likely that actual timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax over the ten year period will be greater than  or less than  our current projection 
an adjustment to earnings will be required in the period in which it is determined that timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax will be greater than  or less than  our current projection 
accounting for share based compensation plum creek has a stockholder approved stock incentive plan that provides for the award of non qualified stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  value management awards and dividend equivalents 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r effective january  see note of the notes to financial statements 
grants of both value management awards and dividend equivalents represent awards that are classified and accounted for as liabilities under sfas no 
r 
as a result  the expense recognized over the performance period for both value management awards and dividend equivalents will equal the fair value ie  cash value of an award as of the last day of the performance period multiplied by the number of awards that are earned 
furthermore  sfas no 
r requires the quarterly expense recognized during the performance period to be based on the fair value of value management awards and dividend equivalents as of the end of the most recent quarter 
prior to the end of the performance period  compensation costs for value management awards and dividend equivalents are based on the awards most recent quarterly fair values and the number of months of service rendered during the performance period 
fair values for value management awards and dividend equivalents are computed based on our historical relative total shareholder return compared to the performance of peer groups consisting of forest products companies  the s p index and the morgan stanley reit index over the same period peer group 
the simulated total shareholder return of the company and the peer groups is computed using a monte carlo simulation 
the key assumptions used in the simulation of the company s and the peer group s total shareholder return are volatility  beta the measure of how plum creek s stock moves relative to the market as a whole  risk free interest rate  and expected dividend yield 
additionally  the fair value of dividend equivalents assumes that our current quarterly dividend of the company s common stock of per share will remain constant through the end of the performance period 
k 
table of contents the fair value liability for outstanding value management awards and dividend equivalents at december  was million  which is based on the current fair value of outstanding awards multiplied by the percentage of months worked during the performance period 
the liability at december  could range between million and million based on the possible fair value of all outstanding liability based awards 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we could have a material adjustment to our share based compensation liability to the extent there is a material change in the fair value of our value management awards and dividend equivalents during the quarter 
pensions plum creek provides pension benefits under defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of our employees 
see note of the notes to financial statements 
we maintain a qualified defined benefit pension plan and two supplemental non qualified defined benefit pension plans 
participants benefits generally vest after five years of service 
the cash balance benefits for salaried employees is determined based primarily on certain percentages of compensation  age  years of service and interest accrued based on the year treasury bond rate 
furthermore  employees of the company on september   earn benefits based on the greater of the cash balance formula or a monthly pension benefit that is principally based on the highest monthly average earnings during any consecutive sixty month out of the last month period and the number of years of service credit 
the benefits to hourly employees are generally based on a fixed amount per year of service 
plum creek s contributions to its qualified pension plan vary from year to year  but the company has made at least the minimum contributions required by law in each year 
generally  we intend to fund our qualified pension plan annually by either the value of the benefits earned during the year or  if more  the amount such that the fair value of plan assets equals or exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation abo  the approximate actuarially computed current pension obligation if the plan was discontinued 
the company has the same funding policy for the non qualified plan 
however  assets related to the non qualified plans are held in a grantor trust and are subject to the claims of creditors 
the computation of the company s benefit obligation  pension cost and accrued pension liability under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain assumptions involving primarily the following weighted average rates assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at december discount rate a rate of compensation increase c assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost discount rate expected long term return on plan assets b rate of compensation increase c a the december   discount rate was determined by the resulting yield of a hypothetical bond portfolio at december   matched to the expected benefit payments under the plans 
bonds selected for this portfolio had a moody s or standard poor s credit rating of aa or better as of december  b the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption is based on the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds  the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns on each asset class 
the expected return for each asset class is weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption for the portfolio 
c the assumed rate of increase of future compensation levels represents our long term estimate of such increases on the basis of the composition of plan participants  past results and market expectations 
other key assumptions used in the estimate include primarily those underlying the mortality table  and expected long term rates for inflation  retirement and withdrawals  all of which are based on plan experience and standard actuarial methods but which are nevertheless subject to uncertainty 
k 
table of contents it is likely that the actual return on plan assets and the outcome of other uncertain variables will differ from those used in estimating our pension costs and pension obligation reflected in our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
furthermore  the company may  from time to time  adjust the asset allocation  which may have an impact on the long term rate of return on plan assets 
the following table summarizes key financial measures and sensitivities to changes in assumptions for the years ended december in millions key financial measures pension expense cash pension plan contributions qualified plan cash grantor trust funding supplemental plans current accrued pension liability a non current accrued pension liability a sensitivity to changes in key assumptions increase in pension expense for every percentage point decrease in long term rate of return on plan assets decrease in weighted average discount rate increase in rate of increase in compensation levels increase in qualified pension funding for every percentage point decrease in weighted average discount rate a we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no

 we are required to recognize the funded status for our defined benefit plans in our december   consolidated balance sheet 
assuming an average long term rate of return on plan assets of  a weighted average discount rate of for and for and beyond  and a rate of increase in compensation levels  we project that our annual pension expense for and will be approximately million each and for and will be million each 
over the same time period  the annual cash funding required under our present funding policy and current funding rules for the qualified pension plan is expected to be approximately million annually through and million in given the well funded nature of the plan  we believe the pension protection act of will not have a material affect on our funding requirements

c we have not included any amounts for our other long term liabilities  as we cannot estimate when we will be obligated to satisfy these liabilities 
at december   other long term liabilities include workers compensation of million  deferred compensation obligations of million  non qualified pension obligations of million including million classified as a current liability  and qualified pension obligations of million 
we expect to fund approximately million for workers compensation payments in we have made contributions to our qualified pension plan such that the fair value of the pension plan assets at december   exceeds the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation 
as a result of this funding level  there are no qualified pension funding obligations at december  we have two grantor trusts  which hold assets associated with our deferred compensation obligations and non qualified pension obligations 
at december   the fair value of assets in one of our grantor trusts is approximately equal to our deferred compensation obligation of million 
additionally  at december   the fair value of assets in the other grantor trust and the actuarially computed accumulated benefit obligation for our non qualified pension plans was million each 
assets in our grantor trusts have been reserved for the above obligations 
however  grantor trust assets are subject to the claims of creditors in the event of bankruptcy 
see notes and of the notes to financial statements 
events and trends affecting operating results harvest plans we determine our annual roundwood sawlogs and pulpwood  including stumpage sales harvesting plans based on a number of factors 
at the stand level  ranging in size from to acres  we consider the age  size  density  health and economic maturity of the timber 
a stand is a contiguous block of trees of a similar age  species mix and silvicultural regime 
at the forest level  ranging in size from  to almost  acres  we consider the long term sustainability and environmental impact of certain levels of harvesting  certain external conditions such as supply agreements  and the level of demand for wood within the region 
a forest is a broad administrative unit  made up of a large number of stands 
harvest scheduling is the technical approach using computer modeling that considers all of the above factors along with forest growth rates and financial assumptions to project future harvest plans for a number of years forward 
our actual harvest levels may vary from planned levels due to log demand  sales prices  the availability of timber from other sources  the level of timberland sales and acquisitions  the availability of legal access  abnormal weather conditions  fires and other factors outside of our control 
we believe that our harvest plans are sufficiently flexible to permit modification in response to short term fluctuations in the markets for logs 
furthermore  future harvest levels will be impacted by both our planned sales of non strategic and higher and better use timberlands 
the impact will depend on the level and extent we are able to reinvest proceeds in productive timberlands and the stocking levels and age class distribution of any newly acquired timberlands

table of contents harvest levels in the northern resources segment were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during our harvest levels and change in mix were due primarily to our acquisition of  acres of timberland in michigan during the fourth quarter of excluding the michigan timberlands  our harvest levels were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during we expect harvest levels in the northern resources segment in to decrease between and from  however  the log mix is expected to remain consistent with harvest levels in the southern resources segment were million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during and million tons sawlogs and pulpwood during in  we expect harvest levels will be flat to lower from and the log mix in the southern resources segment is expected to remain consistent with us canada softwood lumber agreement historically  canada has been a significant source of lumber for the us market  particularly in the new home construction market 
a trade agreement concerning lumber imports between the us and canada expired in march soon thereafter  a us industry coalition  of which plum creek is a member  submitted anti dumping and countervailing duty petitions to the international trade commission and the us department of commerce alleging that canadian lumber exports to the us were unfairly subsidized and that lumber from canada was being dumped into the us market 
in response to these petitions  the us department of commerce imposed both countervailing and anti dumping duties 
canada appealed the imposition of these duties to both nafta and the wto 
on october   a definitive agreement was signed establishing a system of tiered taxes and or volume restrictions that will be in effect for a period of seven years 
generally  the agreement provides that no import restrictions would be imposed on canadian lumber shipments to the us when the published composite price for lumber is higher than per thousand board feet 
below that level  a tiered export tax would be triggered 
the impact of the taxes could be mitigated by fluctuations in the rate of exchange between us and canadian dollars 
notwithstanding the signing of a definitive agreement between the us and canadian governments  there can be no assurance that the agreement will effectively create a fair trade environment 
therefore  downward pressure on domestic timber and lumber prices caused by canadian imports could continue or increase 
comparability of financial statement periods acquisitions and divestitures 
we have pursued and expect to continue to pursue both the acquisition and divestiture of timberlands to increase the value of our assets 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located primarily in oregon 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands  located in northern michigan  arkansas and florida 
during  we acquired  acres of timberlands located in arkansas and maine 
we sold approximately  acres of timberlands in   acres in  and  acres in as a result of these timberland acquisitions and dispositions  our ownership was million acres at december   million acres at december   and million acres at december  accordingly  the comparability of periods covered by the company s financial statements is  and in the future may be  affected by the impact of timberland acquisitions and divestitures

revenues increased by million  or  to million in excluding revenues associated with our november acquisition of  acres of timberlands in michigan michigan acquisition  revenues increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million was due primarily to higher harvest levels million  offset in part by lower softwood sawlog prices million and a weaker product mix from log sales million 
harvest levels increased by approximately over the prior year s harvest levels of million tons due primarily to a temporary increase in harvest levels to take advantage of favorable log prices  especially during the first half of softwood sawlog prices during were lower than during  however  softwood sawlog prices during the fourth quarter of were lower than during the same period in the prior year 
the lower prices are primarily due to mill curtailments as a result of weak lumber and plywood prices and the significant decline in housing starts 
the weaker product mix higher percentage of pulpwood sales and lower percentage of sawlog sales is primarily due to the temporary increase in the harvesting of hardwood pulpwood stands to take advantage of favorable log prices 
excluding the impact of our michigan acquisition  operating income was of its revenues for  and for this decrease was due primarily to higher per ton log and haul rates and lower softwood sawlog prices 
segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
excluding costs and expenses associated with our michigan acquisition  costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million 
this increase of million was due primarily to higher log and haul and depletion cost million as a result of higher harvest levels and higher per ton log and haul rates million 
log and haul rates increased by approximately due to higher fuel costs and longer hauling distances

year ended december  year ended december  property acres sold revenues millions revenue per acre acres sold revenues millions revenue per acre small non strategic large non strategic conservation higher and better use recreational development properties conservation easements n a n a total revenues increased by million to million in this increase is due primarily to the sale of development properties million  the timing and location of sales of higher and better use properties million and conservation properties million  offset in part by a decrease in the sales of small non strategic properties million and no large  non strategic timberland sales during million 
the timing of real estate sales is a function of many factors  including the general state of the economy  demand in local real estate markets  the ability to obtain entitlements  the plans of adjacent landowners  our expectation of future price appreciation  the timing of harvesting activities  and the availability of government and not for profit funding 
development properties revenue increased in due primarily to the sale of a large development project for proceeds of million and the continued expansion of our real estate development business 
this large development  which the company has been working on for several years  consisted of approximately  acres of land in king county  washington 
see part i  item business  real estate segment for a summary of internal development properties and joint venture arrangements 
average price per acre for small non strategic land sales was  during compared to  per acre during compared to prices realized during  the majority of our remaining small non strategic acres will likely have a lower price per acre 
average price per acre for higher and better use recreational land sales was  during compared to  per acre during due to increased competition in several of our markets with the highest per acre prices for our higher and better use recreational properties  we may shift our sales mix to regions that tend to have lower per acre prices for our higher and better use recreational properties 
as a result  during  we expect that our higher and better use recreational properties will have a lower average price per acre 
each year we adjust our sales mix to capture value in the strongest markets 
the company employs an ongoing process designed to identify the long term best use for each of its properties to guide the investment and management decisions on each property 
currently  our million acres includes million acres of core timberlands  approximately  acres of timberlands considered to be non strategic  and million acres of timberlands with higher value for uses other than growing timber 
the non strategic timberlands generally consist of small tracts and are expected to be sold over the next five years 
the million acres with higher value are further segmented into three categories conservation  acres  recreation and higher and better use properties  acres  and those properties we expect to develop  acres through a wholly owned taxable reit subsidiary 
the higher value properties  located throughout our ownership  may be sold over approximately the next years 
the company s evaluation of the best economic use and future plans for its timberlands will change as markets for timber and alternative land uses evolve 
as these changes occur  additional core timberlands may be categorized as conservation  higher and better use  or development properties 
until these properties are sold  they will continue to be used productively in our business of growing and selling timber 
we expect revenues from real estate sales during to range between million and million from the sale of  to  acres 
we estimate these sales will consist of  to  acres of non strategic acres   to  acres of development and joint venture acres and the remainder from the sales of higher and better use and conservation acres 
the real estate segment operating income as a percent of revenue was for the period ended december   compared to for the same period in this increase was due primarily to selling a greater percentage of lower value timberlands during  including  acres of large  non strategic timberlands that were sold for a nominal gain 
real estate segment costs and expenses decreased by million to million in this decrease was due primarily to k 
table of contents selling fewer acres during million  offset in part by higher costs associated with our development business million 
costs associated with our development business were million for compared to million in  with approximately half of the development business costs in associated with the large project sold in king county  washington 
the remainder of the increase in development costs was due to higher staffing levels  basis and selling costs for lot sales  and investigatory and feasibility costs in connection with the expansion of this business 
manufactured products segment 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease was due primarily to lower lumber prices million  lower lumber sales volume million  and lower plywood sales volume million  offset in part by higher mdf prices million and higher mdf sales volume million 
lumber sales volume decreased by due primarily to production curtailments as a result of a declining log supply and weak lumber prices 
lumber prices for were lower than during  however  lumber prices during the fourth quarter of were lower than during the same period in the prior year due to the sharp decline in housing starts 
housing starts in the us during were lower compared to plywood sales volume decreased by due primarily to a declining supply of high grade plywood logs in the region and increased competition from commodity plywood mills 
plywood prices for were slightly higher than  however  plywood prices during the fourth quarter of were lower than during the fourth quarter of this price decline was due primarily to increased competition from commodity plywood producers which have targeted sales to industrial customers as a result of the slow down in home construction 
mdf prices increased an average of for all of due primarily to a mix shift to higher value products and supply constraints due to recent north america mill closures 
manufactured products segment operating income was of its revenues for and for manufactured products segment costs and expenses decreased by million  or  to million in this decrease of million was due primarily to lower lumber sales volume million and lower plywood sales volume million  offset in part by higher plywood manufacturing costs million and higher mdf raw material costs million 
plywood manufacturing costs increased due primarily to the increased costs associated with manufacturing higher value products 
mdf raw material costs increased due primarily to higher resin due to higher energy costs and wood fiber due to regional fiber shortage costs 
other costs and eliminations 
other costs and eliminations which consists of corporate overhead and intercompany profit elimination decreased operating income by million in  compared to a decrease of million in this increase of million was due primarily to increased costs associated with information technology  strategic business development  and financial and tax reporting 
other costs and eliminations increased by during and are expected to increase by another in for similar reasons 
gain from canadian lumber settlement 
in  a definitive agreement was signed between the us and canadian governments to settle the long standing dispute over canadian lumber imports 
under the terms of the agreement  approximately million of deposits collected by the us was paid to members of the us industry coalition 
as a member of the coalition  we received a pro rata share of these funds totaling million million  net of tax 
interest expense  net 
interest expense net of interest income increased million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to the issuance of million of senior notes in connection with our november michigan timberland acquisition and our repurchase of approximately million shares of common stock for million in the share repurchase was funded by using a combination of cash and debt financing 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million for compared to million for this change of million is due primarily to a remeasurement of our deferred tax liability in  which reduced tax expense for by million 
this remeasurement was related to projected sales of timberlands that are subject to built in gains tax during the ten year period ending october   that were acquired in connection with our merger with the timber company 
in addition to corporate level income tax on certain non reit activities conducted through various wholly owned taxable reit subsidiaries  the company is subject to built in gains tax on certain property dispositions as a consequence of our october  merger with the timber company 
our merger with the timber company involved merging a taxable entity into a nontaxable entity  and as a result  plum creek will generally be subject to corporate level income tax built in gains tax if the company makes a taxable disposition of certain property acquired in the merger within the ten year period following the merger date 
however  the tax is generally not payable to the extent proceeds from such dispositions are reinvested in qualifying like kind replacement property 
k 
table of contents in connection with our merger with the timber company  we wrote off all of the timber company s deferred income tax liability related to timber and timberlands except for million 
the million deferred income tax liability relates to the book tax basis difference of timber and timberlands that were expected to be sold  and subject to  the built in gains tax during the ten year period ending october  during the period october  to december   the million deferred income tax liability was reduced by million due to the payment of tax in connection with sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  we remeasure the amount of deferred income taxes needed in connection with expected sales of timberlands subject to the built in gains tax each quarterly reporting period 
in  we reduced our deferred tax liability associated with timber and timberlands by million and correspondingly recorded a deferred tax benefit of million 
based on projected timberland sales subject to the built in gains tax for the period december  to october   and our ability to successfully reinvest proceeds in like kind properties  we estimate we need a deferred tax liability of approximately million 
as a result  no adjustment to the deferred tax liability associated with built in gains tax was made in compared to northern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to higher harvest volume million and higher product prices million 
the increase in volume is due primarily to harvesting on timberlands acquired during the past several years  stronger log demand due to new mills  and an increase of harvest levels in certain markets to take advantage of favorable log prices 
revenues in included million from the harvesting of  tons associated with our acquisition of  acres of timberlands in michigan during november of sawlog prices increased by million due primarily to higher demand for logs as a result of increased lumber production and a limited supply of logs 
pulpwood prices increased by million due primarily to low log inventories 
northern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase was primarily due to higher per ton log and haul rates million and higher harvest volume 
log and haul cost on a per ton basis increased by due primarily to higher fuel costs 
segment expenses in included million as a result of our harvesting on recently acquired timberlands in michigan 
southern resources segment 
revenues increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber million  higher harvest volume million and higher softwood sawlog prices million 
revenues increased million due to the company s increased percentage of delivered log sales 
a portion of the increase in delivered log sales is by way of decreasing the percentage of standing timber sales 
under its delivered log sale agreements  the company is responsible for log and haul costs 
when standing timber is sold  the buyer incurs the log and haul costs 
the company sells logs on a delivered basis when  in management s judgment  log merchandising efforts will yield a premium over selling stumpage 
while revenues are higher when the company is responsible for the logging and hauling of timber  a large portion of that increase in revenue is to cover the related increase in cost of sales 
as a result  on delivered log sales the company realizes lower operating income as a percentage of revenue  even though operating income is generally improved 
harvest volume increased due to favorable harvesting conditions during most of and a planned increase in harvest levels 
the planned increase in harvest levels is the result of an increased percentage of maturing timber on our southern timberlands 
softwood sawlog prices increased temporarily during the first half of due primarily to a weather related shortage of logs 
several of our customers had low log inventories at the end of due to wet weather during the second half of  and as a result  offered higher prices in order to rebuild log decks 
southern resources segment operating income was of its revenues for and for southern resources segment costs and expenses increased by million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to an increase in log and haul costs as a result of a higher percentage of delivered log sales compared to sales of standing timber  increased harvesting volume  and higher fuel costs 
the per ton rate increase for log and haul costs  which increased costs and expenses by million  was due primarily to higher fuel costs

us lumber production during the first eleven months of was higher than the same period in due to start up of new mills and capacity expansions at existing mills 
furthermore  lumber imports from canada during the first eleven months of increased by over the same period in  and offshore imports europe and latin america increased by  due primarily to the strength of the us economy and weak foreign markets

during  north america structural panel production capacity has increased by approximately one billion square feet  or approximately of the annual us structural panel consumption 
during  offshore imports primarily latin america increased over amounts 
mdf prices increased due primarily to improved demand and a richer production mix
