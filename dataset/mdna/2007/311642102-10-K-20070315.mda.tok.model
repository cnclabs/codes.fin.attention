critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on our financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are our processes of recognizing revenue  the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory  income taxes  and the reserve for warranties 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and operating status 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience along with various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while for any given estimate or assumption made by the company s management there may be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable  the company believes that  given the current facts and circumstances  it is unlikely that applying any such other reasonable estimate or assumption would materially impact the financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue related to the company s measurement equipment and related software is generally recognized upon shipment as the company considers the earnings process substantially complete as of the shipping date 
revenue from sales of software only is recognized when no further significant production  modification or 
table of contents customization of the software is required and where the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales agreement exists  delivery has occurred  and the sales price is fixed or determinable and deemed collectible 
revenues resulting from sales of comprehensive support  training and technology consulting services are recognized as such services are performed 
extended maintenance plan revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the plan 
the company warrants its products against defects in design  materials and workmanship for one year 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expenses is recorded when products are shipped 
costs relating to extended maintenance plans are recognized as incurred 
revenue from the licensing agreements for the use of the company s technology for medical applications is recognized on an accrual basis based on historical data 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory since the value of inventory that will ultimately be realized cannot be known with exact certainty  we rely upon both past sales history and future sales forecasts to provide a basis for the determination of the reserve 
inventory is considered obsolete if we have withdrawn those products from the market or had no sales of the product for the past months  and have no sales forecasted for the next months 
inventory is considered excess if the quantity on hand exceeds months of remaining usage 
the resulting obsolete and excess parts are then reviewed to determine if a substitute usage or a future need exists 
items without an identified current or future usage will be reserved in an amount equal to of the fifo cost of such inventory 
our products are subject to changes in technologies that may make certain of our products or their components obsolete or less competitive  which may increase our historical provisions to the reserve 
income taxes we review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based upon expected future reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income over a two year period  and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
based on the positive and negative evidence described in financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  we establish a valuation allowance against the net deferred assets of a taxing jurisdiction in which we operate unless it is more likely than not that we will recover such assets through the above means 
in the future  our evaluation of the need for the valuation allowance will be significantly influenced by our ability to achieve profitability and our ability to predict and achieve future projections of taxable income 
the company operates in a number of different countries around the world and considers the statutory rates within each jurisdiction to determine the overall effective tax rate 
in  the company began to manufacture its products in switzerland  where it has received a favorable income tax rate commitment from the swiss government as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant there 
the aggregate dollar effect of this favorable tax rate was approximately million  or per share  in the year ended december   and million  or per share  in the year ended december  in  the company opened a regional headquarters and began to manufacture its products in singapore  where it has recently received approval for a four year tax holiday from the singapore economic development board as an incentive to establish a manufacturing plant and regional headquarters 
the aggregate dollar effect of this favorable tax rate was approximately million  or 
per share  during the year ended december  the company is subject to certain terms and conditions including employment  spending  and capital investment in each of these countries in order to receive these favorable tax rates or be subject to the statutory rates 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
we have appropriately reserved for our tax uncertainties based on the criteria established by sfas  accounting for loss contingencies 

table of contents the reserve for warranties the company establishes at the time of sale a liability for the one year warranty included with the initial purchase price of the equipment based upon an estimate of the repair expenses likely to be incurred for the warranty period 
the warranty period is measured in installation months for each major product group 
warranty reserve is reflected in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the warranty expense is estimated by applying the actual total repair expenses for each product group in the prior period and determining a rate of repair expense per installation month 
this repair rate is multiplied by the number of installation months of warranty for each product group to determine the provision for warranty expenses for the period 
the company evaluates its exposure to warranty costs at the end of each period using the estimated expense per installation month for each major product group  the number of units remaining under warranty and the remaining number of months each unit will be under warranty 
the company has a history of new product introductions and enhancements to existing products which may result in unforeseen issues that may increase our warranty costs 
while such expenses have historically been within expectations  we cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
transactions with related and other parties the company leases its headquarters in lake mary  florida from xenon research  inc  a company owned by simon raab  the company s chairman  and diana raab  his spouse 
the prior lease expired on february   and the company executed a new lease agreement on august  with xenon research 
the initial term of the lease commenced as of july  and expires on july  the lease will be automatically renewed for one successive five year term unless the company provides xenon research with written notice of non renewal at least days prior to the end of the then applicable term 
the company also has a one time right to terminate the lease after three years from july  upon written notice delivered to the landlord one year prior to the date upon which the company wishes to terminate the lease 
the company s independent directors negotiated and approved the lease on behalf of the company 
in that process  the independent directors consulted with a real estate broker to verify that the lease rate and terms were competitive and at market 
during the first year of the initial term  the fixed rent will be  per annum payable monthly 
each year thereafter on july  the fixed rent will be increased by three percent over the fixed rent for the preceding year 
the lease is a net lease  meaning that the company also is responsible for real estate taxes and insurance expenses covering the leased premises 
the real estate taxes and insurance expenses are paid by xenon research  and the company reimburses xenon research in equal monthly payments for such real estate taxes and insurance expenses with the reimbursement amount to be computed annually based on the real estate taxes and insurance expenses actually paid by xenon research 
all payments of fixed rent and additional rent will include all applicable sales and use taxes 
foreign exchange exposure we conduct a significant portion of our business outside the united states 
at present  approximately of our revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of our operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of our operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of our non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases or decreases in the future  our exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates may increase or decrease in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our critical accounting policies for purposes of explaining the methodology used in the calculation in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the possible effects on our financial condition 
the critical policies discussed below are our processes of recognizing revenue  the reserve for obsolescence  income taxes  and the reserve for warranties 
these policies affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing our financial and operating status 
these policies involve certain assumptions that  if incorrect  could create an adverse impact on our operations and financial position

 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter sfas no 
retains the general principle of arb no 
 chapter  inventory pricing  that inventories are presumed to be stated at cost  however  it amends arb no 
to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facilities  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be recognized as current period expenses 
also  sfas no 
requires fixed overhead costs be allocated to inventories based on normal production capacity 
the guidance in safs no 
is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires employee stock options and rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans to be accounted for under the fair value method  and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no 
 as allowed under the original provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires the use of an option pricing model for estimating fair value  which is amortized to expense over the service periods 
sfas no 
r allows for two alternative transition methods 
the first method is the modified prospective application whereby compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date will be recognized over the remaining service period 
the compensation cost for that portion of awards will be based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 as originally issued 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date will be accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
the second method is the modified retrospective application  which requires that the company restates prior period financial statements 
the modified retrospective application may be applied either to all periods or only to prior interim periods in the year of adoption of this statement 
the company has adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r effective january  using the modified prospective application transition method 
the company accelerated the vesting for substantially all of its outstanding options prior to december   and expects to record minimal expenses for its remaining unvested stock options during the reduction in pre tax charges estimated by the company as a result of the acceleration amounts to approximately million over the course of the original vesting periods 
the fair value for any future grants will be included in expense over the vesting periods 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements 
these methods are referred to as the roll over and iron curtain method 
the roll over method quantifies the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated 
exclusive reliance on an income statement approach can result in the accumulation of errors on the balance sheet that may not have been material to any individual income statement  but which may misstate one or more balance sheet accounts 
the iron curtain method quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
exclusive reliance on a balance sheet approach can result in disregarding the effects of errors in the current year income statement that results from the correction of an error existing in previously issued financial statements 
we previously used the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 

table of contents sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
sab allows registrants to initially apply the dual approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings
