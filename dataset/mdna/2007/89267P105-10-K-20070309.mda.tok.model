industry background active trader market an active trader has been defined by celent communications in a may research report as one who trades on average at least times per month  or times per year 
celent believes there are approximately  active traders under that definition 
celent also defined a broader active trader market  which includes all who trade  on average  at least times per year  and estimates that broader market to include  to  traders 
that research report also offers an estimate of  individuals who trade between and  times per year  and of  individuals who trade  times or more a year 
similarly  a november research report by fox pitt  kelton characterized active traders as those who tend to trade from to times a month  with account balances in the  to  range  and who utilize margin to some degree in their trading 
celent s may report estimated that the top of all online brokerage accounts celent estimated there to be million online brokerage accounts in  of which equals million accounts make up of all trading and margin revenue for retail brokerage firms serving the active trader market 
the most active traders  the  or so who  celent estimates  trade at least  times a year  are often called semi professional or hyper active traders 
these traders are generally considered to be the most profitable portion of the active trader market 
bear  stearns co  in a january equity research report  defined the semi professional market as one whose participants trade  on average  nearly times per day roughly  trades per trader  per year  and estimated the size of that market at the end of to be approximately  traders 
according to the bear stearns report  those  or so semi professional traders made up  in  an estimated of total nyse and nasdaq daily share volume and an estimated of total online trade volume 
the bear stearns report emphasized the importance to this market of multiple asset classes  stating that today  we believe that the biggest focus is on trading multiple asset classes from a single  yet global  platform  and that traders are demanding trading platforms that are capable of connecting them to the cash equities markets  the futures markets  the options markets  and the foreign exchange fx markets  among others 
the november fox pitt  kelton report added that semi professional traders use highly sophisticated software  often engage with higher stakes  and are much more likely to utilize strategies across asset classes beyond just equities and equity options  such as futures and forex  with trading on margin being prevalent 
richard bove  a research analyst for punk ziegel company  goes even further in his january  research report  suggesting that the trading of common stock cash equities is no longer a growth business and that the industry is seeking to diversify outside of the equity markets 
it is worth noting that all of the above mentioned statistics appear to relate solely to equities accounts and equities trade volume  meaning that the futures and forex online trader markets  which are a fraction of the size of the online equities market but are growing  are in addition to the estimates described above 

table of contents the vast majority of active traders are believed to be with traditional online brokerage firms eg  e trade  fidelity  schwab and td ameritrade 
it is generally accepted in the online brokerage industry that to of each large online brokerage firm s customer base consists of active traders  and that those active traders are responsible for the vast majority of those firms trades 
accordingly  nearly all of the large online brokerage firms have tried over recent years to acquire direct access firms or technology  and more sophisticated trading analysis platforms  in order to retain and grow this most valuable segment of their customer bases 
we believe an online brokerage firm focused on active traders  in order to maximize its potential for successful market penetration  needs to deliver fast electronic order placement and execution  including both automated and one click manual order placement capabilities state of the art advanced orders capabilities the ability to use various order placement features limits  trailing stops  simultaneous orders  contingency orders  reserve orders  hidden orders  pegged orders  discretionary orders  etc 
intelligent smart order routing to maximize liquidity and help achieve best execution the ability to analyze and trade multiple asset classes equities  equity options  futures and forex using the same platform access to most  if not all  major avenues of execution the major ecns  nasdaq market center  superdot  globex  ecbot  the major electronic options exchanges  etc 
strategy testing and strategy automation capabilities  as well as advanced charting and analysis software tools competitive commission pricing structures for equities  equity options  futures and forex streaming  real time quotes  including meaningful market depth displays trade desk  customer account and technical support services customer training services tradestation securities offers each of the above mentioned features 
institutional trader market we see the institutional trader market  as it relates to potential customer relationships for direct market access brokerage firms like tradestation securities  as hedge fund and money managers  commodity trading advisors and commodity pool operators  and registered investment advisers who use short term trading strategies 
according to recent estimates  there are approximately  hedge funds today  which are estimated to manage up to trillion of invested assets  and  registered investment advisers  which are estimated to manage more than trillion of invested assets 
also  of the largest hedge fund complexes  those with over billion in assets  a majority have funds or commodity pools sponsored  operated or advised by cftc registered commodity trading advisors and or commodity pool operators 
the cftc recently reported that there are approximately  commodity pools and more than  registered commodity pool operators 
many believe that buy side institutional traders have become less and less pleased with wall street traditional sell side brokerage firms and are moving  to one degree or another  towards using direct market access execution of their trading decisions 
the january bear stearns report states that the impact of financial technology on the securities markets cannot be understated  noting that the technologies originally developed to give the day trader the ability to trade with professionals is now  ironically  being targeted at institutional customers by most brokerage firms 
according to an april report by the tabb group  institutional buy side traders now have access to powerful technologies to better understand  manage  and execute trades faster  more efficiently  less expensively  and more effectively than at any point in the past  and that these technologies offer capabilities which automatically execute large orders in accordance with a chosen trading strategy 

table of contents features and services that are important to many buy side institutional traders include sophisticated decision support front ends that enable analysis and development of sophisticated rule based trading strategies  automated strategy trading  intuitive order placement  advanced portfolio basket trading  multiple account trade allocation  a detailed  flexible order management portfolio management system or the ability to integrate with their management systems  and a broad scope of assets equities  equity options  futures and forex that can be analyzed and traded using the same platform 
tradestation contains decision support and automated trading and manual order placement functionality  list basket trading  multiple account trade allocation  and state of the art direct access execution services for equities  equity options and futures trading and soon for forex trading  and continues to work on more advanced portfolio basket trading features and new order and risk management system compatibilities and features 
products and services overview tradestation our main product service offering is the tradestation electronic trading platform  complete with electronic order execution services  for self directed  active  including semi professional  traders and certain segments of the institutional buy side trader market 
tradestation does not provide investment or trading advice or recommendations  or recommend the use of any particular strategy  but rather enables the trader to design  test  optimize and automate his own  custom trading strategies 
tradestation is a registered trademark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan 
in addition to offering the tradestation electronic trading platform to the brokerage customers of our tradestation securities subsidiary  we offer  through our tradestation technologies subsidiary  tradestation subscriptions 
the difference between the tradestation electronic trading platform and the tradestation subscription service is that the subscription service does not include order execution or account management capabilities 
tradestation has  since its initial release as a strategy trading software program in  been our flagship product 
from until october it was marketed worldwide to institutional traders on a monthly subscription basis by telerate  inc as a premium tool for the telerate data feed service 
it has also served  and continues to serve  as a strategy trading platform for numerous third party trading software applications 
its state of the art technology empowers the trader to design and develop a rule based trading strategy based upon the trader s objective rules and criteria  test the potential profitability of that trading strategy against historical data  and then computer automate it to monitor the applicable market and alert the trader in real time or instantaneously place the trade order when the criteria of the trading strategy have been met and an order should  therefore  be placed 
the principal features of tradestation that enable the trader to design and develop trading strategies are easylanguage and the powereditor 
easylanguage is a proprietary computer language we developed consisting of english like statements and trading terms which can be input by the trader to describe particular objective rules and criteria 
the powereditor is a compiler of easylanguage statements that provides the trader with considerable flexibility to modify and combine different trading rules and criteria  which ultimately result in the design of the trader s trading strategies 
easylanguage and powereditor are also registered trademarks 

table of contents brokerage services tradestation securities principal offering today is online brokerage services  covering equities principally stocks and etfs  equity options  futures including futures options and forex transactions  through the tradestation electronic trading platform 
equities  equity options and futures are all direct market access offerings  and a direct market access offering for forex is expected to be launched later this year 
tradestation securities targeted customer base for brokerage services includes active  including semi professional  traders and certain institutional traders  such as hedge fund and money managers and investment advisors who use short term trading strategies 
in addition to providing online services through the tradestation electronic trading platform  the brokerage firm offers personal support services by its registered trade desk representatives who execute customers orders through direct access order execution systems if the customer is for some reason unable or unwilling to place the order using his or her own computer 
having a direct access order execution system  whether accessed directly by the brokerage customer through the tradestation electronic trading platform or by a tradestation securities broker on behalf of the brokerage customer  means that both the online services and the firm s trading desks are directly connected to electronic equities  equity options and futures market centers 
this system often results in the simplest  most direct and speediest execution of orders at the best available price 
with respect to pit traded futures contracts  tradestation is directly connected to its futures clearing agent s online execution system  which sends the order directly to the trading pit 
approximately of the company s futures trades are on the electronic futures exchanges 
with respect to forex deals  the tradestation electronic trading platform is currently directly connected to a third party forex dealer s online deal system  which then electronically places the forex orders  but the company plans to launch a direct access forex offering later this year 
tradestation securities self clears for its active trader equity securities accounts 
institutional accounts for equity securities and futures are carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s clearing agents or are given order execution services on a delivery vs 
payment receipt vs 
payment dvp rvp basis for equities  or a give up basis for futures  in either case with the orders cleared and settled by the client s prime brokerage firm 
all individual futures accounts are carried on a fully disclosed basis by the brokerage s futures clearing agent 
tradestation securities executes its customers securities and futures transactions on an agency basis only  as opposed to a principal basis 
that is  it acts as the agent for its customers directly in the market 
when brokerage firms perform transactions on a principal basis  they are permitted to accept a customer s order to purchase  purchase the securities in the market for the brokerage firm  and then sell the securities to the customer 
tradestation securities does not do this 
it always charges only an agreed upon commission and never earns income from marking up or marking down its customers securities or futures transactions 
for forex deals  an unaffiliated forex dealer firm acts as principal counterparty for  and clears  all deals with the company s forex customers 
software products and services in december  we launched the tradestation electronic subscription service

sales and marketing our marketing in consisted principally of print advertising in active trader  futures  sfo  and technical analysis of stocks commodities magazines  direct mail and e mail  sales seminars  and our web sites  and television advertising on financial news channels 
the mix and frequency of television  print  web site  direct mail and in person marketing methods that we use to try to achieve results will likely be continually modified as we test such methods and mixtures and analyze and interpret the results 
revenues derived from customers outside of the united states for the years ended december   and  were approximately  less than and approximately  respectively 
international revenues are collected in us dollars 
we conduct no marketing  sales or other operations  and maintain no assets  outside of the united states  other than relating to our start up operations in london via our united kingdom subsidiary  tradestation europe limited

technology development we believe that our success depends  in large part  on our ability to offer unique  internet based trading technologies with state of the art order execution technologies  and continuously enhance those technologies  as well as develop and implement well designed and user friendly web sites 
to date  we have relied primarily on internal development of our products and services 
we 
table of contents currently perform all quality assurance and develop user education and other training materials internally 
in  and  technology development expenses were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
as of december   our technology development team was comprised of people  as compared to as of december   a increase 
we view our technology development cycle as a four step process to achieve technological feasibility 
the first step is to conceptualize in detail the defining features and functions that we believe our targeted market requires from the product or service  and to undertake a cost benefit analysis to determine the proper scope and integration of such features and functions 
once the functional requirements of the product or service have been determined  the second step is to technically design the product or service 
the third step is the detailed implementation  or engineering  of this technical design 
the fourth step is rigorous quality assurance testing to ensure that the final product or service generally meets the functional requirements determined in the first step 
several refinements are typically added and tested in the quality assurance phase of development 
once this process is completed  technological feasibility has been achieved and the working model is available for release to our customers 
the market for strategy trading software tools  streaming real time market data and news services  and online order execution services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards in computer hardware  programming tools and languages  operating systems  database technology and information delivery systems  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements  as well as technical consolidation of products and services 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to develop and maintain competitive technologies and to develop and introduce new products  services and enhancements in a timely and cost effective manner that meets changing conditions such as evolving customer needs  existing and new competitive product and service offerings  emerging industry standards  changing technology  and increased capacity and stability requirements as we grow our business and as minimum customer acceptability standards for capacity and stability increase in our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to develop  introduce and market  on a timely basis  if at all  products  services or enhancements that respond to changing market conditions or that will be accepted by customers 
any failure by us to anticipate or to respond quickly to changing market conditions  or any significant delays in the introduction of new products and services or enhancements  could cause customers to delay using  or decide against the use of  our products and services and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
customer services and support and training we provide customer services and support and product use training in the following ways customer services and support 
telephone account and technical support service is provided to brokerage customers through a trained customer service team 
advanced easylanguage consulting services services that technically assist customers in the use of easylanguage to write the customers own trading strategies are available from internal resources and from unaffiliated  independent easylanguage consultants 
a substantial amount of technical support information is also provided on our web sites 
product use training 
we consider user education important to try to help our customers increase their abilities to use our products and services fully and effectively 
the majority of our training materials consist of extensive online documentation and technical assistance information on our web sites  including online tutorials  as well as in person training seminars  so that our 
table of contents customers may learn to use and take full advantage of the sophisticated technology of the tradestation electronic trading platform 
the tradestation 
com support center includes access to an interactive community for active traders who engage or have interest in the development  testing and use of objective trading strategies 
the community provides numerous discussion forums on a variety of topics related to strategy development and technical trading  as well as tradestation product and service features  articles about trading from industry leaders  and a library of strategy indicators  rules and components written in our proprietary easylanguage  many of which are donated by third parties 
competition the market for online brokerage services is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there appears to be substantial consolidation in the industry in three different ways 
first  there has been over the past several years and continues to be consolidation of three types of services that traditionally were offered separately online brokerage services  real time market data services  and trading analysis software products and services 
with the tradestation electronic trading platform  we have embraced this consolidation by offering all three of these services in a fully integrated  seamless manner 
second  we believe consolidation is occurring in the four major online execution markets for active traders equities  equity options  futures and forex meaning that  contrary to specializing in offering services for only one of those market instruments  more and more firms are offering or plan to offer three or four of those services 
with our offering of online trading services for all four of these markets  we have embraced this consolidation as well 
third  as a result of price pressure  unused infrastructure capacity at the largest online brokerage firms  and the desire of the larger firms to acquire sophisticated electronic trading technologies  there have been numerous acquisitions in our industry  mostly by larger firms that are seeking to increase their ability to compete on both quality and price 
we believe that competition  as well as consolidation  will continue to increase and intensify in the future 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control  including price pressure  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by us and our competitors  our ability to design and support efficient  materially error free internet based systems  market conditions  such as recession and volatility  the size of the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use electronic brokerage services offered by firms that have traditionally served mostly retail customers  product and service functionality  data availability and cost  clearing costs  ease of use  reliability  customer service and support  and sales and marketing decisions and efforts 
we face direct competition from several publicly traded and privately held companies  principally online brokerages and futures commission merchants  including providers of direct access order execution services 
our competitors include the many online brokerages currently active in the united states  some of which offer both equities and futures brokerage services  including banc of america investment services  charles schwab co 
including cybertrader  e trade securities  fidelity brokerage services  interactive brokers  merrill lynch direct  optionsxpress  redi products a division of spear  leeds kellogg which is owned by goldman sachs  scottrade financial services  td ameritrade  and townsend analytics which is owned by lehman brothers 
those brokers currently serve  in the aggregate  more than of existing online accounts  and many are focused on attracting and retaining active traders 
many online brokerages currently claim to offer direct access service 
even though we are rated as one of the 
table of contents best online brokerage firms in the united states  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such ratings  be rated that highly in the future  compete effectively with our competitors  adequately educate potential customers about the benefits our products and services provide  or continue to offer such products and services 
many of our existing and potential competitors  which include large  online discount and traditional national brokerages and futures commission merchants  and financial institutions that are focusing more closely on online services  including electronic trading services for active traders  have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources  greater name recognition and a larger installed customer base than do we 
further  there is the risk that larger financial institutions which offer online brokerage services as only one of many financial services may decide to use extremely low commission pricing or free trades as a loss leader to acquire and accumulate customer accounts and assets to derive interest income and income from their other financial services 
we do not offer other financial services  and have no plans to do so  therefore  such pricing techniques  should they become common in our industry  could have a material  adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and business model 
generally  competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
there can be no assurance that our existing or potential competitors will not develop products and services comparable or superior to those developed and offered by us or adapt more quickly to new technologies  evolving industry trends or changing customer requirements  or that we will be able to timely and adequately complete the implementation  and appropriately maintain and enhance the operation  of our business model 
recently  some of our larger competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule based or strategy trading products and features to the active trader market  including comparison advertisements with our active trader offering 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins  failure to obtain any significant market share  or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property our success is and will be heavily dependent on proprietary software technology  including certain technology currently in development 
we view our software technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we also have formal patent applications pending for the tradestation trading platform  and own a patent that covers product features that have recently been incorporated into tradestation 
with respect to the pending patent applications  there can be no assurance that we will obtain patents broad enough in scope to have value  or obtain them at all 
we also have registered copyright rights in our easylanguage dictionary and documentation and tradestation software 
we have obtained trademark registrations for the tradestation mark in the united states  australia  canada  the european union  indonesia  korea  singapore  south africa and taiwan 
we have obtained registrations for the optionstation mark in the united states  canada and the european union 
we have obtained registrations for the easylanguage mark in the united states and the european union

since these licenses are not physically signed by the licensees  it is possible their enforceability is limited under certain state laws and the laws of many foreign jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties copy or otherwise obtain  use or exploit our software or technology independently 
policing unauthorized use of our software technology is difficult  and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software technology exists 
piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in certain countries  including some in which we may attempt to expand sales efforts 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to ours 
there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
we do not believe that we are infringing  or that any technology in development will infringe  the intellectual property rights of others 
however  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted by our competitors or others  and  if asserted  there can be no assurance that they would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that we acquire or license a portion of the software or data included in our products or services from third parties some data and software are licensed from third parties  or market products licensed from others generally  our exposure to infringement actions may increase because we must rely upon such third parties for information as to the origin and ownership of such acquired or licensed software or data technology 
software patent infringement cases in financial service industries are becoming more frequent  and we may be subject to litigation to defend against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the intellectual property rights of others 
in the future  litigation will likely be necessary to establish  define  enforce  defend and protect patents  trade secrets  copyrights  trademarks and other intellectual property rights 
any such litigation would likely be costly and divert management s attention  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
adverse determinations in such litigation could result in the loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  which could be expensive  or prevent us from selling our products or services or using our trademarks  any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation our brokerage subsidiary  tradestation securities  is subject to extensive securities and futures industry regulation under both federal and state laws as a broker dealer with respect to its equities and equity options business and as a futures commission merchant with respect to its futures and forex business 
broker dealers and futures commission merchants are subject to regulations covering all 
table of contents aspects of those businesses  including sales methods  trade practices  use and safe keeping of customers funds and securities  clearing  processing and settlement of trades  and arrangements with clearing houses  exchanges and clearing corporations  capital structure  cash deposit or escrow requirements or their equivalent  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision 
to the extent tradestation securities solicits orders from customers or makes investment recommendations  it is subject to additional rules and regulations governing  among other things  sales practices and the suitability of recommendations to its customers 
tradestation securities mode of operation and profitability may be directly affected by additional legislation  changes in rules promulgated by the sec  nasd  nyse  cftc  nfa  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  dtcc  occ  various securities and futures exchanges  and other self regulatory associations and organizations  and changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing rules and laws  particularly any changes focused on online brokerages that target an active trader customer base 
with respect to active trading  the nasd has adopted rules that require firms to provide customers with a risk disclosure statement about active trading 
further  the nasd and nyse s margin rules impose more restrictive requirements for pattern active traders 
governmental concern is focused in two basic areas that the customer has sufficient trading experience and that the customer has sufficient risk capital to engage in active trading 
a minimum equities account balance of  is required 
tradestation securities customer account documentation specifies that being a brokerage customer of tradestation securities is only for traders who have experience in active trading  are willing to risk considerable amounts of capital at least  and are interested in engaging in high risk  short term  speculative trading activity 
we believe our brokerage firm s minimum account opening requirements  as well as the extensive user education documentation and tutorials offered on our web site  are consistent with both the letter and the spirit of current rules and regulations concerning active trading 
tradestation europe limited  which was formed to introduce brokerage customers from the european union to tradestation securities  is authorized and regulated by the fsa  and  in using its european passport to conduct such business throughout the european union  is subject to the marketing  solicitation and other customer protection rules in effect in each european union country in which it conducts such business

marketing campaigns by tradestation securities to bring brand name recognition to its services and to promote the benefit of those services  such as the tradestation electronic trading platform and its various features  are regulated by the nasd and nfa  and all marketing materials must be reviewed by an appropriately licensed tradestation securities principal prior to release  and must conform to standards articulated by the sec  nasd and nfa 
the nasd or nfa may request that revisions be made to marketing materials  and can impose certain penalties for violations of its advertising regulations  including censures or fines  a requirement of advance regulatory approval of all advertising  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a broker dealer or futures commission merchant or any of its officers or employees 

table of contents the sec  nasd  nyse  cftc  nfa  dtcc and occ and various other regulatory associations and organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital or cash deposit requirements and reserves by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants 
net capital is the net worth of the regulated company assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it must cease conducting business and  if it does not do so  it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or the cftc and suspension or expulsion by the nasd  nyse or nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation

tradestation securities is a member of the sipc 
sipc provides protection of up to  for each securities account brokerage customer  subject to a limitation of  for cash balances  in the event of the financial failure of a broker dealer 
for securities brokerage accounts the custody and trade clearing of and for which are handled by tradestation securities  an excess securities bond through hsbc insurance brokerage limited  as agent of lloyd s of london  provides protection for any loss of securities and or cash in excess of primary sipc protection  up to million in the aggregate and up to million per any one account 
based upon the asset size per account and in the aggregate of tradestation securities securities account customer base as of the date of this report  this excess sipc protection  combined with primary sipc protection  should be more than adequate to cover the loss of of those customer assets in the very unlikely event that tradestation securities experienced financial failure and all customer assets were somehow lost 
to the extent tradestation securities clears its securities brokerage transactions through bear  stearns securities corp 
which  currently  it does only for institutional accounts  bear  stearns has obtained an excess securities bond that provides protection for any loss of securities and or cash in excess of the primary sipc protection 
neither sipc nor excess sipc coverage applies to fluctuations in the market value of securities or any losses other than those directly caused by the financial failure of the broker dealer  or to futures or forex accounts 
it is possible that other federal or state agencies will attempt to regulate our current and planned online and other electronic service activities with rules that may include compliance requirements relating to record keeping  data processing  other operation methods  privacy  pricing  content  and quality of goods and services as the market for online commerce evolves 
given the continuing growth of the electronic commerce market  federal or state authorities may enact additional laws  rules or regulations  not only with respect to online brokerage services  but to other online services we provide or may in the future provide 
such laws  rules and regulations  if and when enacted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects

risk factors the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this report  as well as the preceding business section of this report  should be read and evaluated together with the issues  uncertainties and risk factors relating to our business described below 
while we have been and continue to be confident in our business and business prospects  we believe it is very important that anyone who reads this report consider these issues  uncertainties and risk factors  which include business risks relevant both to our industry and to us in particular 
these issues  uncertainties and risk factors are not intended to be exclusive 
issues  uncertainties and risk factors are also included in other sections of this report when specifically relevant to a statement we have made about an aspect of our business  or our financial condition or results of operations 
this report also contains statements that are forward looking within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

table of contents all forward looking statements are based on current expectations and beliefs concerning future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties  including the risks and uncertainties described below and elsewhere in this report 
actual results may differ materially from the results suggested in this report 
factors that may cause or contribute to such differences  and our business risks and uncertainties generally  include  but are not limited to  the items described below  as well as those described in other sections of this report  our other public filings and our press releases 
there are several factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which could result in significant volatility in our stock price quarterly revenues and operating results of tradestation group have fluctuated significantly in the past  and our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future 
causes of such significant fluctuations may include  but are not limited to general economic and market factors that affect active trading and brokerage revenues  including trade volume  market volatility  market direction or trends  the level of confidence and trust in the markets  and seasonality summer months and holiday seasons typically being slower periods  and changes in interest rates a significant and growing portion of our revenues is interest income  and increases or decreases in short term rates may have a material impact on our revenues and net income  market or competitive pressure to lower commissions and fees charged to customers our competitors continue to reduce their online brokerage commissions and we have recently announced a reduction in our futures commission pricing  or to reduce or eliminate monthly platform fees paid by brokerage customers we have recently  on more than one occasion  materially reduced the trading activity thresholds our brokerage clients need to meet to qualify for a waiver of monthly platform fees  or to reduce interest rates charged to customers for margin loans or to increase the interest rates used to credit customers account cash balances  the quality and success of  and potential continuous changes in  sales or marketing strategies which continue to evolve  including the effects of our recent decisions to change the structure of  and reduce  our futures commission pricing and to lower materially the trade activity thresholds that need to be met for a brokerage customer s monthly platform fee to be waived  technical difficulties  errors and or failures in our electronic and software products  services and systems relating to market data  order execution and trade processing and reporting  and other software or system errors and failures there have been several market data and order execution outages recently  the causes of which we have been working to correct  as well as failures to perform on the part of the brokerage firm s back office system vendor  any of which could result in a business or legal requirement to issue large credit amounts to customers  loss of accounts  reduced trading activity  loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry  increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources  regulatory inquiries  fines and sanctions  and other material adverse consequences also  we do not maintain a seamless  redundant back up system to our order execution systems  which could materially intensify the negative consequences described above  
table of contents pending or potential third party claims or regulatory matters that turn out to be significantly more costly  in terms of both judgment or settlement amounts and legal expenses or the refusal or failure of our insurer to make payments  or fines  than we currently estimate or expect  including  but not necessarily limited to  the two remaining claims filed in by the co founders of the predecessor company to tradestation securities against the company  certain of its executive officers and directors and certain family partnerships owned by the two former co chief executive officers which seek  in the aggregate  tens of millions of dollars in damages  and pending issues relating to nasd oats reporting  nyse ots reporting  and nasd short sale procedures  acquisitions of businesses  assets  accounts or similar transactions relating to company growth or strategies  which may significantly impact future financial results  our balance sheet and our cash position depending upon the type and size of any such transaction  variations from our expectations with respect to hiring and retention of personnel  sales and marketing expenditures  product development  customer account growth  customer trading activity and the share volume of customer trades  or other revenue or expense items  the ability to collect unsecured accounts receivable that may arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business or otherwise  the timing and success of our planned launch of a seamless forex trading platform  the success or lack thereof of the company s new product feature that enables the design  testing and automation of fundamental data strategies  costs  material shifts in cash requirements and or adverse financial consequences that may occur with respect to clearing organization  clearing agent and or exchange requirements  or regulatory issues  including exchange  clearing agent or clearing organization cash deposit requirements  reserve and settlement requirements and other financial requirements  if revenues are lower than budgeted expectations as a result of lower than expected share volume  brokerage accounts  assets per equity account or daily average trades or other reasons  the negative effects of such lower revenues to our bottom line  including our inability to make in a timely fashion commensurate expense reductions as a large amount of our expenses do not vary with revenues in the short term  changes in demand for our products and services due to the rapid pace at which new technology is offered to customers in our industry  the size and frequency of any trading errors or unsecured brokerage account debit balances for which we may ultimately suffer the economic burden  in whole or in part including losses from third party claims that may arise from time to time since june   we have not carried errors or omissions insurance for third party claims  the appeal of our products and services to the forex and institutional markets given our limited experience selling to those markets  and the cost of technology development and sales  marketing  compliance  technical  administrative and other infrastructure that may be required to improve our chances of success in those markets  
table of contents the appeal of our products and services to markets outside of the united states principally europe  given our lack of experience selling to markets outside of the united states  our success or lack of success in developing or enhancing products or services that may be more attractive to non us traders  and the costs  including sales  marketing  compliance  administrative and development  that may be required to improve our chances of success in those markets  and the effect of any decision to suspend or terminate the company s current share buy back plan 
conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity  and level of interest income our products and services are  and will continue to be  designed for customers who trade actively in the securities and financial markets 
to the extent that interest in active trading  or trading generally  decreases due to low trading volumes  lack of volatility  significant downward movement in the securities or financial markets  or negative market sentiment  or future tax law changes  recessions  depressions  wars  terrorism including cyberterrorism  or otherwise  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially  adversely affected 
unfavorable market conditions have  historically  seemed to severely negatively impact the share price of publicly held online brokerage firms  and also usually result in more losses for our customers  which could result in increases in quantity and size of errors or omissions or other claims that may be made against us by customers 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of those potential claims 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
also  we derive a significant portion of our brokerage revenues from interest income on customers credit balances and account borrowings 
therefore  changes in interest rates or in the size of such balances and borrowings  depending upon the extent of the change  could materially change  positively or negatively depending upon the direction of the change the amount of our interest income 
our industry is intensely competitive  which makes it difficult to attract and retain customers the markets for online brokerage services  trading software tools  and real time market data services are intensely competitive and rapidly evolving  and there has been substantial consolidation of those three products and services in the industry  as well as consolidation of the types of financial instruments equities  equity options  futures  forex offered by firms 
there has also been consolidation of online brokerage firms generally  as well as intense price competition 
we believe that competition from large online and other large brokerage firms and smaller brokerage firms focused on active traders  as well as consolidation  will continue 
recently  some of our larger competitors have been adding or emphasizing rule based or strategy trading products and features to the active trader market  including comparison advertisements with our active trader offering 
competition may be further intensified by the size of the active trader market  which is generally thought to be comprised of less than of all online brokerage accounts 
we believe our ability to compete will depend upon many factors both within and outside our control 
factors outside of our control include price pressure on transactional commissions  monthly platform fees and interest rates offered to customers for both credit balances and account borrowings  the timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements developed by our competitors including strategy back testing and automation capabilities  market conditions  such as recession  the size of 
table of contents the active trader market today and in the future  the extent to which institutional traders are willing to use electronic brokerage services from firms that have traditionally served mostly retail customers  data availability and cost  and exchange and third party clearing costs 
factors over which we have more control  but which are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties with respect to our ability to effectively compete  include timing and market acceptance of new products and services and enhancements we develop  our ability to meet changing market demands for a unified  integrated trading platform that offers customers the ability to trade and manage portfolios containing multiple asset classes  our ability to design  improve and support materially error free and sufficiently robust internet based systems  ease of use of our products and services  reliability of our products and services  and pricing decisions and other sales and marketing decisions and efforts we have recently reduced futures commission pricing and our monthly platform fee waiver thresholds 
systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers the online electronic trading platform we provide to our customers is based upon the integration of our sophisticated front end software technology with our equally sophisticated  internet based server farm technology 
our server farm technology is the foundation upon which online trading customers receive real time market data and place buy and sell orders 
however  in order for this technology to provide a live  real time trading platform  it requires integration with real time market data  which are currently provided directly by the exchanges or by systems of independent third party market data vendors who obtain the data directly from the exchanges  the electronic order book systems of ecns and electronic systems offered by the exchanges  the clearing and back office systems we license from sungard for self clearing and of the clearing agents we use for trades that we do not self clear  and the forex deal order placement  settlement and back office systems of or licensed to the forex dealer firm which is responsible for all of our customers forex trades 
accordingly  our ability to offer a platform that enables the development  testing and automation of trading strategies and the placement  execution  clearing and settlement of buy and sell orders depends heavily on the effectiveness  integrity  reliability and consistent performance of all of these systems and technologies 
in particular  the stress that is placed on these systems during peak trading times could cause one or more of these systems to operate too slowly or fail 
outages and other system failures may also be caused by natural disasters and other events and circumstances beyond our control 
we have experienced several delays and outages since we launched our online trading platform  many of which related to data vendor  clearing agent  exchange and ecn outages or issues which are beyond our control 
there have also been several market data and order execution outages recently  as well as failures to perform on the part of the brokerage firm s back office system vendor 
any major system failure or outage or series of frequent failures or outages  regardless of the cause  could result in a business or legal requirement to issue large credit amounts to customers  loss of accounts  reduced trading activity  loss of or diminished reputation and recognition in the industry  increased monetary costs and diversion of internal resources  regulatory inquiries  fines and sanctions  and other material adverse consequences 
also  we do not maintain a seamless  redundant back up system to our order execution systems  which could materially intensify these negative consequences 
additionally  as a general matter not applicable only to our company  the integrity of these types of systems may be attacked by persons sometimes referred to as hackers who intentionally introduce viruses or other defects to cause damage  inaccuracies or complete failure 
also  cyberterrorism  should it occur  may significantly affect people s willingness to use internet based services  particularly ones that involve their personal or company s assets 

table of contents during a system outage or failure  our brokerage may be able to take orders by telephone  however  only associates with appropriate licenses  knowledge and experience can accept telephone orders  and an adequate number of associates likely would not be available to take customer calls in the event of a system outage or failure 
system delays  errors  outages and failures  depending upon how serious and how often they occur  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers below 
the loss of key employees could decrease the quality of our management and operations most recently  the company s co founders  co chairmen and co ceos have announced they are transitioning out of their day to day roles and will no longer serve as executive officers our success depends to a very significant extent on the continued availability and performance of a number of senior management and product development personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our company 
in particular there may be adverse consequences to the company and or its operations as a result of the recent change in company senior management roles  which included the transition of william and ralph cruz  the company s co founders and co chairmen  out of their day to day senior management roles as co ceos 
the causes of potential adverse consequences may include changes in management styles or decisions that produce less favorable results than would have been produced under the prior management structure 
we are exposed to credit risk we make margin loans to clients collateralized by client securities  and borrow securities to cover trades 
in fact  nearly all of our clients accounts are margin  as opposed to cash  brokerage accounts 
a portion of our net revenues is derived from interest on margin loans 
to the extent that these margin loans exceed client cash balances maintained with us  we must obtain financing from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain this financing on favorable terms or in sufficient amounts 
by permitting clients to purchase securities on margin  we are subject to risks inherent in extending credit  especially during periods of rapidly declining markets in which the value of the collateral substantially decreases in proportion to the amount of a client s indebtedness 
while we have implemented additional risk management procedures designed to reduce this risk  there can be no assurance that we will not experience periodic or frequent unsecured account debits that materially and adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  in accordance with regulatory guidelines  we collateralize borrowings of securities by depositing cash or securities with lenders 
sharp changes in market values of substantial amounts of securities and the failure by parties to the borrowing transactions to honor their commitments could have a material  adverse effect on our revenues and profitability 
the nature of our business results in potential liability to customers many aspects of the securities  futures and forex brokerage business  including online trading services  involve substantial risks of liability 
in recent years there has been a high incidence of litigation involving the securities and futures brokerage industry  including both class action and individual suits and arbitrations that generally seek substantial damages  including in some cases punitive damages 
our proprietary order routing technology  in addition to offering charting  trade analysis and trade execution 
table of contents services of various kinds  is designed to automatically locate  with immediacy  the best available price in the appropriate market in completing execution of a trade triggered by programmed market entry and exit rules 
there are risks that the electronic communications and other systems upon which these products and services rely  and will continue to rely  or our products and services themselves  as a result of flaws or other imperfections or limitations in their designs or performance  may operate too slowly  fail  cause confusion or uncertainty to the user  or operate or produce results not understood or intended by the user 
an investor or trader using either our full electronic trading platform or our subscription service might claim that investment or trading losses or lost profits resulted from use of a flawed version of one of our trading software tools or systems  or inaccurate assumptions made by the trading software tools regarding data  or inaccurate data 
major failures of this kind may affect all customers who are online simultaneously 
any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
we do not currently carry any errors or omissions insurance that might cover  in part  some of the above described risks 
while our contracts with customers are  we believe  clear that customers who do business with us must knowingly assume all of the risks described above  there can be no assurance that a judge  arbitrator or regulator would enforce or honor such contractual provisions 
see conditions in the securities and financial markets may affect our rates of customer acquisition  retention and trading activity  and level of interest income and systems failures may result in our inability to deliver accurately  on time  or at all  important and time sensitive services to our customers above 
dependence upon outside data sources and clearing relationships creates risks outside of our control which may affect our ability to provide  and our cost to provide  market data and clearing and account services our business is currently dependent upon our ability to maintain contracts with private market and news data vendors and clearing and dealer firms in order to provide certain market data and news  and clearing and account services  respectively  to our customers 
we currently obtain nyse  amex  nasdaq  regional equities exchange  options price reporting authority opra  cme  cbot  new york mercantile exchange commodities exchange nymex comex  new york board of trade nybot  onechicago and eurex futures real time market data directly from those exchanges  and real time market depth displays directly from ecn book services  but obtain other market data such as forex data and news pursuant to non exclusive licenses from private data vendors who in turn obtain the data from exchanges or other sources 
clearing and back office account services for our brokerage customers are obtained from established clearing agents and  with respect to our self clearing operations  our software system licensing agreement with sungard 
for our forex services  we rely on a third party forex dealer firm for all trade activity account services 
the data and news contracts typically provide for royalties based on usage or minimums  the clearing contracts provide for transactional clearing fees and charges  and the contract with the forex dealer provides for sharing a fixed amount of the spread made by the forex dealer in each deal 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or maintain contracts or acceptable clearing cost or vendor fee rates 
in fact  in we needed to quickly change our futures clearing agent in response to a substantial increase in our clearing costs imposed by our former futures clearing agent 
changes or  in some cases  the failure or inability to make changes in our relationships with one or more of these third parties  or involuntary termination of one or more of those relationships  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 

table of contents we may be subject to intellectual property litigation there has been substantial litigation in the software industry involving intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that we are or will be infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others  there was recently an infringement claim asserted against us and eight other online brokerage firms by a company named datamize  inc  which could have had a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects if it was successful we settled the suit in december for an amount immaterial to our financial statements 
such a case  as well as any other infringement case that may be brought against us  could result in our being unable to use intellectual property which is integral to our business 
we may not be able to adequately protect or preserve our rights in intellectual property our success is and will continue to be heavily dependent on proprietary technology  including existing trading software  internet  web site and order execution technology  and those types of technology currently in development 
we view our technology as proprietary  and rely  and will be relying  on a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights 
we also have pending patent applications covering the tradestation electronic platform  but we do not yet know if the patents will be issued 
policing unauthorized use of our products and services is difficult  however  and we may be unable to prevent  or unsuccessful in attempts to prevent  theft  copying or other unauthorized use or exploitation of our product and service technologies 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect or defend our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies or products and services 
self clearing equity trades for active trader accounts has risks self clearing operations for our active trader equities accounts began in september and for options trades began in march prior to the september conversion of clearing services  all of our customers equities trades were cleared through bear stearns  as our clearing agent  which also provided to our active trader clients its short sale borrowing inventory 
cost savings and efficiencies of self clearing may in future periods turn out to be less favorable than we expect as a result of unanticipated increased fixed  infrastructure or incremental costs  mistakes or other factors 
further  errors made by us related to the confirmation  receipt  settlement and delivery functions involved in securities transactions  the custody and control of client securities and other assets  or otherwise relating to the handling of our clients securities and funds  could lead to civil penalties and increased deposit and other requirements by governmental and self regulatory organizations  as well as losses and liability in lawsuits relating to client accounts affected by such errors 
also  our savings may be more than offset by account losses or reduced trading activity if we experience difficulties in providing to our clients sufficient short sale borrowing inventory or if any self clearing mistakes or failures occur which undermine our customers or prospects confidence in our ability to conduct reliable self clearing operations 
also  our self clearing back office operations rely on the phase self clearing software licensed to us by sungard  and our business would likely suffer substantial harm if that software fails  fails to be adequately supported by sungard  or otherwise causes unintended results 

table of contents we may need cash in the foreseeable future while we anticipate having sufficient cash to meet our needs over the next months  our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the rate of customer acceptance of our products and services  including the number of new brokerage accounts acquired and the number and volume of trades made by our brokerage customers  the effect of price reductions  price competition that may result in our continuing to charge lower commissions and fees to customers  significant  increased infrastructure and operating costs as our business grows  large cash or security deposits which were million as of march   and which are expected to increase as our business grows  increased net capital or excess net capital requirements and unanticipated reserve and settlement requirements  unanticipated costs relating to our planned forex service offering  costs of technology development and sales  marketing  compliance  technical and administrative operations relating to increased and intensified pursuit of institutional customers  substantial legal costs and or unexpected unfavorable outcomes in lawsuits and arbitrations currently pending against us  and competing technological and market developments 
funds  if and when needed  may be raised through debt financing and or the issuance of equity securities  there being no assurance that any such type of financing on terms satisfactory to us will be available or otherwise occur 
any equity financing or debt financing which requires issuance of equity securities or warrants to the lender  or any securities litigation settlement or judgment that requires issuance of equity securities to the claimants  would reduce the percentage ownership of the shareholders of the company 
shareholders also may  if issuance of equities occurs  experience additional dilution in net book value per share  or the issued equities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing shareholders 
operation in a highly regulated industry and compliance failures may result in severe penalties and other harmful governmental or sro actions against us the securities and commodity futures industries are subject to extensive regulation covering all aspects of those businesses 
regulation of forex dealer and brokerage services is increasing as well 
the various governmental authorities and industry sros that supervise and regulate our brokerage firm have broad enforcement powers to censure  fine  suspend  enjoin  expel or issue cease and desist orders to our brokerage firm or any of its officers or employees who violate applicable laws or regulations 
additionally  rules relating specifically to active traders have been enacted and more may be enacted which severely limit the operations and potential success of our business 
for example  about six years ago  the nyse and nasd required brokerage firms to establish systems that enabled them to identify pattern day traders and to ensure that those types of accounts maintained higher minimum account balances and stricter margin maintenance requirements 
in a more recent example  in january new short sale rules promulgated by the sec became effective that could have materially  adversely affected our ability to provide quality short sale brokerage services to our equities brokerage customers 
our ability to comply with all applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our brokerage s maintenance of compliance and reporting systems  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other operations personnel and enter into suitable contractual relationships with appropriate vendors  lenders and counterparties 
we currently have pending issues relating to nasd oats reporting  nyse ots reporting  and nasd short sale procedures that could have negative consequences for our brokerage 
in general  our brokerage could be subject to disciplinary or other regulatory or legal actions  fines and penalties in the future due to noncompliance 

table of contents our brokerage must meet net capital and other financial requirements as a broker dealer that  if not satisfied  could result in severe penalties or other negative consequences  and which at all times limit our right to use all of the brokerage s cash the sec  the nasd  the cftc  the nfa  the dtcc ie  nscc and dtc  the occ  certain exchanges and other regulatory and self regulatory agencies or organizations have stringent rules with respect to the maintenance of specific levels of net capital by securities broker dealers and futures commission merchants  large  fluctuating cash deposit requirements  and reserve  settlement and other financial requirements 
net capital is the net worth of the regulated company assets minus liabilities  less deductions for certain types of assets as well as other charges 
if a firm fails to maintain the required net capital it may be subject to suspension or revocation of registration by the sec or cftc and suspension or expulsion by the nasd or nfa  and it could ultimately lead to the firm s liquidation 
if such net capital rules are changed or expanded  or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital  operations that require the use of capital would be restricted 
also  our ability to withdraw capital from our tradestation securities brokerage subsidiary is subject to sec rules  which in turn could materially impact our available working capital and materially impact or limit our ability to repay debt as and when due  redeem or purchase shares of our outstanding stock  if required or desirable  and pay dividends in the future 
a large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain our then present levels of business  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
see we may need cash in the foreseeable future above 
there are risks relating to our ability to maintain customer privacy and security and that increased government regulation of internet business may occur customers may refuse to transact business over the internet  particularly business  such as ours  that involves the handling of significant amounts of customers funds  due to privacy or security concerns 
this risk will grow if  as and to the extent cyberterrorism occurs or is perceived to be a viable  prominent threat or likelihood to occur or recur on a regular basis 
we do incorporate security measures into our privacy policies 
however  no assurances can be made that a breach of such measures will not occur  and a major breach of customer privacy or security could have serious consequences for our internet based operations  which are central to our business 
use of the internet  particularly for commercial transactions  may not continue to increase as rapidly as it has during the past few years as a result of privacy or security concerns  or for other reasons 
if this occurs  the growth of our operations would be materially hindered 
if internet activity becomes heavily regulated in these respects or otherwise  that could also have significant negative consequences for the growth of our current and planned operations 
control of tradestation group by the cruzes means that important decisions affecting the company are concentrated in the judgment of two related individuals as of march   affiliates of william r 
cruz and ralph l 
cruz the non executive co chairmen of our company owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock  and we believe that no other shareholder or related group owned more than 
therefore  the cruzes have significant control over tradestation group on matters subject to shareholder approval  including the election of our board of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of tradestation group s assets that may be proposed

the gambino settlement is not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in any period 
we continue to believe all of the claims in the remaining two cases are baseless  however  no assurances can be given that a judge or jury will agree with our assessment 
tradestation securities is also engaged in routine regulatory matters and civil litigation or other dispute resolution proceedings  including matters which are currently pending relating to nasd oats reporting  short sales procedures and short interest reporting  and two pending nasd arbitrations  incidental to  and part of the ordinary course of  its business 
the nasd regulatory matters could ultimately result in censures  sanctions  fines and other negative consequences 
while no assurances can be given  we do not believe that the ultimate outcome of any of the above legal matters or claims will result in a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we decided  as of june   to no longer carry errors or omissions insurance that covers third party claims made by brokerage customers or software subscribers as a result of alleged human or system errors  failures  acts or omissions 
this decision was made based upon our assessment of the potential risks and benefits  including significant increases in premium rates  deductibles and coinsurance amounts  reductions in available per occurrence and aggregate coverage amounts  and the unavailability of policies that sufficiently cover the types of risks that relate to our business

tradestation securities self clears most of its equities and equity options business  and uses an established futures clearing firm and an established forex dealer firm to clear its futures and forex business 
tradestation securities revenues consist primarily of transactional commissions and fees including monthly platform fees and interest derived from customer balances and margin lending to customers 
with respect to monthly platform fees a charge made to less active brokerage customers for being granted access to use the tradestation trading platform  beginning september  we launched a series of strategic marketing initiatives  the most recent as of november   which have reduced materially the trading activity thresholds that need to be met to qualify for a waiver of the monthly platform fee 
effective december   we also launched a strategic marketing initiative designed to attract high volume futures traders a change from our one price fits all futures commission structure to a tiered commission structure that rewards more active traders with lower pricing 
under the revised pricing structure  the commission charged over the applicable exchange fee ranges from down to cents per contract per side 
we believe such marketing initiatives contributed to our account growth during  however  we cannot measure specifically how many accounts have been added because of these initiatives 
the latest reduction in trading activity thresholds required to qualify for a waiver of the monthly platform fee the one effective november   assuming no benefits from additional account growth or trading  was a decrease in monthly revenues of approximately  and monthly net income by approximately  beginning in september  tradestation securities commenced equities self clearing operations for its active trader client base and commenced omnibus clearing of its standardized equity option trades through broadcort  a division of merrill lynch 
beginning march   following issuance of its membership in the occ  tradestation securities commenced full self clearing of its standardized equity options trades for its active trader client base and terminated broadcort s clearing services 
self clearing has provided substantial cost savings and efficiencies

in connection with an extension of its futures clearing agreement which was set to expire december  and the agreement with its new forex clearing agent  tradestation securities began receiving in july materially more favorable interest sharing and clearing fee deal spread sharing arrangements 
these benefits are not based on growth in trading volume or any other contingency 
effective january   a brokerage account has been defined as an account that either has a positive asset balance of at least or has had activity within the past days 
in other words  an account is deemed inactive and is not included in counting total brokerage accounts if it has less than a balance and has had no activity within the past days 
the effect of this modified account definition was a net positive adjustment of accounts as of january  ie  a positive adjustment to the number 
table of contents of futures and forex accounts exceeded a negative adjustment to the number of equities accounts by 
periods prior to have not been and will not be restated to reflect the modification to the definition 
as of december   tradestation securities had  equities  futures and forex accounts the vast majority of which were equities and futures accounts  a net increase of  accounts  or  when compared to the  accounts as adjusted as of january  during the year ended december   tradestation securities brokerage customer account base averaged  daily average revenue trades often called darts  an increase of when compared to  during the following table presents certain brokerage metrics and account information for the years ended december  change vs

daily average revenue trades darts client trading activity per account annualized trades annualized net revenue per account as of dec  jan  change client account information total brokerage accounts average assets per account equities average assets per account futures we compute darts as follows for equities and equity options  a revenue trade included to calculate darts is a commissionable trade order placed by the customer and executed  regardless of the number of shares or contracts included in the trade order 
for futures and forex  a revenue trade included to calculate darts is one round turn commissionable futures contract traded  or one round turn lot or forex deal traded  regardless of the number of individual orders made and executed ie  one futures or forex order may contain numerous contracts or deals  but each round turn contract and deal is counted as a separate revenue trade 
when viewing our darts  it should be taken into account that  for equities and equity options  we charge commissions based on share volume and number of contracts traded and not by revenue trade used to calculate darts 
for futures  we charge commissions on a per contract basis so each futures revenue trade included to calculate darts represents a round turn commissionable contract traded 
it should be noted that all darts are not equal 
the revenue we derive from each revenue trade depends on the asset in question equities  equity options  futures  forex each has a different per unit revenue structure  and  within each asset class  revenue per equity  contract or deal varies to the extent higher volume traders receive more favorable pricing  which they often do 
tradestation technologies  the company s other operating subsidiary  owns all of our intellectual property

critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income 
brokerage commissions and fees and net interest income are the key components of our results of operations and are comprised mainly of i brokerage commissions and fees earned from securities  futures and forex transactions and  to a lesser extent  monthly platform fees earned from brokerage customers using the tradestation online trading platform  and ii net interest earned and paid from self clearing operations primarily interest earned on brokerage customer cash balances and interest earned from brokerage customer margin debit balances  interest revenue sharing arrangements with clearing agent firms  and interest on corporate cash and cash equivalents 
brokerage commission income and related clearing costs are recorded on a trade date basis as transactions occur 
platform fees are recorded on an accrual basis as monthly services are provided 
interest revenue and interest expense are recorded on an accrual basis as interest is earned or incurred 
income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income tax assets should be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management evaluates and determines on a periodic basis the amount of the valuation allowance required and adjusts the valuation allowance as needed 
as of december  and  we had no valuation allowance on our deferred income tax assets 
in june  we reversed approximately million of the valuation allowance that was provided on our deferred income tax assets and  in december  we reversed the remaining valuation allowance of  in the opinion of management  it was more likely than not that these benefits would be realized 
the result of the approximately million reversal was a reduction of million to the income tax provision in the consolidated statement of income and a million credit to additional paid in capital relating to the tax benefit of stock option exercises 
the result of the  reversal was a reduction to the income tax provision recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
the decision to reverse approximately million of the valuation allowance was triggered by events which revised our expectations of the amount of future taxable income 
these events included receipt of the final approval by the dtcc for tradestation securities to begin self clearing for equities  the rollout of tradestation which included integrated options execution  as well as eight consecutive quarters of income 
table of contents from operations at the end of the second quarter 
the decision to reverse the remaining portion of the valuation allowance was triggered by our continued profitability and the accelerated growth of our income before income taxes during the last four years  as well as the expectation that we will continue to have income before income taxes in future years 
on a periodic basis  we will continue to evaluate our remaining deferred income tax assets to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
allowance for potential credit losses 
we perform periodic credit evaluations and provide allowances based upon our assessment of specifically identified unsecured receivables and other factors  including the customer s likelihood to pay and payment history 
as of december   we had an allowance for a potential credit loss of  there was no allowance as of december   since we collected  and wrote off the balance of this receivable mostly accrued interest against this reserve during the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements receivables from brokerage customers  net  and note commitments and contingencies general contingencies and guarantees 
uninsured loss reserves 
we decided  as of june   to no longer carry errors or omissions insurance that covers third party claims made by brokerage customers or software subscribers as a result of alleged human or system errors  failures  acts or omissions 
this decision was made based upon our assessment of the potential risks and benefits  including significant increases in premium rates  deductibles and coinsurance amounts  reductions in available per occurrence and aggregate coverage amounts  and the unavailability of policies that sufficiently cover the types of risks that relate to our business 
we recently reviewed this insurance with insurance agents and our view remains unchanged 
each quarter  we continue to evaluate our accruals  if any  for settlements related to claims and potential claims 
estimates of settlements for such potential claims  including related legal fees  are accrued in the consolidated financial statements  as necessary 
during  the gambino case was settled and was not material to our results of operations 
during  we recorded approximately  of expenses primarily as a result of the final resolution of two unreserved customer claims one an arbitration award  one a settlement initiated in prior periods 
during  we reversed  of our accruals  of accrued settlements and  of accrued legal fees related to a third party claim which had been inactive for over one year and has remained inactive 
see expenses other in both years ended december  and and years ended december  and we have not created any uninsured loss reserves for any of the lawsuits or arbitrations described in item legal proceedings  or to which the company is otherwise subject 
results of operations for the three years ended december   we operated in two principal business segments i brokerage services  and ii software products and services 
the brokerage services segment primarily represents the operations of tradestation securities and the software products and services segment represents the operations of tradestation technologies 
we ceased marketing our legacy software products and subscription software services in as a result  our primary sources of consolidated revenue are currently generated from the brokerage services segment  and the brokerage services segment should continue to produce the majority of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
for the years ended december   and  the brokerage services segment accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total consolidated net revenues 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of net revenue from the brokerage services segment was derived from equities and standardized equity option accounts 
conversely  for the years ended december   
table of contents  and  approximately  and  respectively  of net revenue from the brokerage services segment was derived from futures and forex accounts 
given the size of the percentage of revenue from the brokerage services segment  other than our discussion and table in note segment and related information  we will discuss our results of operations for the overall company instead of on a segmented basis

the industry has been experiencing price pressure and some of our competitors continue to reduce their online brokerage commissions and fees 
one of our competitors recently launched a commission free plan to a certain segment of its accounts

off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  there are various contingencies which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
these include customer activities involving the execution  settlement and financing of various customer securities and futures transactions 
these activities may expose the company to off balance sheet credit risk in the event the customers are unable to fulfill their contractual obligations 
nearly all tradestation securities customer accounts are margin accounts 
in margin transactions  tradestation securities may be obligated for credit extended to its customers by its clearing agents that are collateralized by cash and securities in the customers accounts with those clearing agents 
in connection with securities activities  tradestation securities also executes customer transactions involving the sale of securities not yet purchased short sales  all of which are transacted on a margin basis subject to federal  self regulatory organization and individual exchange regulations and tradestation securities and its clearing agents internal policies 
additionally  tradestation securities may be obligated for credit extended to its customers by its clearing agents for futures transactions that are collateralized by cash and futures positions in the customers accounts with those clearing agents 
in all cases  such transactions may expose tradestation securities to significant off balance sheet credit risk in the event customer collateral is not sufficient to fully cover losses that customers may incur 
in the event customers fail to satisfy their obligations  tradestation securities may be required to purchase or sell financial instruments at prevailing market prices to fulfill the customers obligations 
tradestation securities seeks to manage the risks associated with its customers activities by requiring customers to maintain collateral in their margin accounts in compliance with various regulatory requirements  internal requirements  and the requirements of clearing agents 
tradestation securities and its clearing agents monitor required margin levels on an intra day basis and  pursuant to such guidelines  require the customers to timely deposit additional collateral or to reduce positions when necessary

under the agreements  if another member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to the clearing organization and exchanges  other members would be required to meet shortfalls 
tradestation securities liability under these arrangements is not quantifiable and may exceed the cash and securities it has posted as collateral 
however  the possibility of the company being required to make payments under these arrangements is remote 
accordingly  no liability has been recorded for these potential events

sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of income based on their fair values

we have adopted the fair value provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method of adoption  compensation cost is recognized for all stock based awards issued after the effective date  and for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered ie  stock based awards granted prior to the effective date  but not yet vested as of the effective date 
under this method of transition  results for prior periods are not restated 
as a result of adopting sfas r  the charge to income before income taxes for the year ended december  was million of stock based compensation included in employee compensation and benefits in our consolidated statement of income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates or market prices 
we have established policies  procedures and internal processes governing our management of market risks in the normal course of our business operations

tradestation securities seeks to manage the risks associated with our customers activities by requiring customers to maintain margin collateral and reduce concentrated positions in compliance with regulatory and internal guidelines 
tradestation securities monitors required margin levels on an intra day basis and  pursuant to such guidelines  requires customers to deposit additional collateral  or to reduce positions  when necessary 
as a self clearing broker dealer  tradestation securities holds interest earning assets  mainly customer funds required to be segregated in compliance with federal regulations 
these funds totaled million at december  interest earning assets are financed primarily by short term interest bearing liabilities  which totaled million at december   in the form of customer cash balances 
in addition to earning interest on the customer funds segregated in compliance with federal regulations  tradestation securities earns a net interest spread on the difference between amounts earned on customer margin loans and amounts 
table of contents paid on customer cash balances 
since tradestation securities establishes the rate paid on customer cash balances and the rate charged on customer margin loans  a substantial portion of our interest rate risk is under our direct management 
tradestation securities also earns interest from interest revenue sharing arrangements with its clearing agents 
we estimate that  based upon our brokerage customer balances at december   for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates retained by the company there is an annual impact of approximately  to our net income 
changes in interest rates also affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and security deposits 
to reduce this interest rate risk  we are currently invested in investments with short maturities or investments that can be tendered for sale upon notice of no longer than seven days 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents consisted primarily of interest bearing cash deposits and money market funds  our marketable securities consisted primarily of federal tax exempt variable rate demand note securities see note of notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies marketable securities  and our security deposits consisted primarily of treasury bills and interest bearing cash deposits
