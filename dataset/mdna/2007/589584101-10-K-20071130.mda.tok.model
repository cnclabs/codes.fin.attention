overview for fiscal  we delivered our fifth consecutive year of double digit sales and earnings growth 
our diagnostics operating segments continue to provide the largest share of consolidated revenues   for fiscal compared to for fiscal our life science operating segment s sales performance improved quarter by quarter throughout fiscal  with double digit increases in the third and fourth quarters 
we are encouraged by this momentum as we enter fiscal our sales growth in fiscal was organic and driven by new diagnostic products launched in the past three years  market expansions  increased market share in targeted disease states  and volume increases for antibodies  antigens and reagents supplied to large diagnostic manufacturing companies 
our newest diagnostic product contributing to growth is immunocard stat ehec  a rapid test developed in collaboration with merck for detection of toxin producing e 
coli in patients that may have ingested contaminated produce or meat products 
we continue to see growth in the c 
difficile testing market where we hold a market leadership position 
this market has expanded as testing increases due to more virulent strains of this toxin and heightened focus by hospitals on this dangerous pathogen 
we have been well positioned with our broad line of c 
difficile products  including our newest in the portfolio  immunocard toxins a b 
our upper respiratory line of products also saw growth  as did our h 
pylori line of products 
new aga guidelines are creating increased focus on direct antigen testing for this infection that causes ulcers 
our line of patented h 
pylori products includes both rapid and batch method noninvasive direct testing formats 
we are seeing growth as more laboratories switch from serology based antibody testing to direct antigen testing 
finally  our life science operating segment has seen volume demand for antibodies  antigens  and other reagents increase with large diagnostic manufacturing companies 
financial discipline is also one of our fundamental principles in running the day to day business 
the following table illustrates key income and expense elements as a percentage of sales 
we look for continued improvement in each of these measures each year

table of contents operating segments meridian s reportable operating segments are us diagnostics  european diagnostics  and life science 
the us diagnostics operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in cincinnati  ohio  and the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in the us and countries outside of europe  africa and the middle east 
the european diagnostics operating segment consists of the sale and distribution of diagnostic test kits in europe  africa and the middle east 
the life science operating segment consists of manufacturing operations in memphis  tennessee  saco  maine  and boca raton  florida  and the sale and distribution of bulk antigens  antibodies  and bioresearch reagents domestically and abroad 
the life science operating segment also includes the contract development and manufacture of proteins and other biologicals for use by biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies engaged in research for new drugs and vaccines 
revenues for the diagnostics operating segments  in the normal course of business  may be affected from quarter to quarter by buying patterns of major distributors  seasonality and strength of certain diseases and foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues for the life science operating segment  in the normal course of business  may be affected from quarter to quarter by the timing and nature of arrangements for contract services work  which may have longer production cycles than bioresearch reagents and bulk antigens and antibodies  as well as buying patterns of major customers 
meridian believes that the overall breadth of its product lines serves to reduce the variability in consolidated sales from quarter to quarter 
results of operations overview fourth quarter net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased to  or per diluted share increased from net earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal of  or per diluted share 
this increase is primarily attributable to increased sales and continuing efforts to improve operating efficiency across all businesses 
net sales for the fourth quarter of fiscal were  an increase of  or compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  meridian determined that the carrying value of a supply contract with the united states department of defense related to the life science operating segment had become impaired and recorded such impairment to general and administrative expenses in the amount of  the contract provided for the supply of biological materials during a base period and also contained four optional month renewal periods through march  changes in the department s critical reagents program lowered the amount of materials to be supplied under the contract 
during march  the department informed meridian 
table of contents that it would not be exercising the optional renewal period from april  through march  meridian does not expect to supply any more materials under this contract  and as of september   this contract had no carrying value 
prior to july   the cost of certain inventories within the life science operating segment was determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
effective july   we changed our method of accounting for this inventory from the lifo method to the fifo method  and now substantially all of our inventories are reflected at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the fifo method 
we changed to the fifo method for these inventories because it conforms substantially all of our worldwide inventories to a consistent basis of accounting  and it provides better comparability to our industry peers  many of whom use the fifo method of accounting for inventories 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  the change in accounting has been retrospectively applied to all prior periods presented herein 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
fiscal year net earnings for fiscal increased to  or per diluted share increased from net earnings for fiscal of  or per diluted share 
results of operations for fiscal compared to fiscal are discussed below 
net earnings and earnings per share for fiscal include the effects of a tax benefit in the amount of  or per basic and diluted share  related to a discrete adjustment to tax reserves that was recorded in the third quarter upon the expiration of the statute of limitations on certain income tax returns see note to the consolidated financial statements herein 
the tables below provide information on net earnings  basic earnings per share  and diluted earnings per share  excluding this tax benefit  as well as reconciliations to amounts reported under us generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that this information is useful to those who read our financial statements and evaluate our operating results because these measures help to appropriately evaluate and compare the results of operations from period to period by removing the favorable impact of a discrete material item that is not expected to recur in the future  and these measures are used by our management for various purposes  including evaluating performance against incentive bonus achievement targets  comparing performance from period to period in presentations to our board of directors  and as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting

difficile products increased  reflecting volume increases for immunocard toxins a b and premier tm toxins a b 
sales of respiratory products increased  also contributed to the increase  driven by increased market share and increased purchases by one national distributor 
meridian s respiratory products include diagnostic tests for influenza  respiratory syncytial virus rsv  and mycoplasma 
h 
pylori sales increased  contributed to the increase due to increased managed care efforts  issuance of aga guidelines recommending direct testing  and increased marketing of premier tm platinum hpsa plus 
volume increases for parasitology products increased  related to the exit of a competitor from the marketplace  food borne products increased  related to the launch of immunocard stat ehec  and volume increases in specimen transport products  also contributed to favorable variances to fiscal these favorable variances more than offset an unfavorable variance of  for microbiology products related to reduced purchases of one product by one international customer

gross profit gross profit increased for fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit margins were for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase reflects higher margins commanded by volume increases in rapid tests  such as immunocard toxins a b and operating efficiencies 
we have also seen improvements in gross profit margins related to automation initiatives and related efficiencies in diagnostic production areas 
our overall operations consist of the sale of diagnostic test kits for various disease states and in alternative test formats  as well as bioresearch reagents  bulk antigens and antibodies  proficiency panels  and contract research and development and contract manufacturing services 
product sales mix shifts  in the normal course of business  can cause the consolidated gross profit margin to fluctuate by several points 
operating expenses operating expenses increased for fiscal compared to fiscal the overall increase in operating expenses for fiscal is discussed below 
research and development expenses increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  and as a percentage of sales  were in fiscal compared to in fiscal of this increase   related to the us diagnostics operating segment and  related to the life science operating segment

the increase for the european diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the euro currency and one planned headcount addition 
the decrease for the us diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to lower costs for sales promotions  advertising and distributor incentives  offset by increased salaries and benefits related to headcount additions and stock based compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and as a percentage of sales  decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal of this increase   related to the us diagnostics operating segment  offset by decreases of  related to the life science operating segment and  related to the european diagnostics operating segment 
the increase for the us diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to higher costs for stock based compensation  an insurance recovery in fiscal  and increased salaries and benefits  including the effects of planned headcount additions 
the decrease for the life science operating segment was primarily attributable to the impairment of the supply contract with the united states department of defense 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
the decrease for the european diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to expenses connected with an employee matter in fiscal  which were covered by the aforementioned insurance recovery 
effective july   meridian adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  in accounting for its stock option plans 
the amount of stock based compensation expense reported for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal was   and  respectively 
during november  meridian granted to certain employees   stock options that were contingent upon meridian achieving a specified income level for fiscal meridian s fiscal net income surpassed the minimum level  and thus  these stock options were earned and are now exercisable over a vesting period 
fiscal stock based compensation cost for these stock options  in accordance with sfas no

research and development expenses increased for fiscal compared to fiscal  and as a percentage of sales  were in fiscal and fiscal of this increase   related to the us diagnostics operating segment and  related to the life science operating segment 
the us diagnostics operating segment increase was primarily attributable to increased stock compensation expense 
for the life science operating segment  during fiscal  research and development scientists were performing contract work for third party customers  and thus  their related costs were classified in cost of sales 
during fiscal  their efforts and activities were primarily focused on internal research and development work  and therefore charged to research and development expense  rather than being classified in cost of sales or inventory 
the increase for the life science operating segment reflects the classification of such costs 

table of contents selling and marketing expenses increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal  and as a percentage of sales  decreased from for fiscal to for fiscal of this increase   related to the us diagnostics operating segment and  related to the life science operating segment  partially offset by a decrease of  for the european diagnostics operating segment 
the increase for the us diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to sales administration fees to group purchasing organizations and incentive compensation associated with higher sales levels  as well as higher salaries and benefits costs 
the increase for the life science operating segment was primarily due to business development costs and a full year of costs for the oem concepts business  acquired during the second quarter of fiscal the decrease for the european diagnostics operating segment was primarily attributable to fluctuations in the euro currency

the increase for the life science operating segment was primarily attributable to the impairment of a supply contract related to the acquisition of oem concepts 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
operating income operating income increased in fiscal  as a result of the factors discussed above 
other income and expense interest income was  for fiscal  and related primarily to interest earned on proceeds from the september common share offering that have been primarily invested in tax exempt securities 
interest expense declined for fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was attributable to the positive effects of the debenture conversion and redemption transactions discussed under liquidity and capital resources herein 
income taxes the effective rate for income taxes was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the favorable effects of tax exempt interest and domestic production incentives under the american jobs creation act 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources comparative cash flow analysis our operating cash flow and financing requirements are determined by analyses of operating and capital spending budgets and consideration of acquisition plans 
we have historically maintained revolving line of credit availability to respond quickly to acquisition opportunities 
this revolving line of credit is supplemented by the proceeds from a september common share offering  which are invested in tax exempt  cash equivalent securities and institutional money market funds 
net cash provided by operating activities increased to  in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to higher earnings levels 
the discrete tax reserve adjustment in the amount of  was non cash in nature 
net cash used in investing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower acquisition earnout payments in fiscal and proceeds from sales of short term auction rate securities in fiscal that were purchased in fiscal net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in dividend payments  offset by  in additional proceeds and tax benefits from the exercise of stock options 
dividend payments in fiscal reflect increased dividend rates and common shares outstanding related to stock option exercises and bond conversions 
net cash flows from operating activities are anticipated to fund working capital requirements and dividends during fiscal capital resources during august  meridian completed the renewal of its credit facility with its commercial bank 
the amount of the credit facility is  which expires september  as of november   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
as of september   meridian had outstanding  principal amount of debentures  convertible  at the option of the holder  into common shares at a price of 
during fiscal  these debentures were either converted into common shares at the direction of the holders  or redeemed by meridian 

table of contents the viral antigens acquisition  completed in fiscal  provided for additional purchase consideration  contingent upon viral antigens future earnings through september  final earnout consideration in the amount of  relating to fiscal was paid from operating cash flows during the second quarter of fiscal the oem concepts acquisition  completed in fiscal  provides for additional purchase consideration up to a maximum remaining amount of  contingent upon future calendar year sales and gross profit of oem concepts products through december  earnout consideration is payable each year  following the period earned 
earnout consideration in the amount of  related to calendar was paid from operating cash flows during the second quarter of fiscal earnout consideration in the amount of  for the first nine months of calendar is accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
meridian s capital expenditures are estimated to be approximately  to  for fiscal  and may be funded with cash and equivalents on hand  operating cash flows  and or availability under the  credit facility discussed above 
capital expenditures relate to manufacturing and other equipment of a normal and recurring nature as well as capacity expansion for the maine facility 

table of contents known contractual obligations known contractual obligations and their related due dates were as follows as of september  dollars in thousands less than more than total year years years years operating leases purchase obligations oem concepts earnout total meridian and its subsidiaries are lessees of i office and warehouse buildings in florida  belgium  and france  ii automobiles for use by the diagnostic direct sales forces in the us and europe  and iii certain office equipment such as facsimile machines and copier machines across all business units  under operating lease agreements that expire at various dates 
meridian s purchase obligations are primarily outstanding purchase orders for inventory and service items 
these contractual commitments are not in excess of expected production requirements over the next twelve months 
oem concepts earnout obligation is contingent upon future calendar year sales and gross profit of oem concepts products through december  other commitments and off balance sheet arrangements license agreements meridian has entered into various license agreements that require payment of royalties based on a specified percentage of sales of related products to 
meridian expects that payments under these agreements will amount to as much as  in fiscal these royalty payments primarily relate to the us diagnostics operating segment 
during october  meridian entered into a license agreement with eiken chemical co  ltd  that provides rights to eiken s loop mediated isothermal amplification technology for infectious disease testing in the united states and other geographic markets 
the agreement calls for payments of up to  japanese yen approximately  based on the achievement of certain milestones and on going royalties once products are available for commercial sale 
payments made during product development are expected to occur 
table of contents over a five year period  which began in fiscal a payment equal to  japanese yen was made during fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began seeking recovery of approximately  of past royalties paid and interest under a license agreement around certain rapid diagnostic testing technology 
this license agreement covered patent rights that were narrowed in scope via other litigation with the licensor that did not involve meridian 
we strongly believe that the licensed patent  as reissued  does not cover any of our products 
we also ceased further royalty payments under this license agreement 
the licensor to this agreement disputes our position that the patent  as reissued  does not cover our products 
although we believe that our position is very strong  we are unable to predict the outcome of this matter 
no provision has been made in the accompanying financial statements for on going royalties  if any  nor has any accrual or income been recorded for recovery of past royalties paid 
derivative financial instruments meridian accounts for its derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges  and therefore  the effective portion of the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for the ineffective portion of the hedge  gains or losses are charged to earnings in the current period 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
other meridian does not utilize any special purpose financing vehicles or have any undisclosed off balance sheet arrangements 
similarly  the company holds no fair value contracts for which a lack of marketplace quotations would necessitate the use of fair value techniques 
market risk exposure foreign currency risk we have market risk exposure related to foreign currency transactions 
meridian is exposed to foreign currency risk related to its european distribution operations  including foreign currency denominated intercompany sales and receivables 
we enter into contractual forward exchange contracts to hedge cash flows from intercompany sales between our us parent company and its italian affiliate 
the counterparties to these 
table of contents contracts are major financial institutions 
hedging activities are further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
concentration of customers products risk our us diagnostic operating segment s sales through two distributors were of the us diagnostics operating segment s total sales for fiscal or of consolidated total sales for fiscal three internally developed products  premier platinum hpsa plus  premier toxins a b  and immunocard toxins a b  accounted for of our us diagnostics operating segment s third party sales during fiscal these same three products accounted for of our european diagnostics operating segment s third party sales and of our total consolidated sales for fiscal our life science operating segment s sales of purified antigens and reagents to one customer were of the life science operating segment s total sales for fiscal or of our consolidated total sales for fiscal our life science operating segment has five other significant customers who purchase antigens  antibodies and reagents  which together comprised of the operating segment s total sales for fiscal critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require management to make judgments about estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
management believes that the following accounting policies are critical to understanding the accompanying consolidated financial statements because the application of such polices requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions and the carrying values of related assets and liabilities are material 
revenue recognition our revenues are derived primarily from product sales 
revenue is generally recognized when product is shipped and title has passed to the buyer 
revenue for the us diagnostics operating segment is reduced at the date of sale for estimated rebates that will be claimed by customers 
rebate agreements are in place with certain independent national distributors and are designed to reimburse such distributors for their cost in handling meridian s products 
management estimates rebate accruals based on historical statistics  current trends  and other factors 
changes to these rebate accruals are recorded in the period that they become known 
life science revenue for contract services may come from standalone arrangements for process development and or optimization work contract research and development services or custom manufacturing  or multiple 
table of contents deliverable arrangements that include process development work followed by larger scale manufacturing both contract research and development services and contract manufacturing services 
revenue is recognized based on the nature of the arrangements  using the principles in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the framework in eitf is based on each of the multiple deliverables in a given arrangement having distinct and separate fair values 
fair values are determined via consistent pricing between standalone arrangements and multiple deliverable arrangements  as well as a competitive bidding process 
contract research and development services may be performed on a time and materials basis or fixed fee basis 
for time and materials arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are performed and billed 
for fixed fee arrangements  revenue is recognized upon completion and acceptance by the customer 
for contract manufacturing services  revenue is recognized upon delivery of product and acceptance by the customer 
inventories our inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we establish reserves against cost for excess and obsolete materials  finished goods whose shelf life may expire before sale to customers  and other identified exposures 
such reserves were  and  at september  and  respectively 
management estimates these reserves based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions were to be less favorable than such estimates  additional inventory write downs would be required and recorded in the period known 
such adjustments would negatively affect gross profit margin and overall results of operations 
intangible assets our intangible assets include identifiable intangibles and goodwill 
identifiable intangibles include customer lists  supply agreements  manufacturing technologies  patents  licenses  and trade names 
all of meridian s identifiable intangibles have finite lives 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets provides that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment review or more frequently if impairment indicators arise by applying a fair value based test 
there have been no impairments from the analyses required by sfas no 
identifiable intangibles with finite lives are subject to impairment testing as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 identifiable intangibles with finite lives are reviewed for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that such assets may not be recoverable at their current carrying value 
whether an event or circumstance triggers impairment is determined by comparing an estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows to its 
table of contents carrying value 
if impairment has occurred  it is measured by a fair value based test 
during fiscal  meridian determined that the carrying value of a supply contract related to the life science operating segment had become impaired and recorded such impairment in the amount of  to general and administrative expenses 
the contract provided for the supply of biological materials to the united states department of defense 
changes in the department s critical reagents program lowered the amount of materials to be supplied under the contract and ultimately led to the contract having a shorter life than originally expected 
there have been no events or circumstances in fiscal indicating that the carrying value of other such assets may not be recoverable 
our ability to recover intangible assets  both identifiable intangibles and goodwill  is dependent upon the future cash flows of the related acquired businesses and assets 
the application of sfas nos 
and requires management to make judgments and assumptions regarding future cash flows  including sales levels  gross profit margins  operating expense levels  working capital levels  and capital expenditures 
with respect to identifiable intangibles  management also makes judgments and assumptions regarding useful lives 
management considers the following factors in evaluating events and circumstances for possible impairment i significant under performance relative to historical or projected operating results  ii negative industry trends  iii sales levels of specific groups of products related to specific identifiable intangibles  iv changes in overall business strategies and v other factors 
if actual cash flows are less favorable than projections  impairment of intangible assets could take place 
if impairment were to occur  this would negatively affect overall results of operations 
income taxes pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  our provision for income taxes includes federal  foreign  state  and local income taxes currently payable and those deferred because of temporary differences between income for financial reporting and income for tax purposes 
we prepare estimates of permanent and temporary differences between income for financial reporting purposes and income for tax purposes 
these differences are adjusted to actual upon filing of our tax returns  typically occurring in the third and fourth quarters of the current fiscal year for the preceding fiscal year s estimates 
our deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryforwards in foreign jurisdictions 
the realization of tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income in the applicable jurisdictions 
management assesses the level of deferred tax asset valuation allowance by taking into consideration historical and future projected operating results  future reversals of taxable temporary differences  as well as tax planning strategies 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable 
table of contents could be reduced in future years if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
undistributed earnings in our italian subsidiary are considered by management to be permanently re invested in such subsidiary 
consequently  us deferred tax liabilities on such earnings have not been recorded 
management believes that such us taxes would be largely offset by foreign tax credits for taxes paid locally in italy 
from time to time  our tax returns in federal  state  and foreign jurisdictions are examined by the applicable tax authorities 
our tax provisions take into consideration the judgmental nature of certain tax positions through the establishment of reserves for differences between the probable tax determinations and the as filed tax positions of certain assets and liabilities 
to the extent that adjustments result from the completion of these examinations or the passing of statutes of limitation  they will affect tax liabilities in the period known 
we believe that the results of any tax authority examinations would not have a significant adverse impact on financial condition or results of operation
