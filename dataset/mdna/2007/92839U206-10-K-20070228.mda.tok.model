overview and financial results the automotive industry remains challenging in north america and europe  with continued market share pressures concentrated with us vehicle manufacturers 
while the ach transactions significantly reduced the company s exposure to ford s north america vehicle production  ford remains an important customer  accounting for of the company s product sales 
however  ford north america production volumes decreased by approximately  units or during  which was partially offset by an increase in ford europe production volume 
further  the company has significant content on certain key nissan vehicles produced for the north american market and psa peugeot citroen and renault nissan vehicles produced for the european market  all of which posted year over year production declines 
the company s net product sales and gross margin for the year ended december  were pressured by these vehicle production declines  unfavorable vehicle mix  a weakening aftermarket business in north america and deteriorating performance of certain western european manufacturing facilities 
these pressures were partially offset by net sales increases associated with new business launches and continued growth in the company s asia pacific operations

these new programs will further diversify the company s sales base in future years 
gross margin the company s gross margin was million in  compared with million in  representing an increase of million or 
the increase in gross margin was attributable to efficiencies achieved through manufacturing  purchasing and ongoing restructuring efforts and certain one time cost benefits  including postretirement benefit relief resulting from the assumption of such obligation by ford related to company employees transferred to ford in connection with two ach manufacturing facilities 
these favorable items were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of lower ford north america vehicle production  unfavorable product mix  and lower vehicle production volume of other customers 
the company continues to take actions to lower its manufacturing costs by increasing its focus on production utilization and related investment  closure and consolidation of facilities and relocation of production to lower cost environments to take further advantage of its global manufacturing footprint

however  there is no assurance that a transaction or other arrangement will occur in the near term or at all 
the company s ultimate course of action for these facilities will be dependent upon that which provides the greatest long term return to shareholders 
generally  expenses related to the multi year improvement plan are recorded as elements of the plan are finalized and the timing of activities and the amount of related costs are not likely to change

throughout  the company continued to perform organizational restructuring activities to build its engineering capability in more competitive cost locations  and re examine its current third party supplier arrangements for purchased services to further reduce the company s administrative and engineering costs 
while the company continues its efforts to improve its operations  restructure its business  and achieve profitable growth  there can be no assurances that the results of these efforts alone will be sufficient to address the impact of current industry and market trends

critical accounting estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  accordingly  the company s accounting policies have been disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company considers an estimate to be a critical accounting estimate when the estimate involves matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and different estimates or changes to an estimate could have a material impact on the reported financial position  changes in financial condition  or results of operations 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that it considers to be the most appropriate given the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires the company s management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties 
estimates are typically based upon historical experience  current trends  contractual documentation  and other information  as appropriate 
due to the inherent uncertainty involving estimates  actual results reported in the future may differ from those estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements 
pension plans and other postretirement employee benefit plans using appropriate actuarial methods and assumptions  the company s defined benefit pension and non pension postretirement employee benefit plans are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively  and as amended by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
disability  early retirement and other postretirement employee benefits are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employer accounting for postemployment benefits 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the determination of the company s obligation and expense for its pension and other postretirement employee benefits  such as retiree health care and life insurance  is dependent on the company s selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
selected assumptions are described in note employee retirement benefits to the company s consolidated financial statements  which are incorporated herein by reference  including the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  accordingly  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
therefore  assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods 
the primary assumptions affecting the company s accounting for employee benefits under sfas nos 
  and as of december  are as follows long term rate of return on plan assets the expected long term rate of return is used to calculate net periodic pension cost 
the required use of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized returns that are greater or less than the actual returns on those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is designed to approximate actual earned long term returns 
the expected long term rate of return for pension assets has been chosen based on various inputs  including long term historical returns for the different asset classes held by the company s trusts and its asset allocation  as well as inputs from internal and external sources regarding capital market returns  inflation and other variables 
in determining its pension expense for  the company used long term rates of return on plan assets ranging from to outside the us and in the us actual returns on us pension assets for  and were  and  respectively  compared to the expected rate of return assumption of  and respectively  for each of those years 
the company s market related value of pension assets reflects changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period  with a one third weighting to the most recent year 
discount rate the discount rate is used to calculate pension and postretirement employee obligations 
the discount rate assumption is based on market rates for a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds rated aa or better with maturities closely matched to the timing of projected benefit payments for each plan at its annual measurement date 
the company used discount rates ranging from to to determine its pension and other benefit obligations as of december   including weighted average discount rates of for us pension plans  for us pension plans  and for postretirement employee health care and life insurance plans 
health care cost trend for postretirement employee health care plan accounting  the company reviews external data and company specific historical trends for health care costs to determine the health care cost trend rate assumptions 
in determining the projected benefit obligation for postretirement employee health care plans as of december   the company used health care cost trend rates of  declining to an ultimate trend rate of in 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued while the company believes that these assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for company sponsored us and us pension plans on its funded status and pre tax pension expense excludes certain salaried employees that are covered by a ford sponsored plan impact on impact on us impact on non us impact on pre tax pension us plan pre tax pension non us plan expense funded status expense funded status basis point decrease in discount rate a million million million million basis point increase in discount rate a million million million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets a million million basis point increase in expected return on assets a million million a assumes all other assumptions are held constant 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to visteon sponsored postretirement employee health care and life insurance plans expense excludes certain salaried that employees are covered by a ford sponsored plan impact on impact on visteon pre tax opeb sponsored plan expense funded status basis point decrease in discount rate a million million basis point increase in discount rate a million million a assumes all other assumptions are held constant 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the assumed health care trend rate related to visteon sponsored postretirement employee health expense excludes certain salaried employees that are covered by a ford sponsored plan total service and interest cost apbo basis point increase in health care trend rate a million million basis point decrease in health care trend rate a million million a assumes all other assumptions are held constant 
effective october  and in connection with the ach transactions  ford relieved the company of all liabilities associated with postretirement employee health care and life insurance related obligations for visteon assigned ford uaw employees and retirees and for salaried retirees who retired prior to may  the amount of benefit relief pursuant to the ach transactions totaled billion 
the company continues to have a financial obligation to ford for the cost of providing selected health care and life insurance benefits to certain visteon salaried employees who retire after may  the health care and life insurance costs for these employees are calculated using ford s assumptions 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas requires that long lived assets and intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment when certain indicators of impairment are present 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
generally  when impairment exists the long lived assets are adjusted to their respective fair values 
in assessing long lived assets for an impairment loss  assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
asset grouping requires a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  facts and circumstances will influence how asset groups are determined for impairment testing 
in assessing long lived assets for impairment  management considered the company s product line portfolio  customers and related commercial agreements  labor agreements and other factors in grouping assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent 
additionally  in determining fair value of long lived assets  management uses appraisals  management estimates or discounted cash flow calculations 
product warranty and recall the company accrues for warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates  with support from the company s sales  engineering  quality and legal functions  of the amount that eventually will be required to settle such obligations 
this accrual is based on several factors  including contractual arrangements  past experience  current claims  production changes  industry developments and various other considerations 
the company accrues for product recall claims related to potential financial participation in customers actions to provide remedies related primarily to safety concerns as a result of actual or threatened regulatory or court actions or the company s determination of the potential for such actions 
the company accrues for recall claims for products sold based on management estimates  with support from the company s engineering  quality and legal functions 
amounts accrued are based upon management s best estimate of the amount that will ultimately be required to settle such claims 
environmental matters the company is subject to the requirements of federal  state  local and international environmental and occupational safety and health laws and regulations 
these include laws regulating air emissions  water discharge and waste management 
the company is also subject to environmental laws requiring the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at properties it presently owns or operates and at third party disposal or treatment facilities to which these sites send or arranged to send hazardous waste 
at the time of spin off  the company and ford agreed on a division of liability for  and responsibility for management and remediation of  environmental claims existing at that time  and  further  that the company would assume all liabilities for existing and future claims relating to sites that were transferred to it and its operation of those sites  including off site disposal  except as otherwise specifically retained by ford in the master transfer agreement 
in connection with the ach transactions  ford agreed to re assume these liabilities to the extent they arise from the ownership or operation prior to the spin off of the locations transferred to ach excluding any increase in costs attributable to the exacerbation of such liability by the company or its affiliates 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company is aware of contamination at some of its properties and relating to various third party superfund sites at which the company or its predecessor has been named as a potentially responsible party 
the company is in various stages of investigation and cleanup at these sites 
at december   the company had recorded a reserve of approximately million for this environmental investigation and cleanup 
however  estimating liabilities for environmental investigation and cleanup is complex and dependent upon a number of factors beyond the company s control and which may change dramatically 
accordingly  although the company believes its reserve is adequate based on current information  the company cannot provide any assurance that its ultimate environmental investigation and cleanup costs and liabilities will not exceed the amount of its current reserve 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets by tax jurisdiction when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
management judgment is required in determining the company s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes have been provided for the net effect of repatriating earnings from certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks from changes in currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices 
to manage these risks  the company uses a combination of fixed price contracts with suppliers  cost sourcing arrangements with customers and financial derivatives 
the company maintains risk management controls to monitor the risks and the related hedging 
derivative positions are examined using analytical techniques such as market value and sensitivity analysis 
derivative instruments are not used for speculative purposes  as per clearly defined risk management policies 
foreign currency risk the company s net cash inflows and outflows exposed to the risk of changes in exchange rates arise from the sale of products in countries other than the manufacturing source  foreign currency denominated supplier payments  debt and other payables  subsidiary dividends and investments in subsidiaries 
the company s on going solution is to reduce the exposure through operating actions 
the company s primary foreign exchange operating exposures include the korean won  mexican peso  euro and czech koruna 
because of the mix between the company s costs and revenues in various regions  operating results are exposed generally to weakening of the euro and to strengthening of the korean won  mexican peso  and czech koruna 
for transactions in these currencies  the company utilizes a strategy of partial coverage 
as of december   the company s coverage for projected transactions in these currencies was approximately for 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk continued as of december  and  the net fair value of foreign currency forward and option contracts were assets of million and million  respectively 
the hypothetical pre tax gain or loss in fair value from a change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these estimated changes assume a parallel shift in all currency exchange rates and include the gain or loss on financial instruments used to hedge loans to subsidiaries 
because exchange rates typically do not all move in the same direction  the estimate may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on the net fair value of the company s financial derivatives 
it is also important to note that gains and losses indicated in the sensitivity analysis would generally be offset by gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
interest rate risk the company monitors its exposure to interest rate risk principally in relation to fixed rate and variable rate debt 
the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to fluctuations in interest rates in connection with its risk management policies 
accordingly  the company has entered into certain fixed for variable and variable for fixed interest rate swap agreements to manage such interest rate exposures 
the company has entered into interest rate swaps for a portion of the notes due august  million and a portion of the notes due march  million 
these interest rate swaps effectively convert the designated portions of these notes from fixed interest rate to variable interest rate instruments 
additionally  the company has entered into interest rate swaps for a portion of the billion term loan due million  effectively converting the designated portion of this loan from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate instrument 
approximately of the company s borrowings were effectively on a fixed rate basis as of both december  and as of december  and  the net fair value of interest rate swaps were liabilities of million and million  respectively 
the potential loss in fair value of these swaps from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would be approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the annual increase in pre tax interest expense from a hypothetical basis point adverse change in variable interest rates including the impact of interest rate swaps would be approximately million as of december  and this analysis may overstate the adverse impact on net interest expense because of the short term nature of the company s interest bearing investments 
commodity risk the company s exposure to market risks from changes in the price of steel products  plastic resins  and diesel fuel are not hedged due to a lack of acceptable hedging instruments in the market 
the company s exposures to price changes in these commodities and non ferrous metals are attempted to be addressed through negotiations with the company s suppliers and customers  although there can be no assurance that the company will not have to absorb any or all price increases and or surcharges 
when  and if  acceptable hedging instruments are available in the market  management will determine at that time if financial hedging is appropriate  depending upon the company s exposure level at that time  the effectiveness of the financial hedge and other factors 
in the second quarter of  the company discontinued hedge accounting treatment for natural gas and copper forward contracts 
discontinuance of hedge accounting for hedges on transactions that were not expected to occur resulted in the reclassification of a gain of approximately million from accumulated other comprehensive income loss to net income loss 
these forward contracts were subsequently terminated during the third quarter of since completion of the ach transactions on october   the company s exposure to market risks from changes in the price of natural gas and copper has been substantially reduced
