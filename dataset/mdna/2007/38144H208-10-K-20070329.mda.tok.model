this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could vary materially from those indicated  implied or suggested by these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this prospectus 
for an overview of our business segments  including a description of products and services that we provide  see the section entitled business 
recent developments on october   we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock in a secondary public offering at a price of per share for proceeds  net of underwriting fees  of  subsequently  on october   the underwriter exercised the over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share for proceeds  net of underwriting fees  of  the proceeds from the offering were used to redeem our series a and c preferred stock and certain of our warrants held by lightyear at a total redemption price of approximately million with the remaining offering proceeds and the proceeds from the over allotment option being used to pay down the full million balance under our bank of america credit facility 
on october   we also issued  new common shares to lightyear  representing ownership of our fully diluted common stock as of october   in exchange for the  common stock warrants held by lightyear and the release of lightyear from its guaranty of our term b note 
the company also redeemed all outstanding series b preferred shares at the stated redemption price  plus accrued and unpaid dividends  on december  the total amount of the redemption and accrued dividends was million 
as a result of the series b redemption we recorded a deemed distribution of approximately million during the quarter ended december  overview we provide a suite of technology based products and services that help community financial institutions compete more effectively with larger regional and national financial institutions 
we believe that community financial institutions  which have traditionally competed on personalized service  are facing increasing challenges to improve their operating efficiencies and grow their customer base 
these challenges include growing competition with larger national and regional banks  the emergence of non traditional competitors  the compression of margins on traditional products  the convergence of financial products into a single institution  and legislative changes accelerating the need for financial institutions to offer a wider range of products and services to their customers 
we believe that these competitive pressures are particularly acute for community financial institutions  which lack the substantial capital and specialized personnel to address their technology needs internally 
our solutions enable our clients to focus on their core competencies while we help them meet their product and technology needs 
we provide our solutions primarily on an outsourced basis 
the financial technology industry is currently characterized by significant acquisition activity  the introduction of new product and service offerings for financial institutions and an increased emphasis on security of customer data 
we believe that these trends will result in greater opportunities for providers of financial technology 
historically  we have generated our revenues primarily from participation fees  software licenses fees  maintenance fees and insurance brokerage fees derived from businessmanager  our accounts receivable financing solution  and from fees associated with our retail inventory management services product 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our consolidated revenues from businessmanager and approximately of our consolidated revenues from retail inventory management services 
we expect to continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenues from these sources during and for some period thereafter 
in recent years  our revenues from businessmanager and retail inventory management services have declined from year to year  and this trend may continue 
given the above trends in the performance of our businessmanager and retail inventory management services businesses  we decided in december to broaden our strategy to add other products and services that we believed offered greater opportunity for future growth  with the goal of providing a suite of solutions primarily to community financial institutions 
we accomplished this shift in strategy by acquiring captiva  which added core data processing as well as image and item processing  ptc  which added teller automation systems  and goldleaf technologies  which added ach processing  remote capture processing  and website design and hosting 
we paid approximately million for these acquisitions and our earlier acquisition of kvi capital in july  and we recorded goodwill totaling approximately million 
in further pursuit of our strategy  we intend to acquire businesses  products or technologies to expand our suite of solutions 
in addition to these acquisitions  we further implemented our strategy by adding several new members to our management team who have significant industry experience  including lynn boggs  our new chief executive officer 
we now offer products and services to over  community financial institutions  which gives us an opportunity to cross sell our full range of products and services across our client base 
revenues we generate revenue from three main sources financial institution service fees  retail inventory management services  and other products and services 
financial institution service fees financial institution service fees include participation fees  insurance brokerage fees and maintenance fees  core data processing and image processing fees  software license and maintenance fees  ach origination and processing fees  remote capture and deposit processing fees  leasing revenues  and financial institution website design and hosting fees 
participation fees  insurance brokerage fees and maintenance fees from our accounts receivable financing solution 
we derive revenue from two types of participation fees 
first  we earn a fee during the first days after a client financial institution implements our solution and purchases accounts receivable from its small business customers 
second  we earn an ongoing participation fee from subsequent purchases of accounts receivable by the client 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the accounts receivable that the client purchases during each month  with the second type of fee being a smaller percentage of the accounts receivable purchased 
insurance brokerage fees are derived from the sale of credit and fraud insurance products issued by a third party national insurance company 
we earn fees based on a percentage of the premium paid to the insurance company 
we recognize these commission revenues when our financial institution clients purchase the accounts receivable covered by credit and fraud insurance policies 
core data processing and image processing fees 
we generate support and service fees from implementation services  from ongoing support services to assist the client in operating the systems and to enhance and update the software and from providing outsourced core data processing services 
we derive revenues from outsourced item and core data processing services from monthly usage fees  typically under multi year contracts with our clients 
software license and maintenance fees 
we derive software license fees from the sale of software associated with our accounts receivable financing solutions and our core data processing solution 
software license fees for our accounts receivable financing solutions consist of two components a license fee and a client training and support fee 
we receive these one time fees on the initial licensing of our program to a client financial institution 
our license agreements have terms ranging from three to five years and are renewable for subsequent terms 
we generate annual software maintenance fees from our client financial institutions starting on the first anniversary of the businessmanager license agreement and annually thereafter 
we license our core data processing product under standard license agreements that typically provide the client with a non exclusive  non transferable right to use the software 
we generate annual software maintenance fees from our client financial institutions starting on the first anniversary of the core data processing license agreement and annually thereafter 
ach origination and processing  remote capture and deposit processing fees 
we license these products via up front fees to financial institutions at the time of execution of the agreements  which are typically five year contracts 
we recognize these up front fees when we complete customer implementation  which typically occurs within the first thirty days after contract execution 
we also generate monthly fees for hosting services from each originator of ach transactions  and we receive fees for each ach transaction that occurs each month 
we offer annual hosting and maintenance support to all of our financial institution clients for a fee that is generally equal to to of the up front fees 
leasing revenues 
subsequent to our acquisition of kvi capital in august  we began to offer equipment leasing services to some of our clients 
we have no credit risk exposure for these leases 
our leases fall into two categories direct financing leases and operating leases 
for direct financing leases  the investment in direct financing leases caption consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments due during the remaining term of the lease and unguaranteed residual value of the leased asset 
we record the difference between this sum and the cost of the leased asset as unearned income 
we amortize unearned income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
for leases classified as operating leases  we record the leased asset at cost and depreciate the leased asset 
we record lease payments as rent income during the period earned 
financial institution website design and hosting fees 
we offer website design and hosting services to financial institutions  although we do not host any confidential bank data on our servers 
the revenues we generate for these services consist of up front fees associated with the design and implementation of each website and monthly hosting fees for hosting each website in our data center 
retail inventory management services we generate retail inventory management services revenue from fees we charge primarily for providing inventory merchandising and forecasting information for specialty retail stores and ancillary services related to these products 
we use proprietary software to process sales and inventory transactions and provide the merchandising forecasting information 
historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from fees associated with our accounts receivable financing solutions and retail inventory management services 
while we believe that our acquisitions and product diversification will enable us to derive revenues from a broader mix of products and services  we anticipate that revenues derived from our accounts receivable solutions and inventory management services will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in and for a period thereafter

financial institution service fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decline in revenues of million attributable to our accounts receivable financing product  businessmanager 
total receivables funded through businessmanager declined to billion in compared to billion in this decrease was primarily the result of fewer small businesses funding through businessmanager and fewer community financial institutions offering funding through businessmanager during as compared to  which we believe was due in part to a significant amount of turnover in the management and personnel of our sales force for this product 
although attrition rates for small businesses and client financial institutions were relatively stable  new sales to small businesses were lower than necessary to increase total participation fees 
this decrease was partially offset by  in fees from new product introductions and  related to the acquisitions of kvi capital and captiva  both of which we acquired during retail inventory management services 
retail inventory management services fees decreased to million for as compared to million for the decrease of  or  from was primarily a result of a decline in monthly forecast service fees of  due to a decrease in the number of forecast customers

no such charges were incurred during the year ended december  other operating income expense  net 
other operating income expense  net decreased significantly to operating income of  for the year ended december  from approximately  of expense for other operating expenses include property tax and other miscellaneous costs associated with providing support and services to our client financial institutions 
the decrease in is due to significant charges related to the million financing we completed with lightyear in january the january lightyear financing resulted in a significant charge of  related to the purchase of a tail directors and officers insurance policy that was required to be expensed immediately 
partially offsetting those two items in was a reduction in expense of approximately  due to the favorable conclusion of several state sales tax contingency matters

as a result of the above factors  our operating income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the previous year 
interest expense  net

as a result  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately in future periods 
critical accounting policies management has based this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates on a periodic basis 
a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
and other related generally accepted accounting principles 
we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service has been provided to the customer  the amount of fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable  and the collection of our fees is probable 
financial institution service fees 
we earn two types of participation fees 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the receivables that a client financial institution purchases from its small business customers during each month 
participation fees are recognized as earned  which is based upon the transaction dates of financial institution purchases from its small business customers 
we recognize insurance brokerage fee revenues when our financial institution clients purchase the accounts receivable covered by credit and fraud insurance policies and earn our fees based on a percentage of the premium paid to the insurance company 
we generate maintenance fees and other revenues from several ancillary products and services that we provide to our client financial institutions ratably over a month period beginning on the first anniversary of the agreement with our client 
for customers that install our core data processing system at their location  we recognize revenues from the installation and training for the system as we provide the installation and training services 
in addition  we charge an annual software maintenance fee  which we recognize ratably over the year to which it relates 
we recognize core data processing and image processing fees as we perform services for our clients 
we also generate revenues from the licensing of our core data processing systems 
we recognize revenue for licensing these systems in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition 
we recognize the software license after we have signed a non cancelable license agreement  have installed the products and have fulfilled all significant obligations to the client under the agreement 
our acquisition of goldleaf technologies added three primary products from which we earn revenues ach origination and processing  remote deposit  and website design and hosting 
we describe the current revenue recognition policies for these products below 
we account for the ach and remote deposit products in accordance with sop we license these products under automatically renewing agreements  which allow our customers to use the software for the term of the agreement  typically five years  and each renewal period 
typically  there is an up front fee  an annual or monthly maintenance and hosting fees for each year of the contract  and per originator and per transaction fees for processing of ach and remote deposit transactions 
we also offer training services on a per training day basis if the customer requests training 
during the second quarter of  we began the process of modifying goldleaf technologies ach and remote deposit contracts entered into after the january  acquisition date 
the primary modification allows customers of these products to take possession of the software for use on an in house basis versus the primary application service provider basis that goldleaf technologies had historically employed 
in accordance with the guidance provided in eitf no 
 application of aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored in another entity s hardware  this change in contractual terms results in a change in the applicable accounting literature from eitf to sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sops and under sop  if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe has been established for all undelivered elements  the residual method applies 
under the residual method  the fair value of each undelivered element is deferred  and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
therefore  in april  we began recognizing the up front fees when all of the revenue recognition criteria in paragraph of sop have been met  which is normally upon customer implementation 
revenue related to the undelivered elements is recognized as the services are delivered 
included in revenue for the year ended december  is approximately million related to up front fees for contracts entered into during had we not adopted this change  the total of million in additional revenue recognized in would have been spread over the estimated life of the client relationships  which is approximately months 
the effect of this change on how we recognize revenue from sales of these products in future years will be to accelerate the amount of revenue we recognize in each year in which we sell the products  although the precise amount will vary depending on the number and dollar amount of our contracts 
the annual maintenance fee covers telephone support and all unspecified software enhancements and upgrades 
the annual hosting fee covers the actual hosting of the software products on our servers  which are accessed by our customers 
we defer both the annual maintenance fees and the hosting fees and recognize them into income over the one year life of the maintenance and hosting agreements 
we recognize monthly maintenance and hosting fees on a monthly basis as earned and recognize transaction fees monthly as the transactions occur 
we recognize training revenue when we deliver the training services when delivered separately 
we offer financial institution website design services as well as hosting services for the website once design is complete 
we charge an up front fee for the design services and a monthly website hosting fee each month of the contract  which is typically five years 
the monthly hosting fee typically includes a limited amount of website maintenance hours each month 
we bill for any maintenance work exceeding the designated number of hours included in the monthly hosting fee at an agreed to hourly rate as the services are rendered 
we account for the website design and hosting services in accordance with eitf no 
during july  the company was able to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements the hosting and support services 
as a result  the up front fee for the design services is recognized at the time the customer website is completed and operational 
included in revenues are approximately  related to up front fees sold after the acquisition date for completed customer websites that had previously been deferred 
had the company not adopted this change  the total of  in additional revenue in would have been spread over the estimated life of the client relationships  which is approximately months 
the effect of this change on how the company recognizes revenue from sales of these products in future years will be to accelerate the amount of revenue it recognizes in each year in which it sells the products  although the precise amount will vary depending on the number and dollar amount of its contracts 
monthly hosting and maintenance revenues are recognized on a monthly basis as earned 
software license fees for our accounts receivable financing solution consist of two components a license fee and a client training and support fee 
we receive these one time fees on the initial licensing of our program to a client financial institution 
some agreements contain performance or deferred payment terms that must be met for us to receive payment and recognize revenue 
we recognize revenues from the license fee once we have met the terms of the client agreement 
we recognize the client training and support fee ratably over a four month service period after activation of the license agreement 
revenue recognition rules for up front fees are complex and require interpretation and judgment on the part of management 
each of our products containing software elements  including core data processing  ach processing  remote capture processing  accounts receivable financing and teller automation systems  requires the establishment of vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  for each element of the arrangement 
determining each element of an agreement and establishing vsoe can be complex 
if we modify our contract terms to an extent that changes our vsoe conclusions  our revenue recognition practices could be materially affected 
management completed a thorough analysis of the new client licenses for accounts receivable financing we obtained in and and concluded that we completed all services related to the up front fees in approximately four months 
as a result  effective january   we changed the estimated service period for recognition of the up front license fee from a twelve month to a four month revenue recognition period 
this change in assumptions resulted in an increase of approximately  in financial institution service fees during the quarter ended march  and increased financial institution service fees by  for the year ended december  we believe that this practice most accurately portrays the economic reality of the transactions 
we recognize leasing revenues for both direct financing and operating leases 
for direct financing leases  the investment in direct financing leases caption consists of the sum of the minimum lease payments due during the remaining term of the lease and unguaranteed residual value of the leased asset 
we record the difference between the total above and the cost of the leased asset as unearned income 
we amortize unearned income over the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of return on the net investment in the lease 
there is a significant amount of judgment involved in estimated residual values of leased assets at the inception of each lease 
management bases these estimates primarily on historical experience  however  changes in the economy or product obsolescence could adversely affect the residual values actually obtainable 
we monitor residual values quarterly to re assess the recorded amounts 
in the event our assumptions change regarding the amounts expected to be realized  we could incur substantial losses related to leased assets 
for leases classified as operating leases  we record the leased asset at cost and depreciate the leased asset 
we record lease payments as rent income during the period earned 
retail inventory management services we recognize revenues for our retail inventory management services as the transactions occur and as we perform merchandising and forecasting services 
other products and services revenues from other products and services consist of revenues from the sale of premium gifts related to our free checking product  our direct mail program  scanner device sales related to our remote deposit product  other ancillary hardware sales  and revenues from the sale of business forms 
we record revenues from our free checking direct mail campaign as the customer of our client financial institution opens a checking account and receives a premium gift 
we recognize revenues related to the hardware sales and business forms in the period that we ship them to the client financial institution 
software development costs we expense software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products as we incur those expenses until technological feasibility has been established 
after that point  we capitalize any additional costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
in addition  we capitalize the cost of internally used software when application development begins in accordance with aicpa sop no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  which is generally the point when we have completed research and development  we have established project feasibility  and management has approved a development plan 
many of the costs capitalized for internally used software relate to upgrades or enhancements of existing systems 
if the development costs will result in specific additional functionality of the existing system  we capitalize these costs at the point that application development begins 
we amortize capitalized software development costs on a straight line basis over their useful lives  generally three years 
the key assumptions and estimates for this accounting policy relate to determining when we have achieved technological feasibility and whether the project being undertaken is one that will be marketable or enhance the marketability of an existing product for externally marketed software and whether the project will result in additional functionality for internal use software projects 
management consults monthly with all project managers to ensure that management understands the scope and expected results of each project to make a judgment on whether a particular project meets the requirements outlined in the authoritative accounting literature described above 
there have been no significant changes in the critical assumptions affecting software development costs during any of the reporting periods presented in this prospectus 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the asset and liability method  meaning that deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we evaluate our ability to realize the deferred tax assets based on an assessment of the likelihood that we will have sufficient taxable income in future years to realize the recorded deferred tax assets 
deferred taxes for us primarily relate to nols  which require considerable judgment regarding whether we will ultimately realize them 
for us  this judgment relies largely on whether we expect to have sufficient taxable income in future years that will allow for full use of the nols we record 
in order to realize the nols recorded as a deferred tax asset at december   we will have to generate approximately million of taxable income in future periods 
our recent historical taxable income is not sufficient to meet this minimum level of pre tax profitability  however we do believe that future periods will provide sufficient taxable income levels to realize the recorded nols 
our recent historical results a number of significant one time non recurring charges  as well as  our operating performance has improved significantly due to our recent acquisitions 
the other key assumption affecting the amount of nols we record as a deferred tax asset is the estimated restriction in usage due to section of the internal revenue code 
section is very complex  requiring significant expertise and professional judgment to properly evaluate its effect on our usable nols 
we use an independent public accounting firm to assist with this evaluation and believe that we have appropriately considered the limitations required by section in arriving at the deferred tax asset for nols 
if our assumptions change  we could have significant increases in income tax expense and reductions in deferred tax assets and operating cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
requires a company to evaluate all uncertain tax positions and determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the positions 
we must adopt fin no 
beginning january  we are currently evaluating the requirements and impact  if any  of fin no 
on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations our business combinations require us to estimate the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in general  we determine the fair values based upon information supplied by the management of the acquired entities  which information we substantiate  and valuations using standard valuation techniques 
the valuations have been based primarily on future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
these future cash flow projections are highly subjective  and changes in these projections could materially affect the amounts calculated for intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisitions  we have recorded a significant amount of intangible assets including goodwill 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over their expected economic lives  generally ranging from three to ten years except for goodwill  which is not amortized 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we also perform an annual impairment test of goodwill at december we assess potential impairment through a comparison of the fair value of each reporting unit versus its carrying value 
the estimated fair value of goodwill and intangible assets is based on a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends  product development cycles and estimated future cash flows 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could cause a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth the elements of our cash flow statement for the following periods year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash from operating activities cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was attributable to depreciation and amortization expense of million  non cash stock compensation of million and the write off of debt issuance costs totaling million 
these amounts were partially offset by a net loss of million and a net decline in working capital assets and liabilities of  which was a result of an increase accounts receivable of million  an increase in prepaid and other current assets of  an increase in inventory of  and decreases in accounts payable of  and other noncurrent liabilities of  partially offset by an increases in accrued liabilities of million and deferred revenue of  cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was attributable to net income of million  depreciation and amortization expense of million and a deferred tax provision of  these operating cash flows were partially offset by a decline in working capital of  which was a result of an increase in prepaid and other current assets of  and a decrease in accrued liabilities of  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable of  cash provided by operations in the year ended december  was attributable to net income of million  depreciation and amortization of million  the write off of debt issuance costs of  and a deferred tax provision of million 
operating cash flows for were partially offset by an improvement in working capital of approximately  largely due to a decrease in accrued liabilities of million  partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid and other current assets of  and  respectively 
cash from investing activities cash from investing activities consists primarily of purchases of fixed assets  business acquisitions and capitalization of software development costs 
cash used in investing activities totaling million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of business acquisitions  lease receivable payments  purchases of fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs 
total capital expenditures  including software development costs  totaled million for the year ended december  theses expenditures primarily related to the purchase of computer equipment  computer software  software development activities  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
during the year ended december   we used approximately million to acquire the stock of goldleaf technologies and operating assets of ptc these cash uses were partially offset by  in net proceeds we received from our direct finance leases activities 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million 
total capital expenditures including capitalized software development costs were million for the year ended december  these expenditures primarily related to the purchase of computer equipment  computer software  software development activities  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  included million for the acquisition of captiva and  for the acquisition of kvi capital 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  totaled million consisting almost entirely of purchases of fixed assets and capitalization of software development costs 
cash from financing activities cash from financing activities primarily relates to borrowings paydowns on our credit facilities  the payment of preferred dividends  inflows from the sale of common stock  preferred stock  and new debt issuances 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million and was attributable primarily to proceeds received from the sale of million new common shares net of offering expenses totaling million and net new borrowings of approximately million from our amended and restated credit facility with bank of america 
we used substantially all of the offering proceeds to redeem all of our outstanding series a  b  and c preferred shares and warrants  which totaled approximately million 
we also paid off our term a  b  and c bank loans totaling million and repaid an outstanding note payable of  relating to the gti acquisition 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million and was attributable primarily to net additional borrowings of million offset by preferred dividends of million 
during  net cash used in financing activities was million and was attributable to the repayment of million in outstanding indebtedness and the payment of million of preferred dividends  partially offset by net proceeds of million from the sale of series a preferred stock and million from a new credit facility 
analysis of changes in working capital as of december   we had working capital of approximately million compared to working capital of approximately million as of december  the change in working capital resulted primarily from an increase in cash of million  an increase of million in accounts receivable  an increase of  in prepaid and other assets and a million increase in current deferred tax asset 
these increases were partially offset by increases in accounts payable of  accrued liabilities of million  deferred revenue of million and notes payable of  all of these changes were primarily the result of completing the goldleaf technologies acquisition on january  and the completion of our secondary offering in october we believe that the existing cash available  future operating cash flows and our amended and restated credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we expect to be in compliance with the financial covenants of our new credit facility throughout there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows to meet our obligations or that we will remain in compliance with the new covenants 
non compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
obligations and commitments for future payments as of december  the following is a schedule of our obligations and commitments for future payments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years years after in thousands revolving line of credit capital lease obligations non recourse lease notes payable operating leases notes payable total contractual cash obligations in the future  we may acquire businesses or products that are complementary to our business  although we cannot be certain that we will make any acquisitions 
the need for cash to finance additional working capital or to make acquisitions may cause us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot be certain that financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all  or that our need for higher levels of working capital will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in december  in connection with our acquisition of captiva  we amended the bank of america credit facility to convert it to a million revolving line of credit  and we issued a million unsecured senior subordinated note and common stock warrants to lightyear 
we paid lightyear a fee of  in connection with this transaction and agreed to reimburse lightyear for its legal fees up to  as of december   no amount was outstanding under the bank of america credit facility 
we were in compliance with all restrictive financial and non financial covenants contained in the bank of america credit facility throughout on january   we entered into an amended and restated million credit facility with bank of america 
we used the proceeds of the facility on january  to buy goldleaf technologies 
in connection with the january amendment and restatement of the bank of america credit facility the lightyear fund  lp  an affiliate of lightyear  guaranteed a million term loan included in the facility that was due july  and we agreed to pay a fee of  to the lightyear fund  lp and to reimburse the lightyear fund  lp for up to  of its expenses in connection with this guaranty  lightyear exchanged its senior subordinated million note for  shares of our series c preferred stock  which decreased our debt by million but added that same amount in redeemable preferred stock  and we amended and restated the common stock warrants that we issued to lightyear in december in connection with the lightyear note 
the series c preferred stock issued to lightyear had a mandatory redemption date of december  at a redemption price of million plus accrued and unpaid dividends  and had a annual dividend rate that would have increased to on june  as discussed elsewhere in this form k  on october   all of the series c preferred stock outstanding was redeemed with cash generated from our secondary common stock offering 
we subsequently amended the bank of america credit facility again in april to provide for an additional million in short term loans 
we further amended the bank of america credit facility in june to increase the total facility to million  consisting of the million term a note  the million term b note and a million revolving credit line 
the june amendment also eliminated the scheduled quarterly term a note payments of  on june    on both september  and december   and  per quarter thereafter until maturity 
on august   we again amended the bank of america credit facility to reduce the interest rate on the term b note from libor plus to libor plus 
we repaid the million outstanding under our credit facility with proceeds from our common stock offering and over allotment option discussed elsewhere in this form k 
upon repayment of the million outstanding  our credit facility converted automatically to a million revolving credit facility 
on november   we entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement with bank of america  na  the people s bank of winder  and wachovia bank  na the second amended and restated credit agreement amends and restates in its entirety the amended and restated credit agreement originally dated january   as amended and restated on january  and as further amended on february   april   may   june   and august  in the second amended and restated credit agreement and the form of the second amended and restated note the parties thereto agreed to certain changes from the existing credit agreement  including the following the credit facility was converted to a revolving credit facility in the amount of million  an increase of million over the previously existing credit facility  the maturity of the credit facility was extended from january  to november  with an option  conditioned upon the consent of the lenders  to extend the maturity for additional months  the funded debt to ebitda ratio under the credit facility was increased from times to times  wachovia bank  na joined as a participant in the credit facility  and the limit on capital expenditures in the credit facility was increased from million to million per fiscal year 
our bank of america credit facility contains financial covenants  including the maintenance of financial ratios and limits on capital expenditures 
we are required to maintain on a quarterly basis a ratio of funded debt  as defined and generally including all liabilities for borrowed money  to ebitda 
the definition of ebitda in the credit facility agreement is different from the one used elsewhere in this prospectus in that it permits to be added back to ebitda various specified amounts that include employee severance expenses  non cash debt amortization expenses  costs associated with the change of our corporate name  certain litigation expenses and non cash stock compensation expenses 
we are required to maintain on a quarterly basis a ratio of funded debt to ebitda not exceeding this ratio is calculated a at the end of each fiscal quarter  using the results of the twelve month period ending with the fiscal quarter and after giving pro forma effect to any acquisition made during such period and b on the date of any borrowing under the credit facility  using ebitda for the most recent period and funded debt after giving pro forma effect to such borrowing 
we are also required to maintain for the calendar month period ending on the last day of each calendar quarter  a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of in addition  we may not acquire fixed assets other than any equipment purchased by kvi capital with proceeds of non recourse loans having a value greater than million during any month period ending with each fiscal quarter 
the credit agreement also contains customary negative covenants  including but not limited to a prohibition on declaring and paying any cash dividends on any class of stock 
as of december   we were in compliance with all restrictive financial and non financial covenants contained in the bank of america credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which is an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
requires a company to evaluate all uncertain tax positions and determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the company must adopt fin no 
beginning january  we are currently evaluating the requirements and impact  if any  of fin no 
on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatement 
these methods are referred to as the roll over and iron curtain method 
the roll over method quantifies the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated 
exclusive reliance on an income statement approach can result in the accumulation of errors on the balance sheet that may not have been material to any individual income statement  but which may misstate one or more balance sheet accounts 
the iron curtain method quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
exclusive reliance on a balance sheet approach can result in disregarding the effects of errors in the current year income statement that results from the correction of an error existing in previously issued financial statements 
we currently use the roll over method for quantifying identified financial statement misstatements 
sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
sab allows registrants to initially apply the dual approach either by retroactively adjusting prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or by recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
use of this cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
our adoption of sab did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on september   the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this new standard provided guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities as required by other accounting standards 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which they reporting entity transacts 
sfas no 
must be adopted by the company effective january   although early application is permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the effects of sfas no 
upon adoption  however at this time it does not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material affect on its operating results or consolidated financial position 
in june  emerging issues task force eitf no 
was issued to address the treatment of taxes collected by various governmental authorities related to revenue transactions 
eitf no 
requires that all companies make an accounting policy decision as to whether such governmental taxes collected on revenue transactions are accounted for on a gross or net basis 
for companies that elect to account for these taxes on a gross basis  then disclosure of the amount included in revenues for each period is required 
eitf no 
is effective for periods beginning after december the company will adopt this rule effective january  and intends to account for all governmental taxes associated with revenue transactions on a net basis 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the effects of sfas no 
upon adoption  however at this time it does not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material affect on its operating results or consolidated financial position 
seasonality we have generally realized lower revenues and income in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter of the year 
we believe that this is primarily due to a general slowdown in economic activity following the fourth quarter s holiday season and  more specifically  a decrease in purchased receivables by our client financial institutions 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparison cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
due to the relatively fixed nature of costs such as personnel  facilities and equipment costs  a revenue decline in a quarter will typically result in lower profitability for that quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
currently  our exposure relates primarily to our long term debt obligations pursuant to the amended and restated bank of america credit facility 
as of december   our outstanding line of credit totaled million 
an increase of basis points under the bank of america credit facility will impact our future cash flows by approximately  annually
