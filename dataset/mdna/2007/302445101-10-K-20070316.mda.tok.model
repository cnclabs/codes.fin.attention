part i item business general we are a world leader in the design  manufacture and marketing of thermal imaging and infrared camera systems 
our products are used in a wide variety of applications in commercial  industrial and government markets  internationally as well as domestically 
we offer a variety of system configurations to suit specific customer requirements 
our business is organized into three divisions thermography  commercial vision systems and government systems 
thermography products are generally sold for commercial and industrial applications  generally where temperature measurement is the primary requirement 
our higher performance thermography cameras offer highly sensitive temperature measurement capability  sophisticated image processing and extensive analytic capabilities 
these cameras are commonly used for high end predictive and preventative maintenance  research and development  test and measurement  leak detection and scientific analysis 
our less expensive cameras offer excellent performance and value for applications such as predictive maintenance  damage restoration  building and home inspection  and energy auditing 
our thermography products range in price from  to over  we continue to expand the markets for our thermography products through the introduction of lower priced infrared camera systems  as well as through new products purposely built for specific applications 
in early we introduced the infracam low cost thermal imager at a price of  continuing our strategy of expanding the market for thermography products by introducing new  lower priced products to address emerging markets 
this product  combined with our thermacam e and b series and thermovision a series cameras  are targeted at markets such as commercial and residential building inspection  moisture detection and low cost process control applications  as well as helping to penetrate the more price and value conscious market sub segments of our core predictive maintenance marketplace 
our p series cameras are more sophisticated  higher performance units targeted at professional thermographers in such applications as predictive and preventative maintenance and power generation 
our gasfindir camera  introduced in  addresses the 
table of contents market for detection of natural gas and other volatile organic compounds in such industries as gas and petrochemical refining  transportation and storage 
most of our thermography products utilize uncooled infrared sensor technology described below and are designed and manufactured in stockholm  sweden 
in april  we announced the reorganization of our former imaging division into two new divisions  known as commercial vision systems and government systems 
commercial vision systems cvs is focused on emerging commercial markets for infrared imaging technology where the primary need is to see at night or in adverse conditions 
government systems gs will focus on traditional government end users in such applications as surveillance  force protection  drug interdiction  search and rescue  special operations and target designation 
as the cost of infrared technology has declined  demand in cvs markets has increased rapidly 
cvs was created to develop what we believe are large untapped markets for the use of infrared technology in such areas as commercial security  automotive  marine  airborne and first responder markets 
our infrared sensor business  which sells camera cores to third parties on an oem basis  is also a part of cvs 
cvs has focused its efforts on expanding distribution  accelerating design cycles  reducing manufacturing costs and providing excellent customer service in these markets 
cvs sells its products through a mix of direct  oem or third party distribution  depending on market dynamics 
in new markets such as maritime and commercial security  we have begun to establish networks of third party dealers with proven access to these markets 
in certain markets  such as firefighting and automotive  we sell products on an oem basis to well established companies with good access to the markets 
and in certain established markets such as electronic news gathering  we continue to sell direct 
most cvs products utilize our own uncooled infrared sensors 
prices for these sensors continue to decline rapidly  enabling us to continue to develop new lower priced products targeted at specific markets 
in  cvs introduced over new products for such markets as general aviation  recreational marine and commercial security 
cvs products range in price from under  for an oem imaging core to more than  for a high definition airborne electronic news gathering broadcast system 
we manufacture most of our cvs products at our factory in santa barbara  california 
cvs also sells products manufactured by our government systems division in portland  oregon  boston  massachusetts  and stockholm  sweden 
our government systems division offers a wide array of products  all of which allow the user to see in total darkness and through many types of obscurants such as smoke  haze and most types of fog 
we offer hand held imaging systems as well as fixed or vehicle mounted products specially designed for land  airborne and marine applications 
gs products are often customized for specific applications 
gs products are typically designed for high performance  and frequently incorporate additional sensors  including visible light cameras  low light cameras  laser rangefinders  laser illuminators and laser designators 
gs products range in price from  for our hand held and fixed security systems to over million for our most advanced stabilized laser designation systems 
we manufacture gs products in three locations portland  oregon large  stabilized systems  boston  massachusetts smaller stabilized systems  fixed mounted and hand held systems  and stockholm  sweden targeting and security cameras 
we compete on the basis of product performance  quality  features  customer service  training and price 
gs products are sold predominantly through our extensive direct sales force 
product development in our gs division is generally conducted either as commercial  off the shelf cots  or commercially developed  military qualified cdmq 
cots development is characterized by development of products for a range of government customers and markets that may also be sold into military applications 
cdmq refers to those circumstances where we develop products that are specifically designed to meet military specifications 
in both the cots and cdmq product development models  we use our own internally generated funds for research and development  and generally own all rights to the products and their 
table of contents design 
we have increased our emphasis on cdmq as a development strategy  and it is a growing part of our gs business 
we also periodically accept government funded design and development contracts 
during and  revenues from such contracts totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
our products utilize two types of infrared detectors 
our highest performance products  mostly sold through our gs business  utilize infrared detectors that are cooled to near absolute zero with a micro cooler 
this technique offers high sensitivity and resolution for long range applications or those requiring high measurement precision 
most of our thermography and cvs products utilize a detector technology that operates at or near room temperature and thus does not require a micro cooler 
this uncooled technology is lighter  uses less power and is less expensive to produce 
the performance of uncooled detectors has improved  and costs are dropping as production volumes increase 
we have built a worldwide system of direct sales personnel  dealers  distributors and oems that allows us to sell our products into a wide range of international and domestic markets 
in  of our revenue was derived from international sales 
international sales are generally subject to export licensing requirements by various agencies of the united states government 
these licensing requirements have and are from time to time likely to cause delays in the shipment of international orders and may prevent us from accepting orders in certain countries 
consolidated sales in to all agencies of the united states government totaled of our total revenue

infrared technology overview infrared is a portion of the electro magnetic spectrum that is not visible by the human eye because its wavelength is too long 
unlike visible light  infrared radiation or heat is emitted directly by all objects above absolute zero in temperature 
thermal imaging systems detect this infrared radiation and convert it into an electronic signal  which is then processed into a video signal and displayed on a video screen 
thermal imaging systems are different than other types of so called low light vision systems  such as visible light intensification used in night vision goggles 
unlike low light vision systems  thermal or infrared imaging systems can detect objects in total darkness  without any light source whatsoever  even through obscurants such as smoke  haze and most types of fog 
infrared imaging systems are not adversely affected by the presence of visible light  so they can be used day or night  and are not susceptible to rapid changes in visible light levels 
since infrared systems are detecting emitted infrared radiation  they are passive and thus more covert than certain illuminated systems 
finally  advanced thermal imaging systems can measure minute temperature differences  a critical tool for a variety of commercial  industrial and scientific applications 
an infrared detector  which absorbs infrared radiation and converts it into an electronic signal  is the primary component of thermal imaging systems 
the two primary types of infrared detectors are often referred to as cooled and uncooled 
cooled detectors  while more sensitive and thus able to see farther  require structures that result in a system that is heavier  more complex and uses more power than uncooled detectors 
conversely  uncooled detectors are lighter  less complex  and less expensive to produce  and use less power than cooled detectors 
the performance of uncooled technology is improving but is still less sensitive and has shorter range performance than cooled detectors 
we use both cooled and uncooled technology in our products  and expect demand for both types of systems to increase 
markets the company is divided into three main business segments  according to the markets served 
the thermography division produces systems that provide precise temperature measurement and thermal pattern and 
table of contents other diagnostic capabilities used for a variety of commercial  industrial and governmental applications including research  predictive maintenance  building inspection and electrical inspection 
key markets for our commercial vision systems division include commercial security  automotive  marine and other transportation night vision 
the government systems division addresses demand in large government markets for such applications as long range surveillance  reconnaissance  search and rescue  force protection and targeting 
financial information about geographic and segment operations appears in note to the consolidated financial statements in item thermography market 
the thermography market has traditionally addressed thermal imaging applications where both imaging and temperature measurement are required 
this market is growing in size and breadth as prices decline  volumes increase and new applications are found 
over the past several years  markets have expanded beyond the traditional industrial predictive and preventive maintenance segments  and we expect new markets to continue to develop in the future 
key end user markets today include predictive maintenance thermal imaging systems are used for monitoring the condition of mechanical and electrical equipment 
such monitoring allows for the detection of equipment faults manifested as hot spots so they can be repaired before they fail 
this increases the equipment s productivity and avoids catastrophic failures or major equipment damage  which reduces operating expenses by lowering repair costs and reducing downtime 
improved functionality of image analysis software  smaller size and weight  and simplicity of system operation are critical factors for this well established market segment 
research development infrared s unique ability to detect minute differences in temperature while detailing complex thermal dynamics and patterns makes thermography systems a useful tool in a wide variety of research and development applications 
as industry is driven to make smaller  lighter and more powerful electronic products  the problem of dealing with self generated heat is becoming increasingly difficult 
our systems provide the ability to view thermal distribution in real time for products ranging in size from small hybrid integrated circuits to jet engines 
common applications include product development of microelectronics  cell phones  laptop computers  telecommunications equipment  consumer appliances  automotive components and aircraft engines 
systems used in research and development applications typically require very high imaging performance and measurement precision  coupled with extensive analysis and reporting software 
manufacturing process control the ability to determine whether a manufacturing process will produce acceptable results at the earliest point in the production cycle is critical to quality assurance and cost reduction 
thermal imaging and image analysis allow for the monitoring and control of heat  which is used in virtually all industrial processes 
similarly  thermal imaging systems can identify moisture and contaminants and help identify the thickness of material as well as the integrity of the bonding of composite materials 
many processes that cannot be monitored visually because of obscurance from smoke or steam are readily visible using infrared imaging 
thermal imaging applications for manufacturing process control include monitoring the quality of metal  plastic and glass cast parts  which are highly dependent upon the temperature distribution in the 
table of contents mold  monitoring the quality of paper  which is dependent upon proper and even moisture distribution during the drying process  and monitoring the quality of products such as rubber gloves  which can be thermally examined to locate abnormally warm or cool spots  indicating non uniform thickness that may result in a quality defect 
building inspection we offer products specifically designed to address the requirements of the building inspection market 
infrared imagers can detect missing insulation  electrical faults  water intrusion  pest infiltration  gauge energy efficiency  and help detect the presence of mold 
emerging thermography our infracam  introduced in early  continues a process begun by our thermacam e series and thermovision a series products to expand traditional thermography markets and open new markets for our products 
infracam has met with strong market acceptance in the lower end building and electrical inspection markets  where smaller manufacturing facilities  electrical cooperatives and electrical contractors that could not justify the cost of a high end product have purchased infracam and e series cameras to replace paid consultancy services 
our a series fixed mounted infrared cameras are now deployed into manufacturing environments where they can help improve quality and give operators the ability to see through smoke and steam in harsh industrial environments  such as metal shredding and pulp and paper processing 
we expect additional market segments for thermal imaging to develop due to the lower cost and enhanced performance characteristics of uncooled thermal imaging technology 
as system prices decline  thermal imaging technology will offer solutions for a wide variety of new commercial applications 
these may include healthcare  food service and distribution  veterinary science  automotive care  aircraft inspection  maritime vessel inspections and plumbing 
commercial vision systems market 
our commercial vision systems division is focused on commercial markets where the primary need is to see at night  and in adverse conditions 
these markets are broad  relatively immature with low penetration of infrared technology and require distinct distribution channels 
as in thermography  price elasticity of demand is high  and as prices continue to decline we expect volumes to rise rapidly 
significant markets today include perimeter security thermal imaging systems have historically been used for ground based surveillance and perimeter security of government  military and industrial facilities  particularly at night 
recently  we have introduced a series of lower price  purpose built systems targeted at the commercial security market and are actively expanding distribution in this market 
automotive night vision we have entered into an agreement with autoliv electronics  a major supplier of safety equipment to the automotive industry  to offer a night vision system for passenger automobiles 
in late  bmw began offering a night vision system utilizing our camera as an option in the   and series automobiles 
the system provides 
table of contents drivers with the ability to see at night and through obscurants  such as fog  at distances much further than can be seen by traditional headlights 
in cities and at other short distances  the system aids in identifying pedestrians  animals and other potential hazards 
with our partner autoliv  we are seeking to expand this technology to other automakers 
other transportation night vision we are actively marketing our products in other transportation markets  such as trucks  trains  recreational vehicles  and first responder vehicles 
these markets are in the early stages of adoption of infrared technology  but we believe they offer significant future growth opportunities

our customers are located around the world and are serviced by a global distribution organization covering more than countries 
a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from sales to us and foreign government agencies and our business will continue to be substantially dependent upon such sales 
aggregate sales to us government agencies accounted for of our revenue in  in and in sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of revenue in  in and in we expect non us revenue to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue 
further information about geographic operations and customers appears in note to the consolidated financial statements in item sales and distribution we believe our sales and distribution organization is among the largest in the industry and effectively covers the world with a combination of direct sales  independent representatives and distributors  dealers  application engineers  service and training centers 
our sales personnel  including third party distributors  undergo a comprehensive training program on each product s technical specifications  functions and applications 
we also continuously update our training programs to incorporate technological and competitive shifts and changes 
we sell to many distinct markets  and have established specific sales channels for each market 
we sell our thermography products worldwide through a direct sales staff and a network of distributors and representatives 
our thermography business continues to expand distribution  particularly in asia and latin america 
at the end of  our thermography division had over direct sales personnel and approximately distributors 
commercial vision systems is also actively expanding its distribution network by hiring additional direct sales personnel and expanding third party distribution networks in specific markets

included in this total are technical and customer support staff in the united states and europe who provide application development  technical training and operational assistance to direct and indirect sales personnel as well as to customers 
marketing with our further expansion into the low cost segment of the commercial markets  we have developed greater competencies in market research  electronic marketing  marketing communications and business development 
our ability to identify new markets  tune our product solutions to meet unique market needs  quickly develop marketing communications that highlight these unique features  and leverage existing and new distribution channels to develop incremental business are important aspects of our marketing and communications efforts 
we focus our product marketing activities on internet promotion  advertising  direct mail  press tours  technical articles for publications and participation in most major trade shows in our industry 
these activities 
table of contents give us the opportunity to educate potential customers about the key features and attributes of our products and how they may be used to address specific customer needs 
customer service we maintain service facilities at our factories in portland  oregon  boston  massachusetts  santa barbara  california  stockholm  sweden  and london  united kingdom  and at our locations in antwerp  belgium  frankfurt  germany  toronto  canada  paris  france  milan  italy  hong kong  and sao paulo  brazil 
each of our service facilities has the capability to perform the complex calibrations required to service commercial thermal imaging systems 
we employ approximately people worldwide in our service organizations 
we also maintain field service capabilities in five additional foreign locations under the direction of our independent representatives or distributors 
backlog at december  and  we had an order backlog of million and million respectively 
backlog is defined as orders received for products or services for which a sales agreement is in place and delivery is expected within twelve months 
backlog is greatest relative to future revenue in our government systems division  which is characterized by long lead times and relatively large orders  and least in thermography business  which essentially ships products as purchase orders are received 
commercial vision systems carries backlog in certain markets  but is less backlog dependent than government systems 
backlog for the government systems business is heavily dependent upon the timing of receipt of government contracts that may have multiple year delivery schedules 
furthermore  delivery schedules are frequently revised to accommodate changes in customer needs 
although orders received by us are generally subject to cancellation  in the case of most orders included in backlog  the customer is generally obligated to pay certain costs and or penalties for cancellation 
manufacturing we manufacture many of the critical components for our products  including infrared detectors  gimbals  optics and coatings  laser sub systems and micro coolers 
this vertical integration minimizes lead times  facilitates prompt delivery of our products  controls costs and ensures that these components satisfy our quality standards 
we purchase other parts pre assembled  including certain detectors  certain coolers and optics  circuit boards  cables and wiring harnesses 
these components are then assembled into finished systems and tested at one of our production facilities 
we have invested in automated production equipment for our thermography manufacturing facility in stockholm to support the volume demands now generated by the growth of our thermography business 
this automation includes robotic cell calibration capabilities that have increased unit throughput 
we design and manufacture many of our own cooled and uncooled infrared detectors 
previously  we purchased our cooled detectors from three separate third party suppliers  and purchased our uncooled detectors under an exclusive arrangement with one supplier 
we believe this vertical integration has allowed us to continue to obtain high quality uncooled and cooled detectors  at lower cost  while providing better control over future detector design 
we have maintained third party sources of supply for all types of detectors as well 
we purchase certain other key components from sole or limited source suppliers 
accordingly  we could experience late deliveries or a scarcity in the supply of some of these components 
our manufacturing operations are  from time to time  audited by certain original equipment manufacturer customers  which include several major aircraft manufacturers  and have been certified as meeting their quality standards 
our facilities in portland  boston  stockholm  london  bozeman  orlando and santa barbara are iso certified 

table of contents competition competition in the market for thermal imaging equipment is significant 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are performance  price  customer service  product reputation and effective marketing and sales efforts 
our competitors are different in each market segment 
in the thermography market  principal competitors include fluke a division of danaher corporation  nec san ei  cedip and mikron instruments 
competitors in commercial vision systems vary market by market  but include l communications  nvti  cedip  axsys  icx and emx 
in the government systems market  our competitors include raytheon corporation  bae systems  l communications  drs corporation  lockheed martin corporation  el op  sagem  tamam and thales 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
proprietary rights we have numerous patents  trademarks  trade secrets and other intellectual property that are important for our success 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
we believe that our historical success has been primarily a function of other competitive advantages such as the skill and experience of our employees  our worldwide  multi channel sales  distribution and servicing network and our name recognition and quality products 
because intellectual property protection does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal imaging industry  we cannot be certain or give any assurance that we can maintain this competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop similar or superior capabilities 
employees as of december   we had  employees of which were in the united states and were outside of the united states 
we have been generally successful in attracting highly skilled technical  marketing and management personnel to date 
none of our employees in the united states are represented by a union or other bargaining group 
employees in sweden are represented by unions whose contracts are subject to periodic renegotiations 
we believe our relationships with our employees and unions are good

risk factors the following are important factors that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements made by or on behalf of the company 
in addition  you should know that the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
unforeseen risks could arise and problems or issues that we now view as minor could become more significant 
if we were unable to adequately respond to any risks  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
additionally  we cannot be certain or give any assurances that any actions taken to reduce known risks and uncertainties will be effective 
fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results make it difficult to predict our future performance 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
due to these fluctuations  we believe that 
table of contents quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
factors that may affect our future operating results include the timing  number and size of orders from  and shipments to  our customers  as well as the relative mix of those orders  variations in the volume of orders for a particular product or product line in a particular quarter  a significant portion of our sales are made in the last month of each quarter  with sales frequently concentrated in the last week or days of the quarter  the timing and market acceptance of our or our competitors new products  product enhancements or technologies  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of critical components  the timing of the release of government funds for procurement of our products  changes in our or our competitors pricing policies  our ability to collect on trade receivables  the timing and amount of any inventory write downs  foreign currency fluctuations  the ability to secure export licenses for international sales orders  costs and risks associated with the acquisition and integration of other businesses  product lines or technologies  and general economic conditions  both domestically and internationally 
seasonal fluctuations in our operating results  particularly the increase in sales we generally experience every year in the fourth quarter  result from the seasonal pattern of contracting by the united states government and certain foreign governments  the frequent requirement of international customers to take delivery of equipment prior to january due to funding considerations  and the tendency of commercial enterprises to fully utilize annual capital budgets prior to expiration 
we may be unable to successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions  into our operations  thereby disrupting our business and harming our financial condition and results of operations 
we have made numerous acquisitions of various sizes during our history 
our most recent acquisitions include scientific materials corporation and brysen optical corporation during and indigo systems corporation in the indigo acquisition was large and significant effort was required to integrate indigo s operations into ours 
while we believe this integration has been successful  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in integrating future acquisitions 
this integration of businesses  personnel  product lines and technologies is typically difficult  time consuming and subject to significant risks 
for example  we could lose key personnel from companies that we acquire  incur unanticipated costs  lose major sources of revenue  fail to integrate critical technologies  suffer business disruptions or incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses 
any of these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and decrease our revenue 
it is possible that we will make additional acquisitions in the future 
any future acquisitions are subject to the risks described above 
furthermore  we might assume or incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities to pay for future acquisitions 
additional debt may negatively impact our results and increase our 
table of contents financial risk  and the issuance of any additional equity securities could dilute our then existing shareholders ownership 
we frequently evaluate strategic opportunities available to us and may in the near or long term pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses  product lines or technologies 
no assurance can be given that we will realize anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions  or that any such acquisition or investment will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on our ability to respond to the rapid technological change in the markets in which we compete 
the thermal imaging industry is characterized by rapid technological developments and frequent new product introductions  enhancements and modifications 
our ability to develop new technologies that anticipate changing customer requirements  reduce cost and otherwise retain or enhance our competitive position will be an important factor in our future results from operations 
we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures and incur significant research and development costs to improve our manufacturing capability  reduce costs and develop and introduce new products and enhancements 
if we fail to develop and introduce new technologies in a timely manner  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we may experience impairment in the value of our tangible and intangible assets our industry is subject to rapid changes in technology  which may result in unexpected obsolescence or impairment of our assets 
as of december   our intangible assets  including goodwill  totaled million and represented of our total assets 
most of these intangibles are the result of acquisitions in which the total purchase price exceeded the value of the tangible assets acquired 
we amortize certain of these intangibles over their anticipated useful life  and review goodwill for impairment annually 
to date we have not experienced any impairment of our intangible assets  but there can be no assurance that we will not experience such impairment in the future 
in addition  certain of our tangible assets such as inventory and machinery and equipment may experience impairment in their value as a result of such events as the introduction of new products  changes in technology or changes in customer demand patterns 
we depreciate our machinery and equipment at levels we believe are adequate  however there can be no assurances that there will not be a future impairment that may have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we must successfully introduce new or enhanced products  enter into new markets and manage the costs associated with producing numerous product lines to be successful 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to improve our existing products and to develop new products using the latest technology that can satisfy customer requirements 
we entered several new markets in  including the automotive  recreational marine and low cost thermography markets  and expect these and other new markets to generate significant revenue in the future 
the long term success of these products cannot be assured 
we are also investing a significant percentage of our resources on research and development with the objective of developing new products or enhancing existing products 
we cannot be certain that our new products and product enhancements will be successful or that customers will accept any of our new products 
in addition  the complexity associated with developing and maintaining multiple product lines may inhibit our ability to maintain or improve our profitability and may require significant management time and effort to effectively manage 
our failure to complete the enhancement of these products  the failure of our current or future products to gain or maintain market acceptance or our failure to successfully manage our cost of production could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the markets for thermal imaging equipment is intense and our failure to compete effectively would adversely affect our business 
competition in the markets for our products is intense 
the speed with which companies can identify new applications for thermal imaging  develop products to meet those needs and supply commercial quantities at low 
table of contents prices to the market are important competitive factors 
we believe the principal competitive factors in our markets are product features  performance  reliability and price 
additionally  our products compete indirectly with numerous other products  such as image intensifiers and low light cameras  for limited governmental and military funds 
finally  many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  research and development and marketing resources than we do 
all of these factors as well as the potential for increased competition from new competitors requires us to continue to invest in  and focus on  research and development and new product innovation 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to compete effectively in the future  and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers of components for our products exposes us to risks that could result in delays in satisfying customer demand  increased costs and loss of revenue 
we currently rely on a number of sole source and limited source suppliers to provide certain key components for our products 
we have increased our internal sources of supply for certain critical components  in particular cooled and uncooled infrared detectors  optics and optical coatings  and laser components 
we rely on numerous sole or limited source third party suppliers for various key components including laser designators and rangefinders  certain machined parts  optics  motors and electronic components 
many of these suppliers are small and we are often one of their most important customers 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in the event that we are unable to source certain of these components on a timely basis or if such components are defective or they do not otherwise meet our performance standards 
based on past experience  we expect to occasionally receive late deliveries or to experience inadequate supplies of certain components 
if critical components provided by any significant supplier become unavailable  our manufacturing operations would be disrupted 
unless we have sufficient lead time and are otherwise able to identify and qualify acceptable replacement components or redesign our products with different components  we might not be able to obtain necessary components on a timely basis or at acceptable prices 
any extended interruption in the supply of sole or limited source components would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct operations abroad  and the united states congress may prevent proposed sales to foreign governments 
export licenses are required from united states government agencies under the export administration act  the trading with the enemy act of and the arms export control act of for export of many of our products 
we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining these licenses 
recently  heightened government scrutiny of export licenses for products in our market has resulted in lengthened review periods for our license applications 
failure to obtain or delays in obtaining these licenses would prevent or delay us from selling our products outside the united states and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to reduce our costs quickly enough if our sales decline 
our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future sales  and these expenses are largely fixed  particularly in the short term 
in addition  to enable us to promptly fill orders  we maintain inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials 
as a result  we commit to considerable costs in advance of anticipated sales 
accordingly  we may not be able to reduce our costs in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall between forecasted and actual sales 
any significant shortfall of sales may result in us carrying higher levels of inventories of finished goods  components and raw materials thereby increasing our risk of inventory obsolescence and corresponding inventory write downs and write offs 

table of contents our future success depends in part on attracting and retaining key senior management and qualified technical and sales personnel 
our future success depends in part on the efforts and continued services of our key executives and our ability to attract and retain qualified technical and sales personnel 
significant competition exists for such personnel and we cannot assure the retention of our key executives  technical and sales personnel or our ability to attract  integrate and retain other such personnel that may be required in the future 
all key personnel  excluding those located in california  have signed non competition agreements which limit their ability to join companies that directly or indirectly compete with us 
we cannot  however  assure that employees will not leave and subsequently compete against us 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have indebtedness as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities and the sale of our convertible notes 
we have a million credit agreement which was signed on october  under which we had million outstanding as of december  additionally  in june  we issued million of senior convertible notes due in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of as a result of this indebtedness  our principal and interest payment obligations have increased 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we face risks from international sales and currency fluctuations 
we market and sell our products worldwide and international sales have accounted for  and are expected to continue to account for  a significant portion of our revenue 
for the years ended december  and  international sales accounted for and  respectively  of our total revenue 
our international sales are subject to a number of risks  including the imposition of governmental controls  restrictions on the export of critical technology  trade restrictions  difficulty in collecting receivables  inadequate protection of intellectual property  labor union activities  changes in tariffs and taxes  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  political and economic instability  and general economic conditions 
historically  currency fluctuations have affected our operating results 
changes in the value of foreign currencies in which our sales are denominated or costs incurred have in the past caused  and could in the future cause  fluctuations in our operating results 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations by denominating  where possible  our international sales in us dollars 
with respect to international sales denominated in united states dollars  a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar could make our products less price competitive 
no assurance can be given that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and operations and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products may suffer from defects or errors leading to substantial damage or warranty claims 
we include complex system designs and components in our products that may contain errors or defects  particularly when we incorporate new technology into our products or release new versions 
while we have not 
table of contents yet had to recall a product  if any of our products are defective  we might be required to redesign or recall those products or pay substantial damages or warranty claims 
such an event could result in significant expenses  disrupt sales and affect our reputation and that of our products  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  product defects could result in substantial product liability 
we maintain product liability insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms 
our inability to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and avoid infringing the rights of others could harm our competitive position and our business 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth depends  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing the rights of others 
to accomplish this  we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
many of our proprietary rights are held in confidence as trade secrets and are not covered by patents  making them more difficult to protect 
although we currently hold united states patents covering certain aspects of our technologies and products  and we are actively pursuing additional patents  we cannot be certain that we will obtain additional patents or trademarks on our technology  products and trade names 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that our patents or trademarks will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors 
likewise  we cannot be certain that measures taken to protect our proprietary rights will adequately deter their misappropriation or disclosure 
any failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moreover  because intellectual property does not necessarily represent a barrier to entry into the thermal imaging industry  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our competitive advantage or that competitors will not develop capabilities equal or superior to ours 
litigation over patents and other intellectual property is common in our industry 
we cannot be sure that we will not be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
defending intellectual property lawsuits and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort of our personnel 
an adverse determination in a patent suit or in any other proceeding to which we may be a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
additionally  an adverse determination could require us to seek licenses from third parties 
if licenses were not available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  our business could be harmed 
we would be harmed if we were unable to use one of our facilities 
we manufacture our products at various facilities as described in item our inability to continue to manufacture our products at one or more of our facilities as a result of  for example  an earthquake  a prolonged power outage  fire or other natural disaster  would prevent us from supplying products to our customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we maintain business interruption insurance but cannot be certain that it is adequate or will remain available on acceptable terms 
oregon law and our charter documents contain provisions that could discourage or prevent a potential takeover  even if the transaction would benefit our shareholders 
other companies may seek to acquire or merge with us 
an acquisition or merger of our company could result in benefits to our shareholders  including an increase in the value of our common stock 
some provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  including our shareholder rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock without further action by our shareholders  as well as provisions of oregon law  may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable
