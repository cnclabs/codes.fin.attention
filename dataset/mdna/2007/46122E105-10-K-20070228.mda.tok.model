item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and other financial information included in this annual report on form k for the years ended december   and introduction we currently manage three operating segments inventiv clinical  inventiv communications and inventiv commercial  and its non operating reportable segment  other  which is based on the way management makes operating decisions and assesses performance 
the following represents our reportable segments inventiv clinical  which provides services related to permanent placement  clinical staffing  data collection and management and functional outsourcing 
inventiv communications  which provides services related to pharmaceutical advertising  branding  interactive communication development and patient and physician education 
inventiv commercial  which consists of our outsourced sales and marketing teams  planning and analytics services  sample accountability and patient assistance businesses  marketing support services  professional development and training  and recruitment of sales representatives in the commercial services area 
our business is heavily dependent on the willingness and propensity of our customers to seek outsourced solutions for the services we provide 
we believe that our business has been positively affected by a trend of large pharmaceutical manufacturers toward utilizing outsourcing arrangements as a means of controlling variable unit cost and increasing flexibility 
although large contracts with these manufacturers remain an important component of our overall business activity  there is a potential for margin contraction and the termination of contracts resulting from downsizing and other cost control measures by large pharmaceutical manufacturers 
we believe that the increasing percentage of new drug application nda and new molecular entity nme approvals attributable to small and mid tier pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies presents an opportunity for companies providing outsourced services because these companies often prefer to employ high quality  third party service providers either directly or in co promotion situations with pharmaceutical partners to effect critical late stage developmental and commercialization functions  rather than building significant infrastructure internally 
we therefore target a broad spectrum of companies within the pharmaceutical and life sciences industry in seeking to develop business opportunities 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the following is a summary of our revenue recognition policy  based on the segment and services we provide inventiv clinical clinical staffing and recruiting revenues are recognized and recorded when services are rendered 
functional outsourcing revenues are recognized and recorded when milestones are achieved  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
executive placement revenues are recognized and recorded at the time a candidate begins full time employment 
any write offs due to cancellations and or billing adjustments historically have been insignificant 
inventiv communications advertising and communication support revenues are recognized and recorded under the proportional performance method  by relating the actual hours of work performed to date to the current estimated total hours of the respective projects 
any anticipated losses on projects are recognized when such losses are anticipated 
time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
branding consultation revenues are recognized and recorded on a fee for service basis  in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
patient and physician education revenues are recognized and recorded using either the completed contract method or when milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the specific contracts 
interactive communication development revenues are recognized and recorded as time and production billings are billed as incurred for actual time and expenses 
inventiv commercial sales and marketing teams revenues and associated costs are recognized and recorded under pharmaceutical detailing contracts based on the number of physician calls made or the number of sales representatives utilized 
most of our sales and marketing teams contracts involve two phases  a deployment phase  typically three months  in which we perform initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the promotion phase in which our deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients through face to face interactions with physicians referred to as detailing 
our inventiv pharma teams contracts specify a separate fee for the initial deployment phase of a project 
we consider the deployment phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognize the related revenues throughout the deployment phase  which typically spans a period of two to three months at the beginning of the first year of a contract 
we generally recognize revenue during the promotion phase of our inventiv pharma teams contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
the accounting for the two phases is based on our analysis of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  in which we have concluded that the deployment and promotion phases are being sold separately and therefore qualify as separate units of accounting within the meaning of paragraph of eitf many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue from incentive fees is recognized and recorded when we are reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
non refundable conversion fees are recognized and recorded as revenue when one of our sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
planning and analytics revenues for hpr generally include fixed fees  which are recognized and recorded when monthly services are performed based on the proportional performance method and when payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year 
revenues for additional services are recognized and recorded when the services are provided and payment is reasonably assured 
regulatory compliance and patient assistance regulatory compliance revenues for both fixed fees services and fees for specific compliance related services are recognized and recorded when monthly services are performed 
patient assistance programs revenues depend on the number of patients served and are recognized and recorded as each service is performed 
marketing support services revenues are recognized and recorded based on time incurred and fulfillment requirements in accordance with the terms of the contracts 
professional development and training revenues are generally recognized and recorded as training courses are completed 
general revenue recognition reimbursable costs reimbursable costs  including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to individual or product revenues  and other similar costs  are generally included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services in the period in which such amounts have been finalized 
in certain cases  based on our analysis of eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and related accounting literature  we may also record certain reimbursable transactions  such as the placement of media advertisements where we act as an agent  as net revenues 
loss contracts we periodically analyze our contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product  field force or other performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  we accrue that loss at the time it becomes probable 
we did not have any material loss contracts in  or billing customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as client advances and unearned revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon billing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled services 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles are assessed for potential impairment pursuant to the guidelines of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis at june or when management determines that the carrying value of goodwill or an indefinite lived intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of certain indicators of impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of a reporting unit 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
we calculate and compare the fair value of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
if we deem the useful life to be no longer indefinite after testing for impairment in accordance with the applicable rules stated above  we amortize the intangible asset over its remaining estimated useful life  following the pattern in which the expected benefits will be consumed or otherwise used up and we continue to review for impairment on an annual basis 
we performed annual impairment tests as of june  and concluded that the existing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible tradename balances were not impaired and continue to maintain this position as of december   based on various factors  including updated forecasts and the current condition of the company 
as of december   we had goodwill of approximately million and other intangibles net of million in the consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards no 
r share based payments sfas r  establishes accounting for share based awards exchanged for employee services and requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of these awards over the requisite employee service period 
on april   the us securities and exchange commission adopted a new rule amending the effective dates for sfas r 
in accordance with the new rule  we adopted the accounting provisions of sfas r as of january  we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method beginning january  accordingly  during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense for awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under fas were in effect for expense recognition purposes  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for stock based awards granted after january   we recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the black scholes valuation model 
for these awards  compensation expense was recognized using a ratable amortization method 
with the adoption of sfas r in  we have limited our issuance of stock options to senior executives  while granting restricted shares to employees at various levels 
during the fourth quarter of  prior to the adoption of sfas r  management analyzed its expected volatility and expected life of stock options and concluded that the expected volatility for options granted during the fourth quarter of should be and the expected life of the options granted should range between and years  depending on the grantee s employee status 
in  we analyzed historical trends in these variables on a quarterly basis  resulting in a decrease in our expected volatility to during the fourth quarter of  while the range of the expected term remained at to years 
for the year ended december  we elected to use the simplified method of determining the expected term as permitted by sab the range of the expected term remained unchanged at to years 
we continue to base the estimate of risk free rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  and have certain restrictions under its credit facility to pay dividends and thus have assumed a dividend yield 
stock based compensation for the year ended december  has been reduced for estimated forfeitures based on an estimated forfeiture rate of 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider voluntary termination behaviors as well as trends of actual option forfeitures 
these conclusions were based on several factors  including past company history  current and future trends  comparable benchmarked data and other key metrics 
claims and insurance accruals we maintain self insured retention limits for certain insurance policies 
the liabilities associated with the risk we retain are estimated in part based on historical experience  third party actuarial analysis  demographics  nature and severity  past experience and other assumptions 
the liabilities for self funded retention are included in claims and insurance reserves based on claims incurred  with liabilities for unsettled claims and claims incurred but not yet reported being actuarially determined with respect to workers compensation and auto liability claims and estimated based on management s evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and historical experience with respect to all other liabilities 
a significant number of these claims typically take several years to develop and even longer to ultimately settle 
these estimates tend to be reasonably accurate over time  however  the actual liabilities could vary materially from management s estimates and assumptions regarding severity of claims  medical cost inflation  as well as specific case facts can create short term volatility in estimates 
management believes that these reserves are adequate 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is established  when necessary  to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
realization is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income of a specific nature prior to the expiration of any loss carryforwards or capital losses 
the asset may be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
in addition  we maintain reserves for certain tax items  which are included in income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet 
we periodically review these reserves to determine if adjustments to these balances are necessary 
derivative financial instruments effective october  we entered into an amortizing three year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million at inception to apply a fixed interest rate against the six year million loan arrangement entered into to facilitate the acquisition of inventiv communications  inc we entered into this interest rate swap agreement to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt 
at the inception of the hedged item s designation  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
from october to july  we did not qualify for hedge accounting and recorded a million reduction to interest expense relating to the mark to market adjustment  and a corresponding derivative asset of approximately million  which was recorded in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of the interest rate swaps were obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
on july   we formally designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we employed the dollar offset method by performing a shock test to assess ineffectiveness and utilized the hypothetical derivative model to measure ineffectiveness 
the hypothetical derivative contains the same terms and conditions as the original derivative  but was initiated in july from july to december  the fair market value of the derivative asset decreased to approximately million  resulting in a million decrease in the derivative asset  approximately million approximately million  net of taxes adjustment to other comprehensive income  and million of interest expense due to ineffectiveness of the hedged item

we conducted an internal review of its uncertain tax positions resulting from the adoption of fin the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
discontinued operations for the year ended december  and  earnings from discontinued operations  net of taxes  were approximately million and million  respectively 
the gains on disposals of discontinued operations mainly consisted of contingency payments due from our previously divested germany based unit 
in addition  approximately million of tax liability was reversed since the receivership of the previously divested france based unit was finalized during the fourth quarter of net income and earnings per share eps inventiv s net income increased by approximately to million  from net income of million in the year ended december  and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share increased to earnings of per share for the from earnings of per share for operating results were higher due to increased results in inventiv communications and the new acquisitions  offset by stock based compensation expense recorded as a result of adopting sfas r 
earnings per share were also affected because of approximately million additional shares outstanding in over year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december   mainly due to increased business in our inventiv commercial business and company acquisitions during and  as more fully described below 
as a result of the fourth quarter acquisitions in inventiv clinical  the segment has contributed approximately million of revenues in and million of revenues for the year ended december  the key driver of increased business was due to increased hiring in permanent placement and clinical staffing

there were also two acquisitions franklin in june and prs in august  which contributed to the increase in revenues 
cost of services cost of services increased by approximately million or  to million during the year ended december  from million in the year ended december   mainly due to increased business in our inventiv commercial business and company acquisitions during and  as mentioned previously 
cost of services decreased as a percentage of revenues to from in the year ended december  and  respectively 
the and acquisitions in the inventiv clinical and inventiv communications segments generally tend to have higher margins than the inventiv commercial group due to the nature of the services provided 
inventiv clinical s cost of services in was approximately million  compared to approximately million during the fourth quarter of  when the segment was established via the smith hanley and hhi acquisitions 
cost of services as a percentage of revenues was in line from the previous year

cost of services at the inventiv commercial business increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this variance percentage is lower than the percentage increase in revenue between the related periods 
cost of services was of inventiv commercial revenue in the year ended december   compared to in the year ended december  the decrease of cost of services as a percentage of revenue in as compared to was attributable to ongoing cost savings measures implemented by management to align our support and infrastructure with the current level of operations 
in addition  we acquired franklin in june  as described previously  which is a higher margin division than the core commercial services business 
sg a sg a expenses increased by approximately million  or  to million from million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to increased compensation levels in versus  sg a expenses incurred at the divisions acquired in and  increases in professional fees related to increased acquisitions and compliance with the internal control standards of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the hiring of an internal audit department in sg a expenses at our inventiv clinical business units  which were acquired during the fourth quarter of  were approximately million during the year ended december   compared to million during the fourth quarter of sg a expenses at our newly acquired inventiv communications businesses were approximately million in  which reflects expenses incurred during the fourth quarter  when the acquisition of inventiv communications  inc was consummated 
sg a expenses at inventiv commercial increased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million incurred in the year ended december  this increase was due to increased compensation and benefits in versus  mainly due to increased results during  million of additional sg a at franklin  which was acquired in june  and additional sg a at prs  which was acquired in august other sg a was approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or from million for the year ended december  the increase was mainly related to increases in compensation as a result of improved company performance  professional fees primarily related to increased acquisitions and our compliance with the internal control standards of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and the hiring of an internal audit department in due to increased acquisitions over the last two years  our internal and external audit expenses have increased substantially from provision for income taxes in march  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million primarily related to prior period tax contingencies  which are no longer required 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million primarily related to the reversal of a previously recorded valuation allowance as the company determined an additional portion of its deferred tax asset was more likely than not expected to be realized 
including these tax benefits  our annual effective tax rate was in during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million primarily related to the divestiture and shutdown of certain former subsidiaries 
our tax rate during the fourth quarter benefited additionally from million of net federal state tax adjustments and other one time reversals  primarily related to prior period tax contingencies  which are no longer required

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk long term debt exposure at december   we had million debt outstanding under our unsecured term loan 
see liquidity and capital resources section for further detail on our credit agreement 
we will incur variable interest expense with respect to its outstanding loan 
this interest rate risk may be partially offset by our derivative financial instrument  as described below 
based on our debt obligation outstanding at december   a hypothetical increase or decrease of in the variable interest rate would have an immaterial effect on interest expense due to the fixed rate associated with the derivative financial instrument 
derivative financial instrument effective october  we entered into an amortizing three year interest rate swap arrangement with a notional amount of million at inception to apply a fixed interest rate against the six year million loan arrangement entered into to facilitate the acquisition of inchord 
we entered into this interest rate swap agreement to modify the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding long term debt 
at the inception of the hedged item s designation  and at least quarterly thereafter  we assess whether derivatives used to hedge transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flow of the hedged item 
to the extent the instruments are considered to be effective  changes in fair value are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
to the extent there is any hedge ineffectiveness  changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion are immediately recognized in earnings interest expense 
from october to july  we did not qualify for hedge accounting and recorded a million reduction to interest expense relating to the mark to market adjustment  and a corresponding derivative asset of approximately million  which was recorded in deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of the interest rate swaps were obtained from dealer quotes 
these values represent the estimated amount we would receive or pay to terminate the agreement taking into consideration the difference between the contract rate of interest and rates currently quoted for agreements of similar terms and maturities 
on july   we formally designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we employed the dollar offset method by performing a shock test to assess ineffectiveness and utilized the hypothetical derivative model to measure ineffectiveness 
the hypothetical derivative contains the same terms and conditions as the original derivative  but was initiated in july from july to december  the fair market value of the derivative asset decreased to approximately million  resulting in a million decrease in the derivative asset  approximately million approximately million  net of taxes adjustment to other comprehensive income  and million of interest expense due to ineffectiveness of the hedged item
