item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we continue to pursue a strategy of increasing market share in existing and surrounding geographic markets through internal growth and selective acquisition of local and regional companies 
in addition  we will continue to expand into new geographic markets on a selective basis  either through acquisition or by opening new operating centers  when we believe it will enhance our business 
our focus remains primarily on oxygen and other respiratory therapy services  which represent approximately of our revenues 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lincare holdings inc and its subsidiaries 
we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to prepare these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
revenue recognition our revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period in which services and related products are provided to customers and are recorded at net realizable amounts estimated to be paid by customers and third party payors 
insurance benefits are assigned to the company and  accordingly  the company bills on behalf of its customers 
the company s billing system contains payor specific price tables that reflect the fee schedule amounts in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
certain items provided by the company are reimbursed under rental arrangements that generally provide for fixed monthly payments established by fee schedules for as long as the patient is using the equipment and medical necessity continues subject to capped rental arrangements which limit the rental payment periods in some instances and which may result in a transfer of title to the equipment at the end of the rental payment period 
once initial delivery of rental equipment is made to the patient  a monthly billing cycle is established based on the initial date of delivery 
the company recognizes rental arrangement revenues ratably over the monthly service period and defers revenue for the portion of the monthly bill which is unearned 
no separate payment is earned from the initial equipment delivery and setup process 
during the rental period we are responsible for servicing the equipment and providing routine maintenance  if necessary 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with the criteria set forth in staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition sab for determining when revenue is realized or realizable and earned 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the requirements of sab that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
due to the nature of the industry and the reimbursement environment in which we operate  certain estimates are required to record net revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values at the time products and or services are provided 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that they will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
specifically  the complexity of many third party billing arrangements and the uncertainty of reimbursement amounts for certain services from certain payors may result in adjustments to amounts originally recorded 
such adjustments are typically identified and recorded at the point of cash application  claim denial or account review 
included in accounts receivable are earned but unbilled receivables 
unbilled accounts receivable represent charges for equipment and supplies delivered to customers for which invoices have not yet been generated by the billing system 
prior to the delivery of equipment and supplies to customers  we perform certain certification and approval procedures to ensure collection is reasonably assured and that unbilled accounts receivable are recorded at net amounts expected to be paid by customers and third party payors 
billing delays  ranging from several weeks to several months  can occur due to delays in obtaining certain required payor specific documentation from internal and external sources  interim transactions occurring between cycle billing dates established for each customer within the billing system and business acquisitions awaiting assignment of new provider enrollment identification numbers 
in the event that a third party payor does not accept the claim for payment  the customer is ultimately responsible 
we perform analyses to evaluate the net realizable value of accounts receivable 
specifically  we consider historical realization data  accounts receivable aging trends  other operating trends and relevant business conditions 
because of continuing changes in the health care industry and third party reimbursement  it is possible that our estimates could change  which could have a material impact on our operations and cash flows 
bad debt expense  sales adjustments and related allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
the majority of our accounts receivable are due from medicare  medicaid and private insurance carriers  as well as from customers under co insurance provisions 
third party reimbursement is a complicated process that involves submission of claims to multiple payors  each having its own claims requirements 
in some cases  the ultimate collection of accounts receivable subsequent to the service dates may not be known for several months 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
the company has established an allowance to account for sales adjustments that result from differences between the payment amounts received from customers and third party payors and the expected realizable amounts 
actual adjustments that result from such differences are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or when otherwise determined pursuant to the company s collection procedures 
we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  and aging of accounts receivable 
our proprietary management information systems are utilized to provide this data in order to assess bad debts 
in the event that collection results of existing accounts receivable are not consistent with historical experience  there may be a need to establish an additional allowance for doubtful accounts  which may materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
business acquisition accounting and amortization expense the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  provide guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles for business acquisitions 
we apply the purchase method of accounting for business acquisitions  and use available cash from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and the assumption of certain liabilities as the consideration for business acquisitions 
we allocate the purchase price of our business acquisitions based on the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets 
the difference between the total cost of the acquisition and the sum of the fair values of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
until the end of  goodwill was amortized over a period of years 
the assignment of a year life was based on each acquisition s ability to generate sufficient operating results to support the recorded goodwill balance 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
which required that goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized and instead be tested annually for impairment 
accordingly  no amortization expense related to goodwill has been recorded in the financial statements since we assess the impairment of intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include  without limitation  i significant under performance of acquired assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  ii significant changes in the manner or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii significant negative industry or economic trends  iv increased competitive pressures  v a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and vi technological and regulatory changes 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and long lived assets may be impaired  we evaluate the ability to recover those assets 
if those assets are determined to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
contingencies we are involved in certain claims and legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles related to contingencies 
we evaluate and record liabilities for contingencies based on known claims and legal actions when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the liability can be reasonably estimated 
we have concluded that accrued liabilities related to contingencies are appropriate and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
net revenues the following table sets forth for the periods indicated a summary of our net revenues by product category year ended december  in thousands oxygen and other respiratory therapy   home medical equipment and other    total    net revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  an increase of above net revenues for the increase in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth partially offset by reductions in medicare reimbursement of 
the medicare reimbursement reductions for inhalation drugs and related dispensing fees and oxygen equipment that were effective in reduced net revenues in the year by approximately million see medicare reimbursement 
net revenues for the year ended december  decreased by million  a decrease of below net revenues for the decrease in net revenues in was comprised of internal growth and acquisition growth offset by reductions in medicare reimbursement of 
the medicare reimbursement reductions for inhalation drugs  oxygen equipment and dme that were effective in reduced net revenues in by million 
the internal growth in net revenues is attributable to underlying growth in the market for our products estimated at annually and increased market share resulting primarily from our sales and marketing efforts that emphasize high quality equipment and customer service 
growth in net revenues from acquisitions is attributable to the effects of acquisitions of local and regional companies and is estimated based on the contribution to net revenues for the four quarters following such acquisitions 
during and  we completed the acquisition of businesses with annual revenues of approximately million and businesses with annual revenues of approximately million  respectively 
the contribution of oxygen and other respiratory therapy products to our net revenues was  and  respectively  for the years ended december   and our strategy is to focus on the provision of oxygen and other respiratory therapy services to patients in the home and to provide home medical equipment and other services where we believe such services will enhance our core respiratory business 
cost of goods and services cost of goods and services as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the relationships of costs to net revenues during the periods were impacted by the medicare price reductions discussed above see net revenues 
the increase in cost of goods and services in and is attributable primarily to increased patient and drug shipment volumes and an increase in drug purchasing costs due to a product mix shift to higher cost branded products in our inhalation drug product line 
we also experienced significant growth in our sleep therapy product lines during  which generally carry a lower gross margin than other products we provide 
cost of goods and services includes the cost of equipment excluding depreciation  drugs and supplies sold to patients and certain operating costs related to the company s respiratory drug product line 
these costs include an allocation of customer service  distribution and administrative costs relating to the respiratory drug product line of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively

the increases in operating expenses during the periods compare favorably to the increases in net revenues from internal growth and  respectively and acquisitions and  respectively before considering the effects of the medicare price reductions 
gains in productivity at our operating centers and modest growth in office rent and related facility expenses helped to offset higher freight charges due to gains in customer shipment volumes in our drug and sleep accessory product lines and significant vehicle related cost increases attributable to higher fuel prices and vehicle lease expenses 
the company manages over operating centers from which customers are provided equipment  supplies and services 
an operating center averages approximately seven to eight employees and is typically comprised of a center manager  two customer service representatives referred to as csr s telephone intake  scheduling  documentation  two or three service representatives referred to as service reps delivery  maintenance and retrieval of equipment and delivery of disposables  a respiratory therapist non reimbursable and discretionary clinical follow up with the customer and communication to the prescribing physician and a sales representative marketing calls to local physicians and other referral sources

bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the years ended december   and days sales outstanding dso were days at december   up from days and days at december  and  respectively 
the increase in dso in is attributable primarily to disruptions caused by a transition in the contractors that process medicare claims see medicare reimbursement  an increase in acquired accounts receivable balances from business acquisitions and growth in our sleep therapy product line  which generally has a higher mix of managed care and commercial insurance payors than our traditional medicare business 
our net accounts receivable balance as of december  was also impacted by the adoption by the company of the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
during the fourth quarter of which resulted in the company recording an allowance for sales adjustments of million see new accounting standards and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
while we have achieved consistent results in managing bad debt expense over the past three years  continued growth in the pace of our acquisition program may contribute to an increase in our bad debt expense in the future 
the integration of acquired companies into our regional billing and collections offices may temporarily disrupt collections  increasing the amount of accounts receivable written off as uncollectible 
depreciation expense as a percentage of net revenues was for the year ended december  compared with and for the years ended december  and  respectively

amortization expense in january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill resulting from business acquisitions completed after june  has not been amortized 
goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from business acquisitions before july  have been amortized through december  goodwill and certain intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment 
the provisions of sfas no 
apply to all business combinations completed after june  during  we amortized million of intangible assets compared with million in and million in our net intangible assets were billion as of december  of this total  million consisting of various covenants not to compete is being amortized over periods of one to seven years 
operating income as shown in the table below  operating income for the year ended december  decreased million when compared to the prior year 
the decrease in operating income in is attributable to several factors  including the million negative impact on our net revenues resulting from reduced medicare payment rates for inhalation drugs and related dispensing fees that took effect on january  and the reduction of medicare reimbursement rates for oxygen equipment that took effect on april   and higher reported sg a expenses due to the required adoption of sfas no 
r and the resulting recognition of million of stock based compensation expense during the year 
the decrease in operating income in is attributable primarily to the reduction of medicare reimbursement rates for inhalation drugs and certain items of dme effective january   decreased reimbursement rates for oxygen equipment that took effect on april  and increased costs of purchased inhalation drugs  partially offset by customer volume growth  gains in labor productivity and control over operating costs 
we estimate that the reductions in medicare reimbursement rates reduced net revenues and operating income in by approximately million 
year ended december  in thousands operating income    percentage of net revenues interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
in  the company acquired  in unrelated acquisitions  certain operating assets of local and regional companies resulting in the addition of new operating centers 
additionally  the company purchased the remaining equity interests in two companies in which we had previously acquired partial ownership 
the aggregate cost of these acquisitions was million and was allocated to acquired assets as follows million to current assets  million to property and equipment  million to separately identifiable intangible assets  and million to goodwill 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been internally generated funds from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and proceeds from equity and debt transactions 
we have used these funds to meet our capital requirements  which consist primarily of operating costs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service 
at december   our working capital was million  as compared to million at december  the decline in working capital is primarily attributable to our use of million to repurchase shares of our common stock in net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  a significant portion of our assets consists of accounts receivable from third party payors that are responsible for payment for the equipment and services we provide 
our dso was days as of december  and days as of december  we measure our dso by dividing our net accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by the product of our latest quarterly net revenues times four  multiplied by days 
net cash used in investing and financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
activity in the year ended december  included our investment of million in business acquisitions  net investment in capital equipment of million  payments of debt of million  proceeds of million from exercise of stock options and issuance of common shares and million in payments to acquire treasury stock 
as of december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and million available under our revolving credit agreement 
the revolving credit agreement  dated december   makes available to us up to million over a five year period  subject to certain terms and conditions set forth in the agreement 
the million revolving credit agreement replaced the company s million credit facility that was due to expire in april of as of december   there was million of borrowings and million of standby letters of credit issued under the new credit facility 
on october   the board of directors authorized a plan to repurchase up to million of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased million of its common stock pursuant to the plan 
total common stock held in treasury at cost was million at december  during the second fiscal quarter of  the company retired all of its common shares held in treasury and has subsequently retired all common shares upon repurchase on the open market 
on february   the board authorized a new share repurchase plan whereby the company may repurchase  from time to time  on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  shares of the company s common stock in amounts determined pursuant to a formula that takes into account both the ratio of the company s net debt to cash flow and its available cash resources and borrowing availability 
on january   the board approved a modification to the formula to increase the ratio of net debt to cash flow available to fund share repurchases 
on june   we completed the sale of million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures in a private placement 
the debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock based on a conversion rate of shares for each  principal amount of debentures 
this is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
on june   we sold an additional million principal amount of debentures pursuant to the exercise in full of an over allotment option granted to the initial purchasers of the debentures 
the debentures are convertible into common stock in any calendar quarter if  among other circumstances  the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least trading days during the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our previous calendar quarter is greater than or equal to of the applicable conversion price per share per share of our common stock on such last trading day 
interest on the debentures is payable at the rate of per annum on june and december of each year 
the debentures are senior unsecured obligations and will mature on june  the debentures are redeemable by us on or after june  and may be put to us for repurchase on june     or our future liquidity will continue to be dependent upon our operating cash flow and management of accounts receivable 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with our current cash on hand and funds available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  fund anticipated acquisitions and capital expenditures  and meet our contractual obligations for at least the next months 
accounts receivable the company maintains payor specific price tables in its billing system that reflect the fee schedule amounts statutorily in effect or contractually agreed upon by various government and commercial payors for each item of equipment or supply provided to a customer 
due to the nature of the health care industry and the reimbursement environment in which lincare operates  situations can occur where expected payment amounts are not established by fee schedules or contracted rates  and estimates are required to record revenues and accounts receivable at their net realizable values 
inherent in these estimates is the risk that revenues and accounts receivable will have to be revised or updated as additional information becomes available 
contractual adjustments to revenues and accounts receivable can result from price differences between allowed charges and amounts initially recognized as revenue due to incorrect price tables or subsequently negotiated payment rates 
actual adjustments that result from differences between the payment amount received and the expected realizable amount are recorded against the allowance for sales adjustments and are typically identified and ultimately recorded at the point of cash application or account review 
historically  such sales adjustments have not been significant and we report revenues in our financial statements net of such adjustments 
accounts receivable are reported net of allowances for sales adjustments and uncollectible accounts 
bad debt is recorded as an operating expense and consists of billed charges that are ultimately deemed uncollectible due to the customer s or third party payor s inability or refusal to pay 
the company s payor mix is highly concentrated among medicare  medicaid and other government third party payors and contracted private insurance or commercial payors 
government payment rates are determined according to published fee schedules established pursuant to statute  law or other regulatory processes and commercial payment rates are based on contractual line item pricing as reflected in the respective contracts 
fee schedule updates have historically occurred on a prospective basis and have been made available to the company in advance of the effective date of a change in reimbursement rates 
the company s proprietary billing system has features that allow the company to timely update payor price tables within the system as changes occur in order to accurately record revenues and accounts receivable at their expected realizable values 
additional systems and manual controls and processes are used by management to evaluate the accuracy of these recorded amounts 
based on the company s experience  it is unlikely that a change in estimate of unsettled amounts from third party payors would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or results of operations 
accounts receivable balance concentrations by major payor category as of december  and december  were as follows percentage of accounts receivable outstanding december  december  medicare medicaid other government private insurance self pay total aged accounts receivable balances by major payor category as of december  and december  were as follows percentage of accounts aged in days december  over medicare medicaid other government private insurance self pay all payors percentage of accounts aged in days december  over medicare medicaid other government private insurance self pay all payors the company operates regional billing and collection offices rbcos that are responsible for the billing and collection of accounts receivable 
the rbcos are aligned geographically to support the accounts receivable activity of the operating centers within their assigned territories 
as of december  and  there were  and  full time employees in the rbcos 
accounts receivable collections are performed by designated collectors within each of the rbcos 
the collectors use various reporting tools available within the company s proprietary billing system to identify claims that have been denied or partially paid by the responsible party and claims that have not been processed by the third party payor in a timely manner 
collections of accounts receivable are typically pursued using direct phone contact to determine the reason for non payment and  if necessary  corrected claims are prepared for resubmission and further follow up with the responsible party 
in some cases  third party payors have developed electronic inquiry methods that the company can access to determine the status of individual claims 
the company has benefited from the increasing availability of electronic funds transfers from payors  which now account for approximately of all payments received 
the company believes that its collection procedures contribute to its accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso and bad debt expense being among the lowest in its industry  according to published industry data and public filings of some of its competitors 
the ultimate collection of accounts receivable may not be known for several months 
we record bad debt expense based on a percentage of revenue using historical company specific data 
the percentage and amounts used to record bad debt expense and the allowance for doubtful accounts are supported by various methods and analyses including current and historical cash collections  bad debt write offs  aged accounts receivable and consideration of any payor specific concerns 
the ultimate write off of an accounts receivable occurs once collection procedures are determined to have been exhausted by the collector and after appropriate review of the specific account and approval by supervisory and or management employees within the rbcos 
management and rbco supervisory and management employees also review accounts receivable write off reports  correspondence from payors and individual account information to evaluate and correct processes that might have contributed to an unsuccessful collection effort 
the company does not use an aging threshold for account receivable write offs 
however  the age of an account balance may provide an indication that collection procedures have been exhausted  and would be considered in the review and approval of an account balance write off 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
future minimum obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into obligations and commitments that require future contractual payments 
the commitments primarily result from repayment obligations for borrowings under our revolving bank credit facility and debentures  as well as contractual lease payments for facility  vehicle  and equipment leases and deferred acquisition obligations 
the following table presents  in aggregate  scheduled payments under our contractual obligations in thousands fiscal years thereafter total short term debt   capital lease commitments long term debt   interest expense    operating leases      employment agreements     total     amounts represent debentures due the debentures are redeemable by us on or after june  and may be put to us for repurchase on june     or the debentures are shown in the table as scheduled for repurchase in as a result of the put feature
