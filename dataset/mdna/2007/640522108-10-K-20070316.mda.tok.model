item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of next generation therapeutic proteins that we believe will be competitive with best in class protein drugs currently on the market 
our lead therapeutic protein candidates are ne and glycopeg gcsf 
in  the epo and g csf drug categories had aggregate worldwide sales of approximately billion and billion  respectively 
ne is a long acting version of epo produced in insect cells 
epo is prescribed to stimulate production of red blood cells  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia and anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
ne is being developed for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with non myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy and for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease  including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis 
during  we completed a phase i clinical trial for ne in switzerland 
in january  we received approval from swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  for the initiation of a phase ii human trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability and dose response of ne in cancer patients receiving platinum based chemotherapy 
in march  we received clearance from the us food and drug administration fda to initiate clinical trials in the us in response to our amended investigational new drug application ind 
our second proprietary protein  glycopeg gcsf  is a long acting version of g csf that we are co developing with biogenerix ag  a company of the ratiopharm group 
g csf is prescribed to stimulate production of neutrophils a type of white blood cell and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of neutropenia associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
in november  biogenerix initiated the first of two planned phase i clinical trials for glycopeg gcsf 
we expect biogenerix to initiate and complete the second phase i trial during we believe that our enzymatic pegylation technology  glycopegylation  can improve the drug properties of therapeutic proteins by building out  and attaching peg to  carbohydrate structures on the proteins 
we are using our technology to develop proprietary versions of protein drugs with proven safety and efficacy and to improve the therapeutic profiles of proteins being developed by our partners 
we expect these modified proteins to offer significant advantages  
table of contents including less frequent dosing and possibly improved efficacy  over the original versions of the drugs now on the market  as well as to meet or exceed the pharmacokinetic profile of next generation versions of the drugs now on the market 
we believe this strategy of targeting drugs with proven safety and efficacy allows us to lower the risk profile of our proprietary development portfolio as compared to de novo protein drug development 
we intend to continue to focus our research and development resources on therapeutic proteins that we believe have the highest probability of clinically meaningful therapeutic profile improvements from our technology and are in commercially attractive categories 
in march  we sold million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock through a private placement  including million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock to investment funds affiliated with certain members of our board of directors  at a price of per unit  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants have a five year term and an exercise price of per share 
in march  we initiated a restructuring of operations designed to allow for significantly higher clinical development costs for ne  while keeping anticipated net cash spending consistent with levels 
the restructuring  which will be implemented over the next few months  will result in a workforce reduction of approximately 
we estimate that we will incur cash restructuring costs of approximately million  most of which will be reflected in our operating results during the first half of we have not yet determined if we will incur any contract termination or non cash impairment charges in connection with the restructuring 
in september  we sold our witmer road facility for approximately million 
we owned the witmer road facility subject to mortgages supporting our term loan and industrial development authority bond 
after payment of selling fees and expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
concurrent with the closing  we repaid outstanding debt associated with the facility and related equipment of approximately million  which included accrued interest and prepayment penalties 
the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the witmer road facility of approximately million will be used to further our research  preclinical development  and clinical development objectives and to fund the capital expenditures described below to the extent such expenditures are not financed through the issuance of new debt 
in conjunction with the sale of the witmer road facility  we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately employees 
we anticipate cash severance and retention costs of approximately million  of which million had been paid as of december  in february  we consolidated our operations into our rock road facility  a  square foot facility that we currently lease in horsham  pennsylvania 
we anticipate total costs for construction of additional laboratory and office space in the rock road facility of approximately million  of which million was included in construction in progress as of december  we have incurred operating losses each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect additional losses over the next several years as we continue product research and development efforts and expand our intellectual property portfolio 
we have financed our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and revenues from our collaborative agreements 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our march financing  expected proceeds from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through the second quarter of  although changes in our collaborative relationships or our business  whether or not initiated by us  may cause us to deplete our cash and cash equivalents sooner than the above estimate 
liquidity and capital resources overview we had million in cash and cash equivalents as of december   compared to million as of december  the decrease for was primarily attributable to the use of cash to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and debt repayments  which were partly offset by net proceeds received from the sale of the witmer road facility 
in march  we sold million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of our common stock at per unit  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants have a five year term and an exercise price of per share 

table of contents the development of next generation proprietary protein therapeutics  which we are pursuing both independently and in collaboration with selected partners  will require substantial expenditures by us and our collaborators 
we plan to continue financing our operations through private and public offerings of equity securities  proceeds from debt financings  and proceeds from existing and future collaborative agreements 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 
other than proceeds from our collaborations with novo nordisk and biogenerix  and any future collaborations with others  we do not expect to generate significant revenues until such time as products using our technologies are commercialized  which is not expected during the next several years 
we expect an additional several years to elapse before we can expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operating and investing requirements 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents including the net proceeds from our march financing  expected revenue from collaborations and license arrangements  and interest income should be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements at least through the second quarter of accordingly  we will need to raise substantial additional funds to continue our business activities and fund our operations until we are generating sufficient cash flow from operations 
if we are unable to raise additional capital when required  we may need to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities during and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease of million in net cash used in operating activities during was substantially the result of a million reduction in research and development costs from to in addition  during  million of cash was provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities compared to million for fluctuations in operating items vary period to period due to  among other factors  the timing of research and development activities  such as the initiation and progress of clinical trials and non clinical studies 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities during was million  compared to net cash used in investing activities during of million 
in september  we sold our witmer road facility for approximately million 
after payment of selling fees and expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
concurrent with the closing  we repaid outstanding debt associated with the facility and related equipment of approximately million  which included accrued interest and prepayment penalties 
the remaining net proceeds from the sale of the witmer road facility of approximately million will be used to further our research  preclinical development  and clinical development objectives and to fund the capital expenditures described below to the extent such expenditures are not financed through the issuance of new debt 
in february  we consolidated our operations into our rock road facility 
we anticipate total costs for construction of additional laboratory and office space in our rock road facility of approximately million  of which million was included in construction in progress as of december  during and  cash expenditures for property and equipment were million and million  respectively 
the improvements to our rock road facility contributed significantly to our capital expenditures during in  we expect our investment in capital expenditures to be approximately million to million  which includes approximately million to complete the construction at our rock road facility 
we may finance some or all of these capital expenditures through capital leases or the issuance of new debt or equity 
the terms of any new debt could require us to maintain a minimum cash and investments balance  or to transfer cash into an escrow account to collateralize some portion of the debt  or both 
financing activities equity financing activities in march  we sold million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock through a private placement  including million shares of common stock and warrants to purchase million shares of common stock to investment funds affiliated with certain members of our board of directors  at a price of per unit  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants have a five year term and an exercise price of per share 

table of contents in february  we offered and sold million shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share  generating net proceeds of million 
in may  we sold million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering to a number of institutional and individual investors  including million shares sold to officers and an investment fund affiliated with a director  at a price of per share  generating net proceeds of million 
debt financing activities our total debt decreased by million to million at december   compared to million at december  this decrease primarily resulted from million of early repayments of principal in connection with the sale of our witmer road facility in september during  we also made planned debt principal repayments of million  which were partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of debt to finance insurance policy premiums 
note payable secured by insurance policies in march  we borrowed million to finance insurance policy premiums due on certain insurance policies 
we made the last payment in november  and  therefore  there was no outstanding principal balance under this agreement as of december  the interest was calculated based on an annual percentage rate of 
to secure payment of the amounts financed  we granted the lender a security interest in all of our right  title and interest to the insurance policies 
term loan from bank and industrial development authority bond in september  we repaid the outstanding balance of the term loan from a bank and the industrial development authority bond in connection with the sale of the witmer road facility 
in connection with these repayments  we incurred million of prepayment penalties and included this amount in interest expense during term loan from landlord in may  we borrowed million from the landlord of our rock road facility in horsham  pennsylvania 
as of december   we owed the landlord million 
the terms of the financing require us to pay monthly principal and interest payments over months at an interest rate of 
during  we expect to make principal and interest payments totaling million under this agreement 
notes payable to equipment lender as of december   we owed million to an equipment lender that financed the purchase of certain equipment and facility improvements  which collateralize the amounts borrowed 
we made million of early principal repayments in september upon the closing of the sale of the witmer road facility 
in connection with these early principal payments  we incurred million of prepayment penalties and included this amount in interest expense during in october  we amended six promissory notes with our equipment lender in connection with the early repayment of a portion of the outstanding debt as a result of the sale of the witmer road facility 
under the amended promissory notes  our last payment is scheduled for september  and interest rates applicable to the equipment loan range from to 
during  we expect to make principal and interest payments totaling million under these agreements 
capital lease obligations we did not enter into any agreements with capital lease obligations during and we entered into agreements with capital lease obligations during for equipment with a value of million 
the terms of existing leases require us to make monthly payments through august as of december   the present value of aggregate minimum lease payments under these agreements was million 
during  we expect to make lease payments totaling  under these agreements 
operating leases we lease laboratory  office  warehouse facilities  and equipment under operating lease agreements 
in  we entered into a lease agreement for our rock road facility 
the initial term of this lease ends  at which time we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five years  followed by another option to extend the lease for an additional four and one half years 
this lease contains escalation clauses  under which the base rent increases annually by 
we lease 
table of contents approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in horsham  pennsylvania under a lease agreement that expires april in january  we entered into a five year lease agreement for approximately  square feet of office and warehouse space in horsham  pennsylvania to replace similar space subject to the expiration described above 
our rental expense was million for each of the years ended december    and summary of contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts as of december  payments due by period less than total year years years after years long term debt obligations debt maturities contractual interest capital lease obligations debt maturities contractual interest operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations see financing activities debt financing activities in this liquidity and capital resources section and note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for a description of the material features of our long term debt

off balance sheet arrangements we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a focuses on our liquidity  capital resources  and financial statements 
the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are developed and adjusted periodically by management based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents our summary of significant accounting policies is described in note of the notes to financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
management considers the following policies and estimates to be the most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial position  and cash flows 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this md a 
revenue recognition we have entered into collaborative agreements with other companies for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable up front license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of development milestones  and royalties on product sales 
license fees and multiple element arrangements non refundable license fees are recognized as revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
multiple element arrangements  such as license and development arrangements are analyzed to determine whether the deliverables  which often include a license and performance obligations  such as research and development services  can be separated or whether they must be accounted for as a single unit of accounting in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
if the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined  such obligations would then be accounted for separately as performed 
however  if the license is considered to either i not have stand alone value or ii have stand alone value but the fair value of any of the undelivered performance obligations cannot be determined  the arrangement would then be accounted for as a single unit of accounting and the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed 
in our collaborative arrangements with novo nordisk and biogenerix  we have determined the license to each does not have stand alone value 
whenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting  we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue will be recognized 
significant management judgment is required in determining the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement 
substantive milestone payments our collaboration agreements may also contain substantive milestone payments 
substantive milestone payments are considered to be performance bonuses that are recognized upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone involves a degree of risk and was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  a reasonable amount of time passes between the up front license payment and the first milestone payment as well as between each subsequent milestone payment  and the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
determination as to whether a payment meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the resulting payment would not be considered a substantive milestone  and therefore the resulting payment would be considered part of the consideration for the single unit of accounting and be recognized as revenue as such performance obligations are performed 

table of contents reimbursement of research and development costs reimbursement of research and development costs is recognized as revenue provided the provisions of eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  are met  the amounts are fixed and determinable  and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
in our collaborative arrangements with novo nordisk and biogenerix  we recognize revenue as such costs are incurred because we have evidence of fair value for these delivered items 
deferred revenue amounts received prior to satisfying the above revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
determination as to the classification of deferred revenue as current or long term on our balance sheets involves management s judgment 
for example  in connection with our existing collaboration agreements  we have recorded on our balance sheet current and long term deferred revenue based on our best estimate of when such revenue will be recognized 
the current portion of deferred revenue consists of amounts that are expected to be recognized as revenue during amounts that we expect will not be recognized during are classified as long term deferred revenue 
this estimate is based on our estimate of the periods of our involvement in certain of our collaborations 
in certain instances  the timing of satisfying these obligations can be difficult to estimate 
accordingly  our estimates may change in the future 
any change to the estimated performance period would be recognized on a prospective basis 
if these estimates and judgments change over the course of these agreements  it may affect the timing and amount of revenue that we recognize and record in future periods 
stock based employee compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  effective january  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values at the date of grant 
prior to january   we followed accounting principles board apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method for adopting sfas no 
r 
under this method  the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption and to that portion of awards not fully vested as of the date of adoption 
accordingly  prior periods have not been restated 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is the same model we previously utilized for valuing stock options for footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure sfas no 

the fair value of share based awards is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures 
we rely primarily on historical experience to estimate expected forfeitures for stock options 
we have not assumed any expected forfeitures for restricted stock units rsus because those awards have been granted to a small number of individuals 
for all unvested share based awards outstanding as of december   the previously measured but unrecognized compensation expense  based on the fair value at the original grant date  will be recognized on an accelerated basis in our statement of operations over the remaining vesting period  consistent with our recognition policy under sfas no 
for share based awards granted subsequent to december   we have elected to recognize compensation expense in the statement of operations on a straight line basis from the date of grant 
the following table contains the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model in each year to value stock based compensation year ended december  weighted average expected volatility expected term years risk free interest rate expected dividend yield 
table of contents impairment of long lived assets we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at least annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
because our history of negative operating cash flows is an indicator of impairment  we annually compare the market value of our equity and debt to the carrying value of our net assets 
during we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million for equipment that was no longer in use 
the market value of our equity and debt exceeded the carrying value of our net assets as of december  and  therefore  we did not record any impairment of long lived assets other than the impairment of the equipment mentioned above 
estimating expenses from contract research and development service providers some of our research and development is conducted by third parties  including contract research and development service providers 
at the end of each quarter  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated service provided  we record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs 
results of operations years ended december  and and outlook for our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the corresponding period in the following section explains the trends within each component of net loss for compared to and provides our estimate of trends for for each component 
revenue from collaborative agreements 
our revenues from collaborative agreements have historically been derived from a few major collaborators 
our collaborative agreements provide for some or all of the following elements license fees  research and development funding  milestone revenues  and royalties on product sales 
a summary of revenue recognized under our collaborative agreements for the years ended december  and is presented in the following table in thousands 
year ended december  novo nordisk research and development funding substantive milestones license fees biogenerix research and development funding license fees revenue from collaborative agreements increased slightly in from increased research and development funding and milestone revenue recognized during under our novo nordisk agreements were largely offset by decreased research and development funding during from biogenerix 
because our revenues could be substantially affected by entering into new collaborations and on the financial terms of any new collaborations  we cannot estimate our revenues 
material cash inflows from proprietary drug development projects are highly uncertain  and we cannot reasonably estimate the period in which we will begin to receive  if 
table of contents ever  material net cash inflows from our major research and development projects 
cash inflows from development stage products are dependent on several factors  including entering into collaborative agreements  the achievement of certain milestones  and regulatory approvals 
we may not receive milestone payments from any existing or future collaborations if a development stage product fails to meet technical or performance targets or fails to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
further  our revenues from collaborations will be affected by the levels of effort committed and made by our collaborative partners 
even if we achieve technical success in developing drug candidates  our collaborative partners may discontinue development  may not devote the resources necessary to complete development and commence marketing of these products  or they may not successfully market potential products 
research and development expense 
our lead therapeutic protein candidates are ne and glycopeg gcsf 
ne is a long acting version of epo produced in insect cells 
epo is prescribed to stimulate production of red blood cells  and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia and anemia associated with chronic renal failure 
ne is being developed for the treatment of anemia in adult cancer patients with non myeloid malignancies receiving chemotherapy and for the treatment of anemia associated with chronic kidney disease  including patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis 
during  we completed a phase i clinical trial for ne in switzerland 
in january  we received approval from swissmedic  the swiss agency for therapeutic products  for the initiation of a phase ii human trial to evaluate the safety  tolerability and dose response of ne in cancer patients receiving platinum based chemotherapy 
in march  we received clearance from the us food and drug administration fda to initiate clinical trials in the us in response to our amended investigational new drug application ind 
our second proprietary protein  glycopeg gcsf  is a long acting version of g csf that we are co developing with biogenerix ag  a company of the ratiopharm group 
g csf is prescribed to stimulate production of neutrophils a type of white blood cell and is approved for sale in major markets around the world for treatment of neutropenia associated with myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
in november  biogenerix initiated the first of two planned phase i clinical trials for glycopeg gcsf 
we expect biogenerix to initiate and complete the second phase i trial during we conduct exploratory research  both independently and with collaborators  on therapeutic candidates  primarily proteins  for development using our enzymatic technologies 
successful candidates may be advanced for development through our own proprietary drug program or through our partnering and licensing program  or a combination of the two 
although our primary focus is the development of long acting proteins  we are also conducting research to assess opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in other areas  such as glycopeptides and glycolipids 
we expect to continue this research during our current research and development projects are divided between two categories i glycopegylation and ii other glycotechnology programs  which includes projects investigating opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in other areas  such as glycolipids 
the following chart sets forth our projects in each of these categories and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status glycopegylation ne clinical phase ii active glycopeg gcsf clinical phase i active other protein projects research active other glycotechnology programs non protein therapeutic applications research active nutritional applications n a evaluating outlicensing opportunities the process of bringing drugs from the preclinical research and development stage through phase i  phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials to fda or other regulatory approval is time consuming and expensive 
because our announced product candidates are currently in the early clinical and preclinical stages  and there are a variety of potential intermediate clinical and non clinical outcomes that are inherent in drug development  we cannot reasonably estimate either the timing or costs we will incur to complete these research and development projects 
in addition  the timing and costs to complete our research and development projects will be affected by the timing and nature of any collaboration agreements we may enter into with a third party  neither of which we can currently estimate 

table of contents for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials  and supplies for each project 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and non clinical development costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property  and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 
our research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in during  we expect our research and development expenses to be significantly higher than they were in as a result of anticipated clinical trial  non clinical study  and process development costs associated with ne the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands year ended december  glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses glycopegylation our glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased non clinical study costs associated with ne and glycopeg gcsf  as well as increased clinical trial costs associated with ne these increases were partially offset by lower payroll and related personnel costs due to reduced headcount in increased purchases of laboratory services and research supplies also contributed to the overall increase 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs decreased during  compared to  primarily due to reduced research efforts during for early stage research 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses decreased during  compared to  primarily due to decreased depreciation resulting from the august impairment of our witmer road facility and the closure of our leased facility in san diego 
further contributing to the decrease during were lower amounts spent for indirect outside laboratory services and consulting  and was partially offset by million of non cash compensation costs for share based payment arrangements accounted for under sfas no 
r 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the corresponding period in the increase in was primarily attributable to million of non cash compensation costs for share based payment arrangements accounted for under sfas no 
r  and was partially offset by lower consulting costs  lower patent legal expenses and reduced depreciation resulting from the august impairment of our witmer road facility and the closure of our leased facility in san diego 
during  we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain relatively consistent with the expense amounts 

table of contents gain on sale of witmer road facility 
during  we recognized a gain from the sale of the witmer road facility of million 
in september  we sold the witmer road facility for approximately million 
after payment of selling fees and expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the carrying value of the property and equipment sold was million 
we continued to occupy a portion of the facility on a rent free basis for six months after the closing 
we estimated the rental fair value for the space we continued to occupy to be million  which was included in the calculation of the million gain on the sale of the witmer road facility and is being amortized as rent expense to our statements of operations over the expected period of our occupancy 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges for the year ended december  were million  which included million of non cash property and equipment impairment charges and million of payments for employee severance and facility closure costs 
we did not incur any restructuring charges during interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the corresponding period in the decrease was due to lower available cash balances during our interest income during is difficult to project  and will depend largely on whether we enter into any new collaborative agreements  complete any equity or debt financings  and prevailing interest rates during interest expense 
interest expense for each of the years ended december  and was million 
our interest expense during is difficult to project and will depend largely on whether we complete any new debt financings and prevailing interest rates during see financing activities debt financing activities in the liquidity and capital resources section of this annual report on form k for a description of the material features of our debt financings

a summary of revenue recognized under our collaborative agreements for the years ended december  and is presented in the following table in thousands 
year ended december  novo nordisk research and development funding substantive milestones license fees biogenerix research and development funding license fees revenue from collaborative agreements increased to million in from million in primarily due to increased research and development funding and license fee revenue from biogenerix 
research and development expense 
our research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the following table illustrates research and development expenses incurred during and in each period for our significant groups of research and development projects in thousands 

table of contents year ended december  glycopegylation other glycotechnology programs indirect expenses glycopegylation our glycopegylation research and development expenses increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased non clinical development costs associated with ne and glycopeg gcsf  and increased purchases of laboratory services and research supplies 
other glycotechnology programs research and development expenses related to our other glycotechnology programs increased during  compared to  primarily due to increased research during to assess opportunities to use our enzymatic technologies in glycolipids 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses decreased during  compared to  primarily due to decreased depreciation resulting from the august impairment of the witmer road facility and the closure of our leased facility in san diego 
further contributing to the decrease during were lower amounts spent for indirect outside laboratory services and consulting 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the corresponding period in the decrease in was attributable to lower salaries and personnel related expenses  lower consulting costs  and reduced depreciation  which resulted from the august impairment of the witmer road facility and the closure of our leased facility in san diego 
partially offsetting these decreases were an increase in patent legal expenses as well as higher non cash compensation expenses due to the issuance of restricted stock units 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges for the year ended december  were million  which included million of non cash property and equipment impairment charges and million of expected payments for employee severance and facility closure costs 
we did not incur any restructuring charges during interest income 
interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the corresponding period in the increase was due to higher interest rates during interest expense 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the corresponding period in  primarily due to higher interest rates during the increase was also partially attributable to the fact that we did not capitalize any interest expense during during  we capitalized million of interest expense associated with leasehold improvements that we placed in service in april

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
we are currently not engaged in hedging activities and we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
we do not believe that our exposure to interest rate risk is material to our results of operations 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of our interest income and expense to selected changes in market interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations and maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
we seek the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in high credit quality institutional money market funds and fixed income securities 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings are also exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
because our investments are short term in duration  we believe our exposure to interest rate risk is not significant 
we held no marketable securities as of december  the approximate principal amount of our investment portfolio as of december  was million  and the weighted average annualized interest rate and interest income earned on the portfolio during the year ended december  were and million  respectively 
the sensitivity analysis as it 
table of contents relates to our investment activities assumes an instantaneous basis point move in interest rates from their weighted average levels during the year ended december  a basis point move up or down in market interest rates would have caused a corresponding change of million in interest income during the year ended december  as of december   the principal components of our debt portfolio were a term loan from our landlord of million that accrues interest at a fixed annual rate of  aggregate equipment financing of million that accrues interest at fixed annual rates ranging from to  and capital lease obligations with a present value of million  for which we imputed interest at fixed annual rates ranging from to 
our aggregate interest expense for the year ended december  was million 
by modifying the interest expense associated with variable rate debt while it was outstanding during the year ended december   as well as for fixed rate debt entered into during the year ended december   a basis point move up or down in market interest rates would have caused a corresponding change of million in interest expense during the year ended december  foreign exchange risk we have entered into some agreements denominated  wholly or partly  in euros or other foreign currencies  and  in the future  we may enter into additional  significant agreements denominated in foreign currencies 
if the values of these currencies increase against the dollar  our costs would increase 
to date  we have not entered into any contracts to reduce the risk of fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in the future  depending upon the amounts payable under any such agreements  we may enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to reduce the risk of unpredictable changes in these costs 
however  due to the variability of timing and amount of payments under any such agreements  foreign exchange contracts may not mitigate the potential adverse impact on our financial results
