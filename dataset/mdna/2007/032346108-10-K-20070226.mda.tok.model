item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary amylin pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes  obesity and other diseases through the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative medicines 
we have developed and gained approval for two first in class medicines to treat diabetes  byetta exenatide injection and symlin pramlintide acetate injection  both of which were commercially launched in the united states during the second quarter of byetta has also been approved in the european union  or eu  and we expect the commercial launch of byetta in various eu member states to occur in  through our collaboration partner  eli lilly and company  or lilly 
we also have two late stage programs in development and multiple early stage programs 
byetta is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called incretin mimetics 
we began selling byetta in the united states in june byetta is approved in the united states for the treatment of patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate glycemic control and are taking metformin  sulfonylurea and or a thiazolidinedones  or tzd  the three most common oral therapies for type diabetes 
net product sales of byetta were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have an agreement with lilly for the global development and commercialization of exenatide 
this agreement includes byetta and any long acting release formulations of exenatide such as exenatide lar 
under the terms of the agreement  operating profits from products sold in the united states are shared equally between lilly and us 
on october  we and lilly amended the agreement  which became effective january  prior to amending the agreement  operating profits for exenatide  including any long acting release formulations  outside of the united states were shared to lilly and to us 
the amended agreement provides for tiered royalties payable to us by lilly based upon the annual gross margin for all exenatide product sales  including any long acting release formulations  outside of the united states 
royalty payments for exenatide product sales outside of the united states will commence after a one time cumulative gross margin threshold amount has been met 
we expect royalty payments to commence in in addition  effective january   lilly will be responsible for of the costs related to development of twice daily byetta for sale outside of the united states 
development costs related to all other exenatide products for sale outside of the united states will continue to be allocated to lilly and to us 
lilly will continue to be responsible for of the costs related to commercialization of all exenatide products for sale outside of the united states 
symlin is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called amylinomimetics 
we began selling symlin in the united states in april for the treatment of patients with either type or type diabetes who are treated with mealtime insulin but who have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
net product sales of symlin were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have a field force of approximately people dedicated to marketing byetta and symlin in the united states 
our field force includes our specialty and primary care sales forces  a managed care and government affairs organization  a medical science organization and diabetes care specialists 
lilly co promotes byetta in the united states and has primary responsibility for developing and commercializing byetta outside of the united states  including any long acting release formulations 
in addition to our marketed products  we have several programs in development  including late stage programs for diabetes and obesity 
in diabetes  we are working with lilly and alkermes  inc to develop exenatide lar  to enable once weekly administration of exenatide for the treatment of type diabetes 
we are currently conducting a clinical study evaluating the exenatide lar in patients with type diabetes designed to generate the type of safety and efficacy data that could form the basis of a new drug application  or an nda  submission to the united states food and drug administration  or fda 
in addition  we and lilly are working with alkermes and parsons  inc on the construction of a manufacturing facility for exenatide lar in ohio 
we expect to complete the commercial scale manufacturing process in this facility in the second half of we have multiple early stage programs for diabetes and obesity 
we have a number of compounds in development for the potential treatment of obesity which are part of a broader program which we refer to as into integrated neurohormonal therapies for obesity 
as part of this program  we are currently conducting four clinical trials of our drug candidates  or combinations of our drug candidates 
we also maintain an active discovery research program focused on novel peptide therapeutics 
we are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
we have partnered with pyschogenics  inc  to form psylin neurosciences  inc  a company that will focus on the discovery and development of peptide hormones for treatment of psychiatric indications 
recent developments byetta received fda approval in december for use of byetta as an add on therapy to improve blood sugar control in patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate control on a tzd alone or with metformin 
received marketing authorization for byetta from the european commission in november for the treatment of type diabetes in the eu as adjunctive therapy to improve blood sugar control in patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate glycemic control on metformin and or a sulfonylurea  two common oral diabetes medications 
received fda approval in february for storage of byetta at room temperature not to exceed degrees fahrenheit after first use 
continued efforts to expand the market potential for byetta in the united states including the initiation of a clinical study evaluating byetta as a stand alone therapy for patients with type diabetes 
symlin submitted two supplemental new drug applications  or snda s  to the fda for the approval of a disposable pen delivery system for symlin and for the approval of the use of symlin at mealtime in patients with type diabetes treated with once daily basal insulin 
late stage development programs initiated a clinical study of exenatide lar in patients with type diabetes in march to assess whether once weekly exenatide lar is at least as effective in improving glucose control as twice daily byetta 
this study is designed to generate the type of safety and efficacy data that could form the basis of an nda 
made continued progress in the construction of our manufacturing facility for exenatide lar in ohio  and remain on schedule to complete the commercial scale manufacturing process at this facility in the second half of in addition  we successfully manufactured commercial scale engineering batches of exenatide lar at a third party manufacturer 
reported results from a week phase dose ranging study evaluating the safety and weight effects of pramlintide  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in symlin  in obese subjects 
reported results from a phase extension study demonstrating that patients completing weeks of pramlintide therapy experienced a mean body weight reduction depending upon dose compared to a reduction in patients receiving placebo 
early stage programs and research commenced an extensive program of clinical trials which will assess the safety and efficacy of multiple neurohormones used in combination with pramlintide to treat obesity  which is referred to as our into clinical research program 
financial and operational expanded our field force by approximately people to a total of approximately  and together with the lilly field organization  expanded our capacity to reach approximately  physicians  representing a increase in physicians reached 
completed a public offering of million shares of common stock in april  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
converted million of convertible notes issued in and due  referred to as the notes  into approximately million shares of our common stock 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs and  more recently  to the commercialization of our products 
all of our revenues prior to the second quarter of were derived from fees and expense reimbursements under our byetta collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements  and previous co promotion agreements 
during the second quarter of  we began to derive revenues from product sales of byetta and symlin 
we have been unprofitable since inception and may incur additional operating losses for at least the next few years 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we may not generate positive operating cash flows for at least the next few years and accordingly  we may need to raise additional funds from outside sources 
refer to the discussions under the headings liquidity and capital resources below and cautionary factors that may affect future results in part i  item a for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory costs  research and development expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and milestones earned and for reimbursement of development costs based on contractual arrangements 
net product sales we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn  sell to retail pharmacies  pharmacy benefit managers and government entities 
decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the level of inventories they hold  and thus the amount of product they purchase  can materially affect the level of our product sales in any particular period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when delivery has occurred and title has transferred to our wholesale customers  net of allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts and prescription vouchers 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
product returns we do not offer our wholesale customers a general right of return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are damaged or defective when received by the wholesale customer or for any unopened product during the period beginning six months prior to and up to months subsequent to its expiration date 
we estimate product returns based on the experience of our collaborative partner  industry trends for other products with similar characteristics and our historical returns experience 
additionally  we consider several other factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  the expiration dates of product shipped and third party data to assist us in monitoring estimated channel inventory levels and prescription trends 
actual returns could exceed our historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
to date actual returns have not differed materially from our estimates 
rebates and wholesaler chargebacks allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program and contracted discounts with commercial payors 
rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector eg medicaid benefit providers 
the allowance for rebates is based on contractual discount rates  expected utilization under each contract and our estimate of the amount of inventory in the distribution channel that will become subject to such rebates 
our estimates for expected utilization for rebates are based on historical rebate claims and to a lesser extent third party market research data 
rebates are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
wholesaler chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which currently consist primarily of federal government entities purchasing off the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to the company the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on expected utilization of these programs and reported wholesaler inventory levels 
actual rebates and wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual rebate claims and wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates 
wholesaler discounts wholesaler discounts consist of prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees 
we offer all of our wholesale customers a prompt pay discount within the first days after the date of the invoice 
distribution service fees arise from contractual agreements with certain of our wholesale customers for distribution services they provide to us and are generally a fixed percentage of their purchases of our products in a given period 
prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees are recorded as a reduction to gross sales in the period the sales occur 
the allowance for wholesaler discounts is based upon actual data of product sales to wholesale customers and not on estimates 
prescription vouchers prescription vouchers result in amounts owed to pharmacies that have redeemed vouchers for a free prescription 
we provide prescription vouchers to physicians  who in turn distribute them to patients 
patients may redeem a voucher at a pharmacy for a free prescription 
we reimburse the pharmacy for the price it paid the wholesaler for the medicine and record this reimbursement as a reduction to gross sales 
the allowance for prescription vouchers is based on the number of unredeemed vouchers in circulation  and the estimated utilization rate 
the estimated utilization rate is based on our historical utilization rates experience with prescription vouchers 
generally  prescription vouchers are issued and expire in the same fiscal quarter 
accordingly  our allowance for prescription vouchers is based upon actual utilization in the period in which the prescription vouchers were issued 
revenues under collaborative agreements amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
amounts received for milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
amounts received for equalization of development expenses are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
valuation of stock based compensation we adopted financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas r  share based payment  on january  sfas r requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas r  we recorded million  or per share  of stock based compensation during year ended december  at december   unamortized non cash  stock based compensation expense was million and is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payments to employees using the black scholes model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of employee stock options  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options and the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock with various maturities between six months and two years  consistent with the guidance in sfas r and the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we estimated volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options 
the determination to use implied volatility in addition to historical volatility was based upon the availability of data related to actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that the addition of implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
the expected life of our employee stock options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding in consideration of historical exercise patterns and the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the mid point of the then current date and their maximum contractual term 
the risk free interest rates are based on the yield curve of united states treasury strip securities in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of our employee stock options 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock based payments to employees 
if factors underlying the above assumptions change in future periods  the associated estimated non cash  stock based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
inventories and related reserves inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for symlin and byetta 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for production failures and potential product expiration 
the manufacturing processes for our products are complex 
deviations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures and additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory due to expiration may also result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze the shelf life  expiration dates and internal sales forecasts  each on a product by product basis 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials and develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have historically not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have fully reserved for these deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income in that same period 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the provisions of fin will be effective for us beginning january  we are in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas will be effective for us beginning january  the company is in the process of determining the effect  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 
in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
addresses quantifying the financial statement effects of misstatements  specifically  how the effects of prior year uncorrected errors must be considered in quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
the provisions of sab no 
are effective in fiscal year for us 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations net product sales net product sales net product sales for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  and consisted of sales of byetta and symlin  less allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts  and prescription vouchers 
there were no net product sales in as these products were not approved for sale until the following table provides information regarding net product sales in millions year ended december  byetta symlin the increases in net product sales for byetta and symlin for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily reflect continued growth in patient use 
revenues under collaborative agreements the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payments recognition of milestone payments cost sharing payments substantially all of the revenue recorded in these periods consists of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration agreement with lilly for exenatide  and consists primarily of the amortization of up front payments  milestone payments and cost sharing payments 
the amortization of up front payments for the years ended december   and consists of the continued amortization of million of the million non refundable initial payment made to us by lilly upon the signing of our collaboration agreement for exenatide in september we are amortizing this million portion of the initial payment to revenue ratably over a seven year period  representing our estimate of the period of our performance of significant development activities under the agreement 
the remaining million portion of the initial payment was amortized to revenue prior to milestone payments relate to certain development and commercialization events defined in the exenatide collaboration agreement 
we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon the achievement of performance requirements underlying such milestone payments and  for certain development milestones  the expiration of stock conversion rights associated with such payments 
cost sharing payments consist of amounts payable by lilly to us to equalize development expenses under our collaboration agreement 
while we continue to lead exenatide and exenatide lar development efforts in the united states  lilly also incurs exenatide development expenses and makes cost sharing payments to us to equalize development costs  which are recorded as revenues under collaborative agreements in the period in which the related development expenses are incurred 
the million decrease in revenues under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects a reduction in milestone payments  partially offset by an increase in cost sharing payments 
milestone payments in consisted of the recognition of million of milestones earned in connection with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of byetta in the united states 
the increase in cost sharing payments in  as compared to primarily reflects increased development expenses for exenatide lar in as compared to the million increase in revenues under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects an increase in milestone revenue due to the recognition of million of milestones discussed above  partially offset by a reduction in cost sharing payments due to lower development expenses for byetta in as compared to in future periods  revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of ongoing cost sharing payments from lilly to equalize united states development costs  possible future milestone payments and the continued amortization of the million portion of the up front payment 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million  representing a gross margin of  and million  representing a gross margin of  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no cost of goods sold for as we did not begin selling byetta and symlin until the second quarter of costs of goods sold is comprised primarily of manufacturing costs associated with byetta and symlin sales during the period 
the improvement in gross margin in as compared to primarily reflects lower unit costs for byetta due to higher production volumes 
quarterly fluctuations in gross margins may be influenced by product mix and the level of sales allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared to primarily reflects the full annual effect of the expansion of our commercial capabilities to support the launches of byetta and symlin  the continued expansion in of these capabilities  including the addition of approximately individuals to our field force  increased marketing activities  including medical education  market research and product sampling for byetta  growth in our business infrastructure and million of stock based compensation 
we  along with lilly  are jointly responsible for the co promotion of byetta within the united states  and share equally in sales force costs and external marketing expenses 
accordingly  our selling  general and administrative expenses include our share of these costs in the united states 
the million increase in as compared to reflects the expansion of our commercial capabilities and additions to our business infrastructure to support the commercial launches of byetta and symlin in this includes the hiring and training of our field force  expanded marketing and medical education activities  the establishment of customer service capabilities and related administrative support 
selling general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase in due to the full annual cost of our field force of people  of which approximately were added during the fourth quarter of  increases in marketing costs for byetta and increases in business infrastructure to support our growth 
research and development expenses currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in various stages of development 
from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily byetta and exenatide lar 
in we initiated our program for the treatment of obesity with pramlintide and in we commenced our into clinical research program for obesity 
the drug development process in the united states includes a series of steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation of a potential drug candidate in humans 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during phase  which consists of trials that are typically both the longest and largest conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labeling and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development expenses are comprised of salaries and benefits  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  develop and manufacture drug materials and delivery devices  and a portion of our facilities costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our overall pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internally shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table sets forth information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects in millions year ended december  increase byetta symlin late stage programs early stage programs and research unallocated research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in primarily reflects increased expenses associated with both our early stage and late stage programs  increased expenses associated with byetta and increased expenses for our unallocated research and development expenses 
the increase in expenses for our early stage programs and research primarily reflects costs associated with our acquisition of the rights to leptin from amgen in early  costs associated with our obesity programs and growth in our preclinical research 
the increase in expenses for our late stage programs primarily reflects costs associated with the development of exenatide lar including costs associated with manufacturing scale up and the ongoing clinical study discussed above 
the increase in expenses for byetta primarily reflects costs associated with label expansion activities 
the increase in our unallocated research and development expenses primarily reflects increased facilities costs to support growth in our research and development activities 
the following table sets forth information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects in millions year ended december  increase decrease byetta symlin late stage programs early stage programs and research unallocated the million increase in as compared to reflects increased expenses associated with our early stage programs and research  our late stage programs  and symlin development expenses  partially offset by reduced expenses for our byetta and unallocated research and development expenses 
the increased expenses in our early stage programs and research is due to further investments in our discovery research activities  increased costs associated with preclinical development of potential drug candidates and costs associated with an increased number of employees to support these activities 
the increase in expenses for our late stage programs in as compared to primarily reflects costs associated with the clinical development of exenatide lar and our obesity program for pramlintide as well as increased costs associated with manufacturing scale up for exenatide lar 
the increase in symlin development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects increased clinical development costs associated with an open label study evaluating symlin use in clinical practice 
the decrease in byetta development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects reduced clinical development costs following the completion of activities required to support regulatory approval of byetta in  which included open label extensions of the pivotal phase clinical studies for byetta and costs associated with manufacturing scale up 
the decrease in unallocated research and development expenses in as compared to primarily reflects additional emphasis on development activities in our late stage and early stage programs 
collaborative profit sharing collaborative profit sharing was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and consists of lilly s share of the gross margin for byetta sales in the united states 
there was no collaborative profit sharing in  as byetta was not approved for sale until make whole payment on debt redemption in july  we called for the redemption on august  of all our outstanding notes under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of our common stock exceeding certain thresholds 
all holders elected to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we issued approximately million shares  including  shares as a make whole payment  representing per  principal amount of the notes converted less interest actually paid 
in connection with this make whole payment  we recorded a non cash  non operating charge of million during the third quarter of interest and other income and expense interest and other income consists primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in and million in the increase in both and primarily reflects higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates in as compared to the increase in primarily reflects higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates in as compared to interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expense resulting from long term debt obligations and includes interest payments and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to reflects lower interest expense following the august redemption of our notes 
the increase in compared to reflects a full year of interest expense for the million of convertible senior notes issued in april  referred to as our notes 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in our net loss for the year ended december  includes million of stock based compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r on january  the increase in our net loss in  compared to primarily reflects the increased costs and expenses and decreased revenues under collaborative agreements  partially offset by the increases in net product sales and interest and other income discussed above 
the increase in our net loss in compared to reflects the increased costs and expenses  partially offset by the increases in net product sales and revenue  under collaborative agreements discussed above 
we may incur operating losses for the next few years 
our ability to reach profitability in the future will be heavily dependent upon the amount of product sales that we achieve for byetta and symlin 
in addition  ongoing and potential increased expenses associated with the commercialization of byetta and symlin  and expenses associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our research and development programs  including our ongoing late stage programs and our early stage development programs  and related support infrastructure may impact our ability to reach profitability in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public sales and private placements of our common and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our byetta collaboration with lilly  reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements  and since the second quarter of  through product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  in april we completed a public offering of million shares of our common stock  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
we used cash of million  million and million for our operating activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash used for operating activities in included uses of cash due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable reflects growth in our net product sales and the increase in inventories reflects increased inventory purchases to support this growth 
our cash used for operating activities in included sources of cash for increases in our current liabilities  including an increase of million in accounts payable  an increase of million in accrued compensation  an increase of million in payable to collaborative partner and an increase of million in other current liabilities 
the increase in accounts payable primarily reflects growth in our expenses generally and accounts payable timing differences 
the increase in accrued compensation primarily reflects growth in our number of employees 
the increase in payable to collaborative partner  which represents lilly s share of byetta gross margins in the united states  reflects increased net product sales for byetta and an improvement in gross margins 
the increase in other current liabilities primarily reflects growth in sales allowances due to increased net product sales and an increase in accrued capital additions related to the ongoing construction of our manufacturing facility for exenatide lar 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in and million in the increase in primarily reflects costs associated with our manufacturing facility for exenatide lar and  to a lesser extent  purchases of tenant improvements  office equipment and scientific equipment to support our growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will continue to significantly increase in future periods due primarily to costs associated with ongoing construction of our manufacturing facility for exenatide lar 
we expect to complete the commercial scale manufacturing process in the second half of at an estimated cost of up to approximately million 
we are also evaluating the potential to expand this project based on the progress of exenatide lar through the development process which could increase our capital expenditures significantly 
in addition  we anticipate continued investments in tenant improvements  office equipment and scientific equipment 
we are evaluating various forms of secured debt financing to fund a portion of the cost of our manufacturing facility 
in addition  we are evaluating the potential utility of other financing mechanisms  including revolving credit lines or similar facilities  which may be secured by our inventories  accounts receivable or other assets 
financing activities provided cash of million  million  and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities in included approximately million in net proceeds from a public offering of our common stock in april  proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from sales of common stock and the issuance of convertible senior notes  partially offset by principal payments on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
in august  we completed the redemption of all of the notes 
in connection with the redemption we issued approximately million shares of common stock to note holders upon the conversion of all of the outstanding notes 
in connection with the conversion  we also issued  shares as a make whole payment  representing per  principal value of the converted notes less interest actually paid 
at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of the notes outstanding 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share 
the notes are not redeemable at our option

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in united states government securities  asset backed securities and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities  and therefore the risk of loss due to interest rate risk is considered to be low 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
at december   the fair value of our notes was million 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
